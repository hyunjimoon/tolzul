⚡TOLTOL: Map 5-model progression to 3D space (state×depth×action)
🧲ZULZUL: Freedom evolves from level→limitation→flexibility→precision

→ $/time test:
  Deliver? 3D visualization × Model clarity = ✓
  Sell? Management Science × Rigorous progression = ✓

**Learning**: External dimensions (3D plot) reveal internal evolution (decision freedom)

## Integration from Existing Knowledge:

### From [[⚡toltol/people_analysis/]] (External patterns)
- Related person: [[⚡toltol/people_analysis/🗺️atom(PCO⬆️⬇️)/charlie_fine.md]] - systematic optimizer
- Quick pattern: Number models 1-5, not creative names
 
### From [[🧲zulzul/ops4entrep/]] (Internal frameworks)  
- Theory connection: [[🧲zulzul/ops4entrep/joker-framework.md]] - balance exploration/exploitation
- Deep principle: Promise precision = f(level, limitation, flexibility)

### From [[3_🐅professionalize-processify/]] (Operations)
- Academic backing: [[3_🐅/🫀bayes/optimal-stopping.md]]
- Method: [[3_🐅/✋operations/🤙prior(promise)/]]

## 8 TODO Items (from brown numbers):

1. [⚡] Fix notation: φ not "five", consistent throughout
2. [🧲] Map GaNS baseline clearly as Model 1 foundation
3. [⚡] Draw 3D progression plot: (0,0,0)→(1,0,0)→(2,0,0)→(2,1,0)→(2,1,2)
4. [🧲] Solve Model 3: φ* = {1 if VSD=max, 0.5 if VSD≫}
5. [🧲] Solve Model 4: μ* convergence when τ→∞
6. [⚡] Add convex d(φ) for Model 3b analysis
7. [🧲] Prove Model 5: optimal τ* = f(μ, c, VSD)
8. [⚡] Create table: Decision variables by model (0→φ→φ→μ,φ→μ,τ)

## Model Evolution Summary:

### Model 1: Freedom-Level (자유-수준)
- State: (0,0,0) → No decision variable
- P(success) exogenous

### Model 2: Freedom-Level Extended  
- State: (1,0,0) → φ ∈ [0,1]
- Promise level affects success

### Model 3: Finite/Limited (유한)
- State: (2,0,0) → Branching: Sell vs Deliver
- Trade-off: d(φ) = delivery probability

### Model 4: Flexible (유연)
- State: (2,1,0) → Added depth dimension
- μ = prior mean for promise

### Model 5: Discrete/Precision (이산/정밀도)
- State: (2,1,2) → Added action dimension
- τ = sample size optimization
- Cost: c·ln(τ)
