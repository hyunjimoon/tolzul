        🐢 Can?                👾 User?
   Formalize curiosity     People seeking to
   as $/energy ratio       understand social
   (probability,           dynamics & make
   optimization)           engagement choices
              \                  /
               \                /
         Deliver? ←→  Sell?
                /              \
               /                \
        🐅 Goal?              🐙 Offer?  
    Map personality        Framework for
    prediction to          assessing who's
    engagement            worth engaging
    decisions             with (eyes, energy)

**Deliver**: 🐅×🐢 = ✓ Mathematical formalization enables systematic personality assessment
**Sell**: 👾×🐙 = ✓ People want practical tools for social decision-making
**$/time**: ✓ High value through efficient social filtering

**Learning**: Interesting = (Unpredictability × Distance from population mean) / Energy required. Eyes reveal resistance/pushback which signals worthwhile engagement.

## Key Insights from Conversation

### 1. The Curiosity-Energy Formula
- Monetizing curiosity: $ earned per curiosity solved / energy invested
- Loud people = high denominator (energy) + low numerator (curiosity) = bad deal
- Exception: if something distinct beyond loudness (e.g., unique fashion)

### 2. Types of Interesting
- **Unpredictable + High Energy**: Avoided gaze person (what are they hiding?)
- **Predictable but Far from Mean**: Vernon's poetic academic writing
- **Style Variance**: Personal mean ≠ population mean but still predictable

### 3. Decision Framework
- High energy state → Choose unpredictable (avoided gaze)
- Low energy state → Choose predictable but unique
- Eyes reveal: resistance, strength, playfulness (forms of pushback)

### 4. State vs Action Model
- State (changes faster): emotions, knowledge, eye contact patterns
- Action (requires effort): choosing to engage, speaking
- Entrepreneurial world ≠ RL grid (no fixed states/actions)

## Angie's Capability
"I'm good at re-presenting others' thoughts using analogy and formalizing them (probability, statistics, optimization)"
- Decomposition: population mean (X̄) vs personal mean (X̄ᵢ) vs instance (Xᵢⱼ)
- Conditional structure: P(action | emotional state)
- Optimization: maximize curiosity/energy ratio
