- **Feynman's Original Method for Genius**: Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman made it a practice to keep about a dozen "favorite problems" constantly in his mind. [[1]](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/think-like-feynman-why-you-should-have-12-favorite-problems/) These were not necessarily urgent tasks, but big, open-ended questions he was deeply curious about, such as "How can I accurately keep track of time in my head?" or "What is the unifying principle underlying light, radio, magnetism, and electricity?". [[2]](https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/)[[3]](https://favoriteproblems.com/) The idea, as described by his contemporary Gian-Carlo Rota, was that every time Feynman encountered a new piece of information or "trick," he would test it against his twelve problems to see if it offered a new angle or a potential solution. [[2]](https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/)[[4]](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/12-favorite-problems/) This created a fertile ground for making unexpected connections and led to breakthroughs that others often attributed to sheer genius. [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GhC1Exo50U)
    
- **Adoption in "Building a Second Brain"**: Productivity author Tiago Forte incorporated this concept as a foundational exercise in his popular personal knowledge management (PKM) methodology, "Building a Second Brain". [[6]](https://parentotheca.com/2024/02/18/building-a-second-brain-tiago-forte-summary/)[[7]](https://little.zachphillips.blog/2021/04/09/my-favorite-problems.html) Forte encourages people to define their own twelve favorite problems to act as a guiding filter for the massive amount of information they encounter daily. [[8]](https://medium.com/@RationalBadger/my-7-takeaways-from-building-your-second-brain-by-tiago-forte-44ff6ed93ff1)[[9]](https://juliasaxena.com/12-favorite-problems-pop-writing-how-to-ask-better-questions/) In the context of building a digital "second brain," these questions help you decide what content is meaningful enough to capture and how it might connect to your long-term personal and professional goals. [[6]](https://parentotheca.com/2024/02/18/building-a-second-brain-tiago-forte-summary/)[[10]](https://www.nathancashion.com/blog/2022/9/12-favorite-problems)
    
- **The Purpose and Benefit**: The ultimate goal of this practice is to transform you from a passive consumer of information into an active creator of knowledge and solutions. [[11]](https://bernardzitzer.com/12-favorite-problems/) By keeping these personally meaningful questions at the forefront, you prime your brain to recognize relevant information, incubate ideas over time, and spot serendipitous connections between seemingly unrelated topics. [[2]](https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/)[[6]](https://parentotheca.com/2024/02/18/building-a-second-brain-tiago-forte-summary/) This method provides a practical framework for focusing your attention, nurturing curiosity, and making consistent progress on the challenges and interests that matter most to you.
