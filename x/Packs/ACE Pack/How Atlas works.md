An Atlas is a "map of maps". In this way, the Atlas folder contains your maps of content (MOCs), ideas, sources, and other bits of knowledge. These notes are important to our understanding of the world; they deserve their own folder.

For ***developing ideas***, I have links to each step of the ARC Framework: [[Add]], [[Relate]], [[Communicate]]. 

For ***managing knowledge***, the Atlas folder has three subfolders: Dots, Maps, and Sources. Go to the [[Atlas]] note for guidance on the folder structure.

[[Collections]] are special kinds of maps that automatically display notes that link to them via the `collection` property. I have many collections, but a few current favorites for the atlas are: [[Things]], [[Statements]], and [[Quotes]].

My favorite maps to catalyze my mind are my [[Thinking Map]] and [[Concepts Map]]. Both have been incredibly enjoyable to develop and revisit. For orienting my mind I turn to the [[Life Map]] and for orienting my system for knowledge, I turn to the [[PKM Map]].
