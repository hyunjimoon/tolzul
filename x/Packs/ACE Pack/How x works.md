**The "x" folder stands for "extras."** It's an easy way to tuck away those "extra" types of notes, such as:

- Notes about notes: Vault-related notes
- Non-notes: Images, PDFs, and other file types
- Utility notes: Templates
- Archived notes

But it's more than that. *It's a release valve for organizational angst.* I use in constantly for less immediately relevant "placeholder folders." While not overly important now, these folders still serve you as a tucked away reminder of a topic or area of simmering or potential interest. This is really important!

The "x" folder works incredibly well anywhere, whether it's in Obsidian or in your computer's file folder system. Use them liberally. Use them at any level. For example, you'll notice an "x" folder within the `Dots` folderâ€”and even within the `x` folder!

Over time, you may have a growing number subfolders in your Dots folder (or you can just keep everything flat too, like a real zen master). For example, I have a "People" subfolder because I want to have notes on people, ancient and alive. But if I was an amateur chef with a growing number of recipe notes, I'd put a "Recipes" folder here. Or, if I was making building a personal library of important exercises, I'd likely make an "Exercises" folder. 

 Over time, several folders like these might clutter any folder you twirl oepn. If you ever get that feeling, just tuck them away in an "x" folder. Problem solved. The extra folder called `x` is where you can stuff collections of notes you don't really need to see when you twirl into any folder. 

Along with being a way to relieve the stress of unneeded and distracting folder management angst, *"x" folders conveniently sort at the bottom of alphabetical lists*, making them a reliable and constant part of any folder structure that might need them.
