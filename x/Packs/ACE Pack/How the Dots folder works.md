Dots are **any bit of knowledge**. Connecting the dots often leads to meaningful leaps of insights, creative breakthroughs, and valuable contributions. You might think of dots as concepts, or quotes, but they also include any "thing" and even "statements about things". 

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works.

### Umami
The dots folder is one of my favorite places because it has *umami*. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitternessâ€”and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind. 

[[Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge]].
