# Installation & Quick Start 

This pack comes with Ideaverse Pro 2.0. It should already be in `x/Packs/`.

If you want to add this pack to another vault, just copy over this parent folder. 

# Dependencies

No plugins or themes are required, but a few will give you the best experience.

- Required:
	- None
- Recommended:
	- Plugins:
		- Dataview. It will render results in many notes based on where those notes live in the ACE folders.
	- Theme: 
		- LYT's "Soft Paper" theme via the AnuPpuccin theme. It colors each folder in a distinct way. 

# Usage Spectrum

Here are different approaches to using this pack, from simple to complex.

- **Level 1 (🍃 Lightweight)** - Just use the root level folders. Throw any note into one of the five folders: `+, Atlas, Calendar, Efforts, x`. Don't do anything else.
- **Level 2 (🌞 Enlightened)**- Slowly get comfortable using more and more of the subfolders.
- **Level 3 (🌈 Illuminated)** - Use templates for different types of notes.
- **Level 4 (🌠 Supernova)** - Leverage collection notes and other queries.
