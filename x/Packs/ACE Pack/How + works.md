When a flash of inspiration hits, can you capture the spark? That's what the `+` folder is for. Any time you create a new note, it gets added there. You don't have to worry about organizing it until later.  Then later, when you're ready, just twirl down the `+` folder and start processing the notes you see. Or, you can go to the [[Add]] note, which sorts the newest notes for you. 

To add a new note, just hit the universal command of `cmd-n` on the Mac (and `ctrl-n` on Windows).

### Have a spark? Make a remark! 
If it's coming from the outside-in, make a new note to begin. 
- Write in your own words, and link to another note. 

If it's coming from the inside-out, just get it out. 
- Open your daily note and start freewriting or freetalking. 
- For more guidance, go to the [[Add]] note.
