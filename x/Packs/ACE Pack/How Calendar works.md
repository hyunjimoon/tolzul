The Calendar is for things driven by time, like daily notes, records of key things, and reviews of one's trajectory in work and life.

The daily note is amazingly powerful. You can use it to plan and guide the day. Currently, I mostly use it for jotting down notes and ideas. The daily note is so important, it has one of the easiest hotkeys to type: `cmd-d` (or `ctrl-d`).

But I also believe in honoring my life by recording important moments or events as their own note. I do this a few ways. One way is to type: `cmd-p` (or `ctrl-p`) then `record` then the type of record you want to capture. My current favorites to capture as records are events, ideas, and meetings. 

Equally important is to have a place for deeper, longer-term reviews. When you're ready for another review (or existential crisis) go to [[Reviews]].

Go to [[Calendar]] for a truly powerful time-based view.

# Ways of Time-Traveling
Our ideas and experiences are wrapped up in a linear movement we call **Time**. It's a great way to organize and remember stuff. Here's how you can make Time work for you:

- ***Usefully***, you can track down old notes by Time, be reminded of distant memories, and even emotionally transport back to an echo of Past You.
- ***Practically***, you can rapidly capture an idea that sparks, quickly take meeting notes, and even log things you care about tracking.
- ***Creatively***, you can journal to get your thoughts out, or freewrite to get your mind unstuck.
- ***Productively***, you can plan your actions for the day, goals for the week, or even intentions for the yearâ€”and beyond.
- ***Reflectively***, you can review past notes, compile previous thoughts, and even synthesize old notes into new insights and consolidated wisdom.

Notes allow you to time travel. It's how Present You can receive messages from Past You and send messages to Future you. 

# Define your time-style
What's your time-style? I'm a more of a "monthly note" kind of person, but many people love their Daily Note workflow. I will still randomly capture sparks in a daily note, but I like to work from a monthly note.

In the [LYT Workshop](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/workshop), we go over:

- The "Daily Spark to Weekly Arc" workflow for Gardeners
- The "Monthly Map" workflow for Architects

But for now, you can just play around with the daily note:

- Open today's note by hitting `Cmd-d` (or `Ctrl-d` on Windows).

A daily note practice is great for many people. Try it out. Just never feel obligated to make a daily note every day. But do use them. Sometimes I log things on the fly like meetings, stuff I've watched, and notable workouts. Daily notes are great for a mixture of uses, such as: 

- planning your day
- jotting down ideas
- taking meeting notes
- reflecting on your day
