The "Areas" folder is for areas of effort. When an area of effort grows big enough, it starts to justify a folder to keep the random notes dedicated to it. Some areas of effort grow big enough to have their own area note dedicated to it as well. For example, like [[Area - Ideaverse Kits]]. 

Let's explore how this works.
