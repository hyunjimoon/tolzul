In PKM, there are three main headspaces (or "thinking orientations") to move between.

- Atlas for Knowledge-based thinking
- Calendar for Time-based thinking
- Efforts for Action-based thinking

You may find yourself completely immersed in a single headspace (a single folder), while completely neglecting the other two. You may even start to question if you need the other two folders.

Don’t worry, _**life is long and the pendulum will swing.**_

- You may be spending time in **Efforts** when...you find a new interest and wonder how to manage all the knowledge coming in.  
	- So it's time to shift to the **Atlas**.  ​

- You may be spending time in **Atlas** when...you start a new job and have to rapidly take a bunch of daily notes to make sense of later.  
	- So it's time to shift to **Calendar**.  
- ---
- You may be spending time in **Calendar** when...you have a good sense of your commitments in your new job and are ready to start managing things.  
	- So it's time to shift back to **Efforts**.

See how this is working?

ACE acknowledges and supports the 3 Headspaces of PKM.
