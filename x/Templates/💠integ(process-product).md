The [[üìùmoon25_mvt_gmt]] research aligns best with the Integrative Modeling (BPDE) quadrant because it combines mathematical decision frameworks with complete integration of belief systems and market dynamics. It transcends the other quadrants by formalizing relationships between different testing approaches rather than treating them as competing methodologies. This research represents mature entrepreneurial cognition capable of predicting outcomes under changing conditions while balancing internal decision processes with external market realities.

The framework organizes rationality along two dimensions: embodied vs. disembodied rationality (rows) and whether distribution changes through intervention (columns). This captures how rationality can be constructed either through symbolic manipulation or emergent capabilities, and whether the context involves static analysis or active intervention.

In the No Distribution Change column: The disembodied approach applies symbolic models to static conditions, exemplified by 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tenenbaum's "one and done" sampling strategies, 2Ô∏è‚É£ Gelman's iterative Bayesian model refinement, and 3Ô∏è‚É£ Moshe's discrete choice analysis of stable customer segments. The embodied cell is marked 'x', suggesting pure analysis without intervention may require some symbolic representation.

The Distribution Change column involves active interventions: The disembodied approach is represented by 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scott's stopping rule for entrepreneurial testing, using symbolic optimization for intervention decisions. The embodied cell shows how capabilities emerge through intervention, demonstrated by 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tushman's organizational learning to balance competing demands, 6Ô∏è‚É£ Teppo's theory of cognitive functions emerging through neural pathway reuse, 7Ô∏è‚É£ Szil√°rd's analysis of how information processing requires physical embodiment with inherent energy costs, and 8Ô∏è‚É£Charlie's view of capabilities evolving through practical experience.

- [[üìùüß≠Vectorizing Adaptation]] and [[üìùü§ùConversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] are two sides of one coin. The former fixes resource then optimizes business choices (supply chain and market), while the latter fixes business choices then optimize resource. In reality, optimization happens in the joint space of resource, supply chain, market, with the `capitalize`, `collaborate`, `segment`  process. We attribute the difficulty to play 3D game as our finite memory i.e. cognitive constraint.
#### 1 $\underset{ü§ú}{\rightarrow}$ 2 = 3 $\underset{ü§ú}{\rightarrow}$ 4
- From [[üìùüß≠Vectorizing Adaptation]] to [[üìùü™∂Sequential Evolutionary and Parallel Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] is addition of üëìjudge. This can help move [[üìùü§ùConversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] to [[üìùüå≥üåäStartup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]].
  
- [[üìùüå≥üåäStartup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]] relaxes cognitive constraint using program synthesis. This offers automated data modeling in a flexible manner, hence scalable.

 With stochastic world models evolving (hence non-stationary) across nail, scale, sail stage from [[üìùüå≥üåäStartup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]], we revisit the known conclusion [behavior of bayesian inference with finite memory emerges from evolution under non-stationary stochastic environments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422100821X)


#### üëìJudge
- evaluated by [[üó∫Ô∏èeval(1234üí†)]]
- Outlet: candidate journal that appreciates modeling + where I have access to evaluators for research-journal fit are logged in [segment: journal characteristics](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/255). Segmenting too early is costly so I didn‚Äôt add outlet for individual articles yet. Collaborators are also tentative as I didn‚Äôt get any commitment from my investors (except JB).

#### üß†Scientist
3. AB ‚Üí AEB based on my skill3 on meta cognition, with jb (artist) and charlie (judge), i'd like to imagine how evolution and bayesian can be synthesized (artist) on my model (scientist). this discovery can be then evaluated (judge)
4. AB ‚Üí ABD based on my skill2 on hierarchical bayesian, with jeff (artist) and teppo (judge). jeff and i would discover archetype of investors, and meaning of knowing this will be evaluated by judge
