| Component         | Description                                              | Tesla Cybertruck Marketing Optimization Context                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State (s)         | Current condition of the environment                     | Current market adoption, revenue potential, product specifications (range: 300 vs 350 miles), target market (urban vs rural) |
| Action (a)        | Possible decisions or strategies                         | Choose product specifications, select target market segment                                                                  |
| Environment (Env) | Models how actions and states interact                   | MarketAdoptionModel class, calculating adoption rates and revenue potential based on product-market fit                      |
| Utility (U)       | Quantifies desirability of outcomes                      | Market Adoption and Revenue Potential                                                                                        |
| Expectation (E[]) | Accounts for uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning | Consideration of adoption rates in different market segments, impact of range on customer preferences                        |
| Argmax            | Selection of action maximizing expected utility          | Choosing optimal product specifications and target market to maximize adoption and revenue                                   |
| act*              | Optimal action taken at each point in time               | Finalizing product specifications (range) and target market segment                                                          |

## 2. `collaborate` productization components

| Component | Description | Tesla Cybertruck Sourcing Optimization Context |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| State (s) | Current condition of the environment | Current production capacity, costs, quality levels, time to market |
| Action (a) | Possible decisions or strategies | Choose between in-house vs. outsourced production, local vs. global manufacturing |
| Environment (Env) | Models how actions and states interact | SupplyChainModel class, calculating production efficiency, costs, and time to market |
| Utility (U) | Quantifies desirability of outcomes | Probability of scaling before running out of funds |
| Expectation (E[]) | Accounts for uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning | Consideration of production risks, cost variations, and market demand fluctuations |
| Argmax | Selection of action maximizing expected utility | Choosing optimal sourcing strategy to maximize scaling probability |
| act* | Optimal action taken at each point in time | Finalizing sourcing decisions (in-house/outsource, local/global) |
