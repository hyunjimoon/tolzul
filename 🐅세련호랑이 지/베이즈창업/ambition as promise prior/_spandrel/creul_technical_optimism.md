## 핵심 통찰의 수식화

**Berlant의 Impasse = M3의 수학적 구현**

```
"productive suspension" ≈ Var[φ] = μ(1-μ)/(τ₀+1)

여기서:
- τ₀ 충분히 작음 → 너무 많은 불확실성 (무의미)
- τ₀ 충분히 큼 → 너무 많은 구체성 (잔혹)
- τ₀ ≈ 3-5 → "hum of the wires" (생산적 진동)
```

이 표는 Berlant의 철학적 통찰이 어떻게 당신의 수학 모델로 변환되는지 보여줍니다. M3가 "잔혹한 낙관주의"의 역설을 가장 잘 포착하는 이유도 명확해집니다.

Berlant의 '정동적 소진'이 제가 창업 과정에서 겪은 관계의 상실과 정확히 맞아떨어집니다
## 1. 학부생 수준 설명

### 한 문단

M3 모델에서 약속 수준(φ)이 고정된 값이 아니라 Beta 분포를 따르는 확률변수라는 점이 핵심입니다. Tesla가 "200마일 이상"이라고 말할 때, 이 "이상"이라는 모호함이 바로 잔혹한 낙관주의의 역설을 보여줍니다 - 충분히 구체적이어서 투자자들이 믿지만, 충분히 모호해서 실패해도 완전한 거짓말은 아닌 것이죠. M3는 이런 "생산적 모호함"을 Beta 분포의 분산으로 표현하여, 약속이 너무 명확하면 실패 시 치명적이고(Nikola), 너무 모호하면 아무도 안 믿는(초기 전기차) 딜레마를 수학적으로 포착합니다.

### 한 문장

M3는 약속을 확률분포로 모델링하여 "충분히 믿을만하지만 충분히 모호한" 최적 지점이 존재함을 보여줍니다.

## 2. 박사 수준 설명

### 한 문단

M3의 계층적 베이지안 구조는 Berlant가 지적한 "애착 대상의 이중성"을 Prior(μ,τ₀) → Likelihood(φ) → Posterior의 확률적 전파로 형식화합니다. 여기서 τ₀의 고정은 구조적 제약을 나타내며, φ의 확률적 본성은 약속의 수행성(performativity)과 지시성(referentiality) 사이의 존재론적 긴장을 포착합니다. 특히 P(s) = ∫φ(1-φ)ⁿ·Beta(φ;μτ₀,(1-μ)τ₀)dφ에서 적분은 단순한 기댓값이 아니라 "가능성의 공간"에 대한 주변화(marginalization)로서, 이는 Berlant의 "impasse"를 확률측도 공간에서의 ergodic 상태로 재해석하게 합니다.

### 한 문장

M3는 약속의 지시적 내용과 수행적 효과 사이의 변증법적 긴장을 Beta-Binomial 켤레성(conjugacy)의 폐쇄형 주변우도(closed-form marginal likelihood)로 포착하여, 잔혹한 낙관주의를 최적 제어 문제가 아닌 확률적 평형(stochastic equilibrium)으로 재구성합니다.

- entrepreneurial subjectivity

> George Bush I saying, “A thousand points of light.” The idea of a volunteer society became so important in the United States, and that's incredibly depressing. The idea that everybody who's generating value and reproducing life shouldn't be able to survive, and more than survive. One of the things that happens in this model of entrepreneurial subjectivity is that survival looks like the best possible horizon of living.
> 
> It was also people who thought that there was still a chance for there to be a genuinely redistributive administration. And then of course it turned out that he had drunk the neoliberal Kool-Aid when he was at the University of Chicago and he really did believe in entrepreneurial subjectivity and people responsible-ising upward mobility. 

교수님 귀찮게 해드리고 싶지 않았는데, Berlant교수님은 귀찮게할 수 없어 (2021년 작고) 한 여름의 궁금증을,오늘에서야 여쭙니다.

첫 메일

제목: [문학과 정신분석] 2024-2 Cruel Optimism 강의자료 요청

안녕하세요 김정하 교수님,

MIT 박사과정생 문현지입니다. 창업 생태계에서 약속의 구조를 연구하고 있습니다.

교수님께서 2024년 2학기 11주차(11/12, 11/14)에 다루신 Lauren Berlant의 
Cruel Optimism 강의자료를 요청드리고자 연락드립니다.

제 연구는 창업자들이 과도한 정밀도의 약속으로 스스로 학습 능력을 
차단하는 현상을 다룹니다. 시장 신호를 무시하게 되는 이 구조적 경직성이 
Berlant의 "promise of the promise" 개념과 깊이 연결된다고 생각합니다.

교수님 강의자료를 통해 다음을 탐구하려 합니다:
- 약속이 exchange value로만 작동할 때의 정동적 고착
- "Expertise vacuum"에서 협력하는 주체들의 상호 환상
- Verification cost 없이 만들어진 정밀도의 숨겨진 부채

혹시 관련 강의 슬라이드나 읽기자료 목록을 공유해주실 수 있을까요?

감사합니다.
문현지 올림

- [[harbermas]]' "inheritance becomes the promise of the promise, of a technical optimism; it sutures them both to life lived without risk" Looking at these interconnected texts, I can trace a fascinating theoretical lineage around promises, technical systems, and hidden costs.

[[andrew(bayesian cringe)]]


##  1. "Technical" in Berlant's "Technical Optimism"

In "Exchange Value," when Berlant writes about "the promise of the promise, of a technical optimism," the word "technical" carries specific critical theory weight. The inheritance transforms into pure exchange potential - not promising specific satisfactions but promising the eternal availability of promising itself. "Technical" here evokes:

- **Instrumental rationality** (Frankfurt School tradition) - where human relations become reduced to procedures and calculations
- **Formal/procedural logic** - divorced from substantive human needs
- **Systematic/mechanical** - operating according to its own internal logic rather than human purposes

The reference likely draws from critical theory's longstanding critique of technical rationality (Habermas, Marcuse) where "technical" denotes systems that operate according to their own logic, independent of human flourishing.

----- 
## 2. The Self-Referential "Promise of Promise"

This recursive structure - a promise that promises only the ability to continue promising - creates what systems theorists would call a "strange loop." In Berlant's story, the inheritance doesn't promise specific goods but rather infinite potential for exchange. This self-referentiality:

- Creates a closed system that refers only to itself
- Generates a trap where the maintenance of potential becomes the sole activity
- Parallels what Luhmann called "autopoietic systems" - systems that produce their own reproduction

The concept extends to any system where the ⭐️meta-level operation (maintaining the ability to operate) consumes the system's actual purpose.⭐️

---

## 3. Hidden Technical Debt as Promise Pathology

Sculley et al.'s "hidden technical debt" maps perfectly onto this framework. ML systems create their own version of cruel optimism:

- **The initial promise**: Quick deployment, improved accuracy, automated decisions
- **The meta-promise**: Maintaining these promises requires exponentially growing maintenance costs
- **The trap**: Systems become frozen by their own complexity, where maintaining the promise prevents delivering on it

Like Berlant's characters who can't spend their wealth, ML systems accumulate debt that prevents the very improvements they were meant to enable.

can't do what they were meant to do (e.g. 창업의 본질 - 가치설득, 창출, 측정가능한건 본질이 아니다. )

----

## 4. Information Cost and Entrepreneurial Feedback Loops

The entrepreneurial promise paper's "verification cost" represents the price of transforming vague potential into specific commitments. Connecting this to the operations for entrepreneurs framework:

### Feedback Cost Structure:

1. **7→4 (Replicate to Evaluate)**: High cost because replication attempts reveal which promises were actually verifiable vs. which were "technical optimism"
2. **4→3 (Evaluate to Professionalize)**: Medium cost as evaluation forces codification of previously implicit promises
3. **4→1 (Evaluate to Acculturate)**: Highest cost because it requires admitting the gap between promised and delivered

### Rational Meaning Construction (RMC) Cost:

The RMC cost represents the entrepreneurial equivalent of Berlant's "technical optimism" - the cost of maintaining coherent meaning when experience contradicts promises. As ventures replicate, they discover their promises were "promises of promises" rather than substantive commitments. The RMC cost is the price of:

- Reconciling aspirational promises with operational reality
- Maintaining stakeholder belief despite evidence
- Constructing narratives that preserve the promise structure even as specific promises fail

## 5. Synthesis: The Architecture of Deferred Satisfaction

All four texts converge on a critical insight: modern systems (whether emotional, technical, or entrepreneurial) increasingly operate through promises about promises rather than direct satisfaction. The "technical" in technical optimism, technical debt, and technical precision all point to the same phenomenon - systems that maintain themselves through perpetual deferral.

This creates a specific pathology where:

- Success is measured by ability to continue rather than ability to deliver
- Precision becomes a cost rather than a virtue
- Feedback loops consume more resources than primary operations
- The promise structure itself becomes the product

The entrepreneurial framework's "overpromise: replicate what's right" captures this perfectly - replication isn't about copying success but about reproducing the promise structure that enables continued operation despite non-delivery.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular connection between these concepts? The relationship between verification cost and technical debt seems particularly rich for further exploration.

"기술 부채는 **소프트웨어 개발 시 빠른 마감을 위해 최적의 방법 대신 임시방편적이고 쉬운 솔루션을 선택함으로써 발생하는 추가적인 재작업 비용"이라는 정의 중* undeclared consumer
# Undeclared Consumers.
Oftentimes, a prediction from a machine learning model mais made widely accessible, either at runtime or by writing to files or logs that may later be consumed by other systems. Without access controls, some of these consumers may be undeclared, silently using the output of a given model as an input to another system. In more classical software engineering, these issues are referred to as visibility debt [13].
Undeclared consumers are expensive at best and dangerous at worst, because they create a hidden tight coupling of model mato other parts of the stack. Changes to mawill very likely impact these other parts, potentially in ways that are unintended, poorly understood, and detrimental. In practice, this tight coupling can radically increase the cost and difficulty of making any changes to maat all, even if they are improvements. Furthermore, undeclared consumers may create hidden feedback loops, which are described more in detail in section 4.
2 Undeclared consumers may be difficult to detect unless the system is specifically designed to guard against this case, for example with access restrictions or strict service-level agreements (SLAs). In the absence of barriers, engineers will naturally use the most convenient signal at hand, especially when working against deadline pressures.

## The double bind as a driver of evolution

After many years of research into schizophrenia, Bateson continued to explore problems of communication and learning, first with dolphins, and then with the more abstract processes of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"). Bateson emphasized that any communicative system characterized by different logical levels might be subject to double bind problems. Especially including the communication of characteristics from one generation to another (genetics and evolution).

> Evolution always followed the pathways of viability. As Lewis Carroll has pointed out, the theory [of natural selection] explains quite satisfactorily why there are no bread-and-butter-flies today."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind#cite_note-9)

Bateson used the fictional Bread and Butter Fly (from _[Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass "Through the Looking-Glass")_) to illustrate the double bind in terms of natural selection. The gnat points out that the insect would be doomed if he found his food (which would dissolve his own head, since this insect's head is made of sugar, and his only food is tea), and starve if he did not. Alice suggests that this must happen quite often, to which the gnat replies: "It always happens."

The pressures that drive evolution therefore represent a genuine double bind. And there is truly no escape: "It always happens." No species can escape natural selection, including our own.

Bateson suggested that all evolution is driven by the double bind, whenever circumstances change: If any environment becomes toxic to any species, that species will die out unless it transforms into another species, in which case, the species becomes extinct anyway.

Most significant here is Bateson's exploration of what he later came to call "the pattern that connects"[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind#cite_note-10)—that problems of communication which span more than one level (e.g., the relationship between the individual and the family) should also be expected to be found spanning other pairs of levels in the hierarchy (e.g. the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype):

> We are very far … from being able to pose specific questions for the geneticist; but I believe that the wider implications of what I have been saying modify somewhat the philosophy of genetics. Our approach to the problems of schizophrenia by way of a theory of levels or logical types has disclosed first that the problems of adaptation and learning and their pathologies must be considered in terms of a ⭐️hierarchic system in which stochastic change occurs at the boundary points between the segments of the hierarchy⭐️. 
> 
> We have considered three such regions of stochastic change—the level of genetic mutation, the level of learning (??), and the level of change in family organization. 
> 
> We have disclosed the possibility of a relationship of these levels which orthodox genetics would deny, and we have disclosed that at least in human societies the evolutionary system consists not merely in the selective survival of those persons who happen to select appropriate environments but also in the modification of family environment in a direction which might enhance the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the individual members.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind#cite_note-11)

### Positive double binds

Bateson also described positive double binds, both in relation to [Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Buddhism "Zen Buddhism") with its path of spiritual growth, and the use of therapeutic double binds by psychiatrists to confront their patients with the contradictions in their life in such a way that would help them heal. One of Bateson's consultants, [Milton H. Erickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson "Milton H. Erickson") (5 volumes, edited by Rossi) eloquently demonstrated the productive possibilities of double binds through his own life, showing the technique in a brighter light.[_[more detail needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Explanationism "Wikipedia:Explanationism")_]
