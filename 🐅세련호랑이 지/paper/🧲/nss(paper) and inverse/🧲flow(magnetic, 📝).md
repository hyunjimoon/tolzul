# Simple Magnetic-Flow Guide for Academic Paper Structure

Use this **magnetic-field analogy** to teach college students how to structure a paper using our D–G–D model. Think of 🟪 (Alert) as the **North pole** at the top, 🟥 (Conclusion) as the **South pole** at the bottom, and six alternating 🟩/🟧 “flows” in between.

---

## 1. Poles of the Paper

- 🟪 **North (Alert):** What problem are we warning about?
    
- 🟥 **South (Conclusion):** What main contributions do we deliver?
    

---

## 2. Six Magnetic Flows

Below are the **six flows** (three horizontal, three vertical). Each flow alternates 🟩→🟧→🟩.

### A. Horizontal Flows (Across the Paper)

1. **Flow A:** 🟩 Describe past need → 🟧 Show solution growth → 🟩 Point to future need
    
2. **Flow B:** 🟩 Describe another past need → 🟧 Show solution growth → 🟩 Point to future need
    
3. **Flow C:** 🟩 Describe third past need → 🟧 Show solution growth → 🟩 Point to future need
    

### B. Vertical Flows (Down the Paper)

1. **Left Pillar:** 🟩 Need 1 → 🟩 Need 2 → 🟩 Need 3
    
2. **Center Pillar:** 🟧 Growth 1 → 🟧 Growth 2 → 🟧 Growth 3
    
3. **Right Pillar:** 🟩 Future-need 1 → 🟩 Future-need 2 → 🟩 Future-need 3

## 3. How to Use in Teaching

1. **Map each section** of your paper to one of these flows.
    
2. **Ensure alternation**: each pair of points within a flow should switch color (🟩→🟧→🟩).
    
3. **Visualize** by drawing arrows: horizontal arrows for row flows, vertical arrows for column flows.
    

This simple guide helps students see the six paths—three left‑to‑right and three top‑to‑bottom—that link the problem alert to the final conclusion in a balanced, magnetic‑flow structure.

## 4. Example: STRAP1 (Push–Pull) Case Study

Using the _STRAP1 (PushPull)_ paper, we can illustrate each of the six flows with real labels from that document fileciteturn2file0:

### 4.1 Horizontal Flows

- **Flow A (Past → Grow → Future):**
    
    - 🟩 **D5:** need to predict stakeholder commitment
        
    - 🟧 **G15:** commitments are quality‑nonlinear & asymmetric
        
    - 🟩 **D23:** need to control clockspeed
        
- **Flow B (Past → Grow → Future):**
    
    - 🟩 **D3:** need to prioritize stakeholder
        
    - 🟧 **G13:** commitments are quality‑nonlinear
        
    - 🟩 **D25:** need to infer control βᵣ,β𝑐
        
- **Flow C (Past → Grow → Future):**
    
    - 🟩 **D7:** need to optimize quality given predicted commitments
        
    - 🟧 **G11:** optimize quality given stakeholders (linear)
        
    - 🟩 **D27:** need to jointly optimize quality & stakeholders
        

### 4.2 Vertical Flows

- **Left Pillar:** D5 → D3 → D7
    
- **Center Pillar:** G15 → G13 → G11
    
- **Right Pillar:** D23 → D25 → D27
    

_Students can refer to the labeled equations in STRAP1 (e.g., P_r(q)=rac{e^{-β_r q}}{1+e^{-β_r q}} in G15) to see exactly how each flow maps to that case._
