> [!rainbow] ARC Â» [[Add]] | [[Relate]] | **[[Communicate]]** 

If you are getting lost or wondering "what's the point" you need to fast-forward to the **communicate** step and immediately find a way to share your thoughts. If your motivation is lagging, it's usually because there is nothing at the end of ARC to pull the ideas forward. Is this something for work? Is this something you can share with family, friends, or the internet at large? At the very least, challenge yourself to email a sharable draft to yourself. 

To track your shared expressions and communications, go to [[Works]].
