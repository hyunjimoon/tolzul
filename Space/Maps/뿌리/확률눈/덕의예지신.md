내면이 깊은 것 같은 신비로운 느낌 (아우라)는 어떻게 오는 걸까라고 [[박경린]]에게 물으니 (내가 경린이를 그렇게 느꼈으므로), "끊임없는 고민이 누적되어 고유한 분위기를 형성", "삶에 대한 태도가 세월 속에 무르익어 나타나는 미학"이라 설명해줬다. [[조수용조수용]]

### Deok (德) = In (仁) × Ui (義) × Ye (禮) × Ji (智) × Shin (信)

**Virtue = Benevolence × Righteousness × Propriety × Wisdom × Trust**

The effectiveness of leadership depends more on _who_ is speaking than on _what_ is said. This emphasizes that a leader must themselves possess the necessary qualities. In Confucianism, these are expressed as the Five Constants (仁, 義, 禮, 智, 信), and their relationship is described as a product: Deok (德) = In (仁) × Ui (義) × Ye (禮) × Ji (智) × Shin (信).

1. Deok (德) - Virtue

Confucius said that governing by virtue is like the North Star, which remains in its place while all the other stars turn towards it. When leadership is exercised through virtue, people are edified without the leader needing to act, they trust without the leader needing to speak, and things are accomplished without the leader needing to do anything. In this way, troubles can be resolved from a state of stillness. In essence: "If you lead by laws and punishments, the people will try to avoid them, but they will have no sense of shame. If you lead them by virtue and propriety, they will have a sense of shame and become good."

2. In (仁) - Benevolence

The character for In (仁) combines "person" (人) and "two" (二), signifying that the relationship between people is its foundation. It answers the question, "Is being human enough to be called human? One must be humane to be truly human." That which makes a person humane is In (仁). In English, it is often translated as "humanity," as it signifies humaneness. The more sensitive a leader is to the pain of others and their team members, feeling it as their own, the larger their capacity as a leader becomes.

3. Ui (義) - Righteousness

A requisite for a leader is the balance between Benevolence (仁) and Righteousness (義). After showing empathy through In (仁), a leader must also demonstrate strict fairness through Ui (義). Righteousness without benevolence creates a culture of fear, while benevolence without righteousness creates a weak and undisciplined organization. It is righteousness that sets the standards and symbols for what is and is not acceptable in an organizational culture. In English, Ui (義) corresponds to "justice," meaning "neither more nor less, but exactly right."

4. Ye (禮) - Propriety

The etymology of Ye (禮) comes from presenting offerings in abundance to express one's heart. It is the formal expression of one's sincerity to the divine. As such, Ye (禮) is the summation of form and substance. Its meaning is close to "manners" in English. If etiquette is the form of consciousness (儀識), manners are the state of consciousness (意識). If etiquette is a manual, manners are the mindset of respecting the other person.

5. Ji (智) - Wisdom

This character implies that true knowing deepens with the accumulation of time and experience. If 知 is knowledge, then 智 is embodied wisdom. Whether by gathering the opinions of others or through deepening reflection over time, wisdom is matured knowledge. While knowledge stops at merely knowing, wisdom is a higher stage where that knowledge is internalized and advanced. If knowledge is inscribed on a clay tablet, wisdom is taking a step further to add one's own perspective. If knowledge is knowledge, wisdom is wisdom. The fact that "wisdom" and "wit" share the same root indicates that both humor and wisdom are only possible when based on seeing and knowing.

6. Shin (信) - Trust

A person's words must align perfectly with their previous words and actions to be trustworthy. In the art of war, it is said that one should use deception when fighting the enemy, but rely on trust when leading one's own troops. Confucius compared leadership without trust to a cart without a yoke; it is like a car without a steering wheel. A leader who cannot earn trust can accomplish nothing. A person of character first earns trust before administering the affairs of the state; if they try to govern without trust, the people will feel oppressed. They first earn the trust of their superiors before offering counsel; if they offer blunt advice without trust, their superiors will feel slandered. The etymology of the English word "trust" is derived from a sense of comfort (_Angie: trust might be relevant with Tree or Truth_). Trust is that which allows one to feel at ease when believing, following, and entrusting.
