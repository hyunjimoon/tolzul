I'm a Ph.D. at MIT studying innovation and operations management with [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/),  [Scott Stern](https://www.scott-stern.com/), [Vikash Mansinghka](https://probcomp-test211190.csail.mit.edu/talks/). My past and future in [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fa14fcd5ihdq014k6v4h0/Angie-Moon-Resume.pdf?rlkey=y7eerk8e6yx028es2rq7vjmid&dl=0). 

I use probability, statistics, optimization theory to model entrepreneurial decision making. My main tool is probabilistic program. 

My vision is one venture per person. User innovation where use value is translated to exchange value. Utopian society where every one consumes each other's identify and acts to live an ergodic life. That's my [[🔴sun]] and surprise surprise, I'm the guinea pig.
