commercial drone market is growing fast (few settings where robotics meet real world; much faster than AV;  open-ended than warehouse ; real system than home robotics); thermal sensors (rescue, conservation, but have some worries) - weather like fog is uncertainty make

rejuvanation - widening the (trigger in larger hypo space) than my motion prior would suggest ![[Pasted image 20230822131643.png]]

can trace (record of every stoch choice made)

lager range scanner (construct one by computation, classical motion sensor - vision)
noisy sensors are roatating and uniforming sample from interval (by taking actual disctace from wall and adding randomness)

where robots were trying to go, not where it actually went

gen trace are (index of angle - key for distance
![[Pasted image 20230822133416.png]])
glue the sensor and (curly mode is defining initial) - sequence of pose in sensor readings

motion model ()
![[Pasted image 20230822133602.png]]
each choice is latent variable in probability model
because of taking out of concrete object in code (stochastic choices) - include deep learning ecology (because of modularity - infernce meta program)
able to scale logic that mathematics, robotics couldn't do (10 billion codes); mathematical objects
trace data structure 
![[Pasted image 20230822133532.png]]
only give idea (Q. Doesn't tell how to find it?)
![[Pasted image 20230822134045.png]]

Another big idea in gen (inf meta prog)

made it possible to use all that are seen as alternatives (inf lib for diff methods and its combination - even transformers and diffusion model's engine)![[Pasted image 20230822134228.png]]

simulating generative execution (update trace with small change and calculate = post-updating, evaluating gradients of score); incremental computation (efficiency updating output)
![[Pasted image 20230822134338.png]]

most scalable; evolving set of traces (updating them and how they fit locally, and get credit for those via weights (how close it to the actual posterior))
![[Pasted image 20230822134501.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230822134710.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230822134809.png]]
generate bunch of traces along with the trace and likelihood of any contstraints from the data (data via observation pass into `generate` ; partial trace which stores - can exact (rejection sample - much closer)
![[Pasted image 20230822135007.png]]
for shorter path, SIRI and rejection sampling workes well but
![[Pasted image 20230822135044.png]]
iterate over steps (reset weights at each time, for each particles, improve the particle by using stoch choice as if to perturb via gaussian centered on current trace - wiggle around) - design space of 

![[Pasted image 20230822135115.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230822135233.png]]
genjax (likelihood and hierarchical extension - don't give good output for clutter)
in graduate level, we learn how each SIRI, MCMC rej are instances of much larger algorithm

addd in inference hings (data driven ) - let users specific hints (subproblem being ) - parameterize meta inference ; reconfigurable by end users (cusomized template)
![[Pasted image 20230822140014.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230822140135.png]]
- as worse as RL lol
data driven works much better 
![[Pasted image 20230822140201.png]]
compiles substructure (use exact inf algo tosolve problems)  - coupling ?? and ?? which is most 
![[Pasted image 20230822140225.png]]

two paths (forward) = working on the highltithted (blue rows - link - reconsidering in light of that context - to improve to fix mistakes)

- mutually help you (choose what variables to block over - mini batch (but have analogy))

translate to discrete subproblem exactly
- top down (high accuracy that take account of current state)
- amortized (gen sim data from model and train nn treating all the latent var as labels; actual posterior of label - no gap)
- fast and modular (exact - for the parts of the problem that's affected); expoit ; wouldn't explore whole palce but explot gen model is symbolic and proceed or invalidate given new data 
- instead generate a label data than do (principles are superset of ; can use amortized in submodule)

- pclean is not only for data cleaning (massive spread of disimforable - confabulation from ; humand and machine generated confabulation)

![[Pasted image 20230822140924.png]]

ground truth, combined with smc (score unstructure text in terms of  - filter llm - check inclaims againt pclean)- making a factual claim if it a factural than what is the fact set that supports

possible to build, test design for immune system (claims and facuality and language model - audit trail - ppl make prob listic judgement)

- type of prob. (symbolic representation) - neural generative models

immune system (operate probablistically - no answer in ) - fundamental escape from immune ; risk award tradeoff - 
societal scale (additional what rights should be; shallow parts  consumption of speech - virally )

alternative to social media unregulative (genAI) - enormaous partnership btw government (painful for industry (facutality)- )
work towards step ; parse text how poetnetial factual it is (ind) then you can see what's the evidence of facts (entity that googles use ; structure boxes (that have lots of facts in it) pcleasns to )

very hard smart entrep (legal and ) - catalyze political will

outlier을 배제하는게 목적, 벽상자서 반사된게 들어오는게

센서모델에 대해 얼마나 가능한 데이터가 나오는지 (outlier면 비율이 낮게 나옴 - importance sampling했을때 - 가능도가 희박)

- is it better to have more outlier (or not)

함수를 function_cache (함수를 불렀을때 값을 캐시화)

instruction, 함수값도 캐시화 (cpu구조적으로 불가 , byte code interpreter - cpu는 파이썬의 실행파일을 캐시)
lru_cache는 vm 

cpu에서 실행되는 어셈블리어 (cpu)

Y를 가지고 와서, 센서모수를 확인해야 (추론), X뽑을수 잇음 (보정된 센서값; Y가 주어졌을때 X, sigma추론) - pose추론 (보정된 센서로 pose추론)
