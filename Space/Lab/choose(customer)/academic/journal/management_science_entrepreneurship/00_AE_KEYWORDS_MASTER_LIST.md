## PAPER POSITIONING STRATEGY

### Core Theoretical Contribution:
"We bridge **Bayesian entrepreneurial finance** (Nanda 2024) with **strategic ambiguity** theory to explain heterogeneous venture outcomes"

### Key Positioning Points:

**For Ramana Nanda:**
- "Extends your Bayesian persuasion framework to promise precision (τ)"
- "Shows how entrepreneurs strategically manage priors through ambiguity"
- "Provides micro-foundations for multi-stage learning dynamics"

**For Michael Ewens:**
- "Explains variation in VC contracts through promise precision"
- "Shows matching implications: vague promises attract patient capital"
- "Contract terms reflect optimal response to promise ambiguity"

**For Tristan Botelho:**
- "Evaluation criteria systematically vary with promise precision"
- "Early-stage evaluators prefer vague promises (optionality)"
- "Later-stage evaluators prefer precise promises (execution)"

**For Rembrand Koning:**
- "Strategic experimentation through promise design"
- "Field experiment methodology applicable to promise precision"
- "Connects to A/B testing literature on organizational learning"

---

## THEORETICAL BRIDGES TO BUILD

### Connection to Ramana Nanda's Work:
- **Priors**: μ₀ (initial aspiration level) = investor's prior belief
- **Experiments**: Early funding rounds = experiments that update beliefs
- **Persuasion**: Entrepreneur's promise precision (τ) is persuasion strategy
- **Financing Frictions**: High τ → immediate evaluation, Low τ → delayed evaluation

### Your Unique Contribution:
**"Optimal Ignorance Level" (OIL) framework**: τ* = max{0, √(V/4i) - 1}

This is NOVEL because existing literature assumes:
- Ramana: Entrepreneurs want to maximize information revelation
- Ewens: Contracts address agency problems
- Koning: Experimentation reduces uncertainty

**You show**: Sometimes MORE ambiguity is optimal (strategic ignorance)

---

## LITERATURE GAPS YOUR PAPER FILLS

1. **Bayesian Entrepreneurship** (Nanda):
   - Existing: How investors update beliefs
   - **Gap**: How entrepreneurs strategically manage what investors update ON
   - **Your contribution**: Promise precision as strategic choice variable

2. **VC Contracts** (Ewens, Rhodes-Kropf):
   - Existing: How contracts allocate control rights
   - **Gap**: Why some ventures get different contract structures
   - **Your contribution**: Promise ambiguity explains contract heterogeneity

3. **Evaluation Processes** (Botelho):
   - Existing: How evaluators assess ventures
   - **Gap**: Why same venture evaluated differently over time
   - **Your contribution**: Promise precision evolution explains this

4. **Experimentation** (Koning, Hasan):
   - Existing: Learning through doing/testing
   - **Gap**: Strategic control of what's learned
   - **Your contribution**: Entrepreneurs control learning pace via promise design

---

## EMPIRICAL POSITIONING

### Your Dataset Advantage:
- **Crunchbase**: Promise text analysis (NLP for vagueness metrics)
- **PitchBook**: Funding round structure
- **SEC Filings**: Outcome measures

### Hypotheses Aligned with Each Editor:

**H1 (Nanda)**: Vague promises → Lower initial funding but higher option value
**H2 (Ewens)**: Promise precision predicts VC contract structure  
**H3 (Botelho)**: Evaluation criteria severity increases with promise precision
**H4 (Koning)**: Ventures experiment more when promises are vague
**H5 (Guzman)**: Vague early promises → higher variance in outcomes

---

## SUBMISSION TIMELINE STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Primary Submission (Month 1-2)
→ **Submit to Ramana Nanda** at Management Science
- Cover letter emphasizes Bayesian framework
- Position as "extending your 2024 work to promise design"

### Phase 2: Conference Presentations (Month 3-6)
- NBER Entrepreneurship (Nanda, Ewens)  
- AOM Technology & Innovation Management (Koning)
- Strategy Science Conference (Guzman)
→ Get feedback, build visibility

### Phase 3: Parallel Strategy (Month 7+)
If R&R from Nanda: Revise aggressively
If Reject: Pivot to Ewens or Koning with re-positioning

## RISKS & MITIGATION

**Risk 1**: "Too theoretical for empirical journal"
- **Mitigation**: Lead with HE and HL hypotheses (empirical results)
- Keep OIL framework as **"theoretical mechanism"** section
- Charlie's structural approach validates this

**Risk 2**: "Ambiguity not same as strategic choice"
- **Mitigation**: Cite Einhorn & Hogarth (1985) on ambiguity as strategy
- Show entrepreneurs choose τ, not that they're confused

**Risk 3**: "Sample selection - only VC-backed ventures"
- **Mitigation**: This is a FEATURE not bug (most relevant setting)
- Acknowledge boundary conditions explicitly
