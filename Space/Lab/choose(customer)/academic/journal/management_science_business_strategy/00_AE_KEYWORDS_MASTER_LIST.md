# Management Science - Business Strategy Department
## Associate Editors Research Keywords Master List (2025)

**Mission Context**: Identifying optimal target editors for "Promise Precision and Venture Funding" paper
**Strategic Assessment**: Business Strategy editors vs. E&I editors for Bayesian entrepreneurship work

---

## CRITICAL STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT 🚨

### **Key Finding**: Business Strategy dept has WEAKER fit than E&I dept

**Reasoning**:
1. **E&I dept** has dedicated entrepreneurial finance scholars (Ramana Nanda, Michael Ewens)
2. **Business Strategy dept** focuses more on:
   - Organizational economics (contracts, incentives)
   - IP/innovation strategy
   - Labor markets
   - Firm strategy & competition
3. **Your paper** = Bayesian entrepreneurial finance → BETTER fit for E&I

**Recommendation**: **PRIMARY submission should remain with E&I dept (Ramana Nanda)**
**Secondary use**: Business Strategy editors as backup if E&I rejects

---

## TIER 1: MODERATE RELEVANCE - Contracts & Organizational Economics

### 1. **Robert Gibbons** (MIT) 🎯
**PARTIAL ALIGNMENT** - Relational contracts & organizational economics expert
- **Relational contracts** (informal agreements, trust-based)
- Organizational design & performance
- Incentive contracts & agency theory
- Rules vs. principles in contracts
- Formal vs. relational governance
- Principal-agent models
- Multi-task incentive problems
- Organizational culture & adaptation
**Relevance**: Promise ambiguity could be framed as relational contract design
**Connection**: How vague promises create relational (vs. formal) contracts
**Weakness**: Not focused on entrepreneurship/VC specifically

### 2. **Christopher Stanton** (Harvard)
- Personnel economics & organizational economics
- **Founder-CEO compensation** (with Ramana Nanda, Michael Ewens)
- Entrepreneurship & VC-backed ventures
- Labor markets & gig economy
- Remote work & future of work
- Digital labor platforms
- Self-employment dynamics
**Relevance**: Founder compensation connects to promise-based contracts
**Connection**: How promise precision affects founder incentive structures
**Weakness**: More labor/personnel focus than strategic choice

### 3. **Hong Luo** (Harvard/Toronto)
- Innovation strategy & IP management
- Market for ideas & technology transfer
- Patent strategy & disclosure
- Tort liability & innovation
- Healthcare innovation
- Legal regimes impact on innovation
**Relevance**: Information disclosure strategies in innovation
**Connection**: Strategic information disclosure = strategic ambiguity
**Weakness**: More IP/legal focus than entrepreneurial finance

## STRATEGIC POSITIONING FOR BUSINESS STRATEGY DEPT

### IF Submitting to Business Strategy (Not Recommended as Primary):

**Best Fit: Robert Gibbons** (but still weaker than Ramana Nanda)

**Positioning Angle**:
- Frame paper as "**Relational Contract Design in Entrepreneurship**"
- Emphasis: How promise ambiguity creates **trust-based (relational)** vs. **performance-based (formal)** contracts
- Your τ* formula = optimal balance between formal/relational contracting

**Key Arguments for Gibbons**:
1. Vague promises → relational contracts (trust, long-term relationship)
2. Precise promises → formal contracts (measurable milestones, control rights)
3. OIL framework explains WHEN relational contracts dominate

**Theoretical Connection**:
- Baker, Gibbons, Murphy (2002): Relational contracts theory
- **Your contribution**: Entrepreneurs strategically choose contract TYPE through promise design
- τ↓ (vague) → More relational governance
- τ↑ (precise) → More formal governance

### Secondary Fit: Christopher Stanton

**Positioning Angle**:
- Frame as "**Founder Compensation & Promise-Based Incentives**"
- Connect to his work with Ramana Nanda on founder-CEO compensation

**Key Arguments**:
1. Promise precision affects founder equity/cash split
2. Vague promises → more equity-heavy compensation (option value)
3. Precise promises → more cash compensation (execution value)

### Tertiary Fit: Hong Luo

**Positioning Angle**:
- Frame as "**Strategic Information Disclosure in Innovation Markets**"
- Connect to her work on IP disclosure and market for ideas

**Key Arguments**:
1. Promise = information disclosure about innovation
2. Strategic ambiguity = optimal disclosure strategy
3. Entrepreneurs manage what they reveal to investors

---

## RECOMMENDED SUBMISSION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: PRIMARY SUBMISSION** (Months 1-3)
→ **Submit to Ramana Nanda (E&I dept)**
- Perfect theoretical fit (Bayesian entrepreneurship)
- Direct empirical relevance (VC funding)
- Recent 2024 paper on same topic

### **Phase 2: CONFERENCE VALIDATION** (Months 3-6)
→ Present at relevant conferences:
- NBER Entrepreneurship (Nanda, Ewens, Koning)
- AOM TIM (E&I focus)
- Academy of Management (Strategy division)

### **Phase 3: BACKUP STRATEGY** (Months 7+)

**IF E&I Rejects:**

**Option A: Pivot to Business Strategy (Robert Gibbons)**
- Reframe as relational contracts paper
- Emphasize organizational economics angle
- De-emphasize Bayesian finance, emphasize contract design

**Option B: Try Strategic Management Journal**
- Different journal, strategy focus
- Editors like Conti, Singh might be more receptive

**Option C: Try Organization Science**
- Organizational theory angle
- Gibbons is also active there

## WHY BUSINESS STRATEGY IS WEAKER FIT

### 1. **Theoretical Mismatch**
- Business Strategy = contracts, organizational economics, competitive strategy
- Your paper = Bayesian learning, entrepreneurial finance, VC funding
- **Gap**: Promise precision is about LEARNING not just CONTRACTING

### 2. **Empirical Context Mismatch**  
- Business Strategy editors study: established firms, employment contracts, market competition
- Your paper studies: early-stage ventures, VC funding, entrepreneur-investor dynamics
- **Gap**: Different organizational context and data requirements

### 3. **Methodological Mismatch**
- Business Strategy: Game theory, contract theory, industrial organization
- Your paper: Bayesian updating, option value theory, structural estimation
- **Gap**: Different modeling traditions

### 4. **Audience Mismatch**
- Business Strategy readers: Org economists, strategy scholars, IO economists
- Your paper's audience: Entrepreneurship scholars, finance scholars, VC practitioners
- **Gap**: Different academic communities

---

## IF YOU MUST USE BUSINESS STRATEGY

### Best Case Scenario: Position as "Hybrid" Paper

**Title**: "Relational Contracts Under Uncertainty: Strategic Promise Design in Entrepreneurial Finance"

**Abstract Reframe**:
- Lead with: "How do entrepreneurs design promises to optimize investor relationships?"
- Emphasize: Relational vs. formal governance trade-off
- De-emphasize: Bayesian learning and updating
- Frame τ* as "optimal relationship specificity" not "optimal ignorance"

**Theoretical Contribution** (for Gibbons):
1. Extends Baker-Gibbons-Murphy relational contracts to entrepreneurship setting
2. Shows how promise specificity affects contract enforceability
3. Demonstrates when relational governance dominates formal governance

**Empirical Contribution**:
1. Novel measure of promise vagueness in VC context
2. Shows relationship between promise specificity and contract terms
3. Evidence that vague promises → more relational governance

## CRITICAL WARNINGS ⚠️

### **Don't Do This**:
1. ❌ Submit to Business Strategy as first choice
2. ❌ Reframe paper too much (loses core contribution)  
3. ❌ Try to fit square peg in round hole
4. ❌ Ignore the perfect fit with Ramana Nanda

### **Do This Instead**:
1. ✅ Keep Ramana Nanda as primary target
2. ✅ Use Business Strategy only as backup
3. ✅ If rejected from E&I, THEN consider reframing for Business Strategy
4. ✅ Build relationship with both depts through conferences
