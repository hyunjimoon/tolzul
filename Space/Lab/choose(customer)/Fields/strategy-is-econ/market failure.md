as i was writing [[1intro]], i was curious whether below can be explained as market failure and am considering this to be my target to become [[conscientious contrarian]]
> “VC practices systematically disadvantage ventures that need flexibility most (hardware, high pivot costs), creating opportunity for frameworks that correct this misallocation.” is one market failure i’d like to prove with empirical evidences

*Market failure* is a situation where the free‑market allocation of goods and services isn’t Pareto‑efficient – in other words, resources aren’t being used in the best possible way for society ¹ ².

*What it looks like*
- *Complete failure*: no product is supplied at all (e.g., a missing market for a pure public good) ¹ ³.
- *Partial failure*: the product is supplied, but either the quantity is wrong or the price is off‑target ¹ ³.

*Common causes*
- *Externalities* – costs or benefits that affect third parties and aren’t reflected in the market price (pollution, vaccination) ² ⁴ ⁵.
- *Public goods* – non‑rival, non‑excludable goods that private firms won’t provide (national defence, street lighting) ² ⁴ ⁵.
- *Information asymmetry* – one side has better information, leading to adverse selection or moral hazard (used‑car market, insurance) ² ⁴ ⁶.
- *Market power / monopoly* – a single seller can set prices above competitive levels, reducing output ² ⁶ ⁵.
- *Incomplete markets* – missing markets for merit goods like education or health care ⁷.
- *Macro‑economic factors* – unemployment, inflation, or business‑cycle downturns that cause sustained under‑production ² ⁵.

*Illustrative examples*
- *Tobacco* – lack of information about health risks led to over‑consumption and a market collapse ¹.
- *Education* – public‑school monopolies can crowd out private providers, limiting choice ¹.
- *Traffic congestion* – roads are a common resource; individual drivers ignore the extra cost they impose on others, resulting in over‑use ².
- *Climate change* – carbon emissions are a global externality; the market doesn’t price the damage, so too much CO₂ is emitted ².

*How governments can respond*
- *Taxes or subsidies* to internalise externalities (e.g., carbon tax, education subsidies) ⁶ ⁵.
- *Regulation* such as antitrust laws to curb monopoly power ⁶ ⁵.
- *Provision of public goods* directly (e.g., national defence, public parks) ⁴ ⁵.
- *Information campaigns* to reduce asymmetry (e.g., nutrition labels, health warnings) ⁶.

In short, market failure occurs when the invisible hand falls short, and the usual remedy involves some form of government intervention to bring social costs and benefits back into alignment.
