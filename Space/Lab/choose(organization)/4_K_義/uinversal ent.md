Entrepreneurial decision making is fundamental to human experience, driven by both emotional and practical motivations. At its core, entrepreneurial decision making begins with selective optimism about specific opportunities ([[📜SS_stern24_model(beliefs, experimentation)]]). This optimism is natural to human experience - as Hyde ([[Space/Sources/Lab/📜hyde_twister_makes_world]]) notes, without some self-deception, life would be merely "a terrible, useless procedure bracketed by orgasm and putrefaction." The entrepreneurial decision process involves universal cognitive skills: envisioning possibilities, framing reality, applying logic, planning intentionally, and taking action to navigate uncertainty  ([[📜dimo]]). What makes entrepreneurial decision making distinctly human is how it channels our innate drive for cooperation and pro-social motivation into collaborative problem-solving that creates shared value (Tomasello, 2022) .
