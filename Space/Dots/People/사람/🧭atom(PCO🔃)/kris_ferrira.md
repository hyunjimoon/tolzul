Dear Kris, 

Thanks for Kris-fying me!

After defining my life goal with five functions (researcher, archivist, educator, human, transporter), finding object of each was challenging. However, they are being clearer thanks to you.

How Angie got Kris-fied:
your reading list -> researcher(application)
your love for OM academia -> archivist(academia)
your entrepreneurial research path -> transporter(startup)
your integrity and conversation skills -> human(human)

I'd love keep in touch with you, and share how the above effects ripple out,
Angie
