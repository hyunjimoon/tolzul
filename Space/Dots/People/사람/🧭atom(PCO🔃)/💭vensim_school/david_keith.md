co2 emission as a result (hybrid - battery material)
six scenarios for gas tax

federal, framework gas tax (vehicle ownership)

forio.com/app/mit/afv (doctoral paper; model platform, battery learning curve, infrastructure coevolution, emission )
profit and loss, background is vensim model (3-5 yrs out of date; effort and money)
baseline scenario

8 platforms in the model
package that allows you to build your own html files
trevous frank (tufts, cto of climate interactive)
well grounded (fuel price don't go up much; no exogenous that make EV appear)

best model (gas tax policy, to analyze, ramp in vmt, level of fiedelity)

infra co-evolution (demand, cost of search, buffer, keep a larger buffer - use the vehicle less), fuel economy, accounting,  VMT (vehicle miles travel) tax
