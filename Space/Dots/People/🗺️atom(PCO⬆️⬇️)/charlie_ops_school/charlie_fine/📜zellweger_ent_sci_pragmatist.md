Building on pragmatism, we advance an entrepreneur-as-scientist perspective and depict entrepreneurs as engaging in causally inferential action by forming beliefs, testing these beliefs, and responding to the feedback received. However, this sequence of entrepreneurial actions arrives with a set of companion doubts: namely, doubt about productmarket fit, because the entrepreneurs’ beliefs are self-chosen; doubt about feedback validity from false positives or false negatives; and doubt about over- and under-fitting in responses to feedback. We discuss the rationality of heuristics deployed by the entrepreneur to overcome these doubts. Our insights contribute to the microfoundations of entrepreneurial action and strategy by explaining how entrepreneurs generate the information to produce value out of uncertainty.

Diverse approaches (ideation, judgment, exploration) need integration.                           | Chesky (Airbnb) quote introducing pragmatic discovery: finding conference with sold-out hotels → creating bed and breakfast alternative          |
| 2. Theoretical Foundations                                     | Why is uncertainty central to entrepreneurship and what approach best addresses it?     | • Knight (1921/1985) on information unavailability<br>• Belief-oriented entrepreneurship theories<br>• Entrepreneur-as-scientist literature (Felin et al., 2019; Ries, 2011)                   | 🧠Entrepreneurship is fundamentally a knowledge problem: entrepreneurs first create uncertainty through novel beliefs, then reduce it through testing.                                                                                  | N/A - Conceptual framing                                                                                                                         |
| 3. Pragmatist Foundations of Entrepreneurial Action            | How does pragmatism inform entrepreneurial action under uncertainty?                    | • Classical pragmatism (Dewey, 1915; James, 1890; Peirce, 1931-1958)<br>• Cognitive sciences literature on brain as theory-testing device<br>• Knight's (1921) functional view of knowledge    | 🗺️Pragmatist entrepreneurs follow three-step process: abduction (belief formation), deduction (test design), and induction (belief updating) - distinct from causation or effectuation approaches.                                     | N/A - Theoretical development                                                                                                                    |

Self-selected belief creates endogenous uncertainty, with doubts about product-market fit as correlation between V(E) and V(M).        | Airbnb case example of identifying problem (hotel scarcity during conferences) and composing solution (airbeds in homes)                         |
