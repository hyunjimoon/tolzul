to MIT grads / innovators

choice to maximize solely for profits & power will leave you hollow – you fail the world, you fail yourself. 

imagine the world you want to create & work backwards, be open to the many paths & let the journey inform which ones will succeed
  
Uncertainty isn't high risk, it's unknown risk, it is the essence of opportunity (my favorite one)
  
technological leaps start with an act of faith, then you do experiments and those that work (on rare occasions) convert faith into scientific reality
 
welcome long odds and lead with imagination, approach the unknown with courage

angie was trying to ask below question to noubar during [[💭bayes(ent)]] conference

> This matters to me as parallel experiment is my operation but as phd student I've been heard so many criticism that I should be sequential. I'm careful that two of my advisors are in this room, but they showed great support of my operations. But I wish to earn their support not only by heart but also by brain.
 So, if I may summarize,
1. have you tried theorizing your parallel entrep with genetic algorithm?
2. is there anyway to systematically transfer learning across startups or purposeful experiment?
Imagine startup actions are dna base.
examples of types of leaps choice space (100 exploration; choice ); not assigne (centrally decide; reward disportionaly lower level) 
opportunity cost is may or may not work (unemployment)

- You explore a diverse set of opportunities (variation), 
- select promising ventures that passed the test (selection)
- refine these ventures based on feedback (mutation and crossover). 

Could you provide some facts that can turn this faith to belief?
