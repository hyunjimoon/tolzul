### **Future Shock (1970)**
* Coined "acceleration of change"
* Discussed "pace of life" and "durational expectancies"
* Introduced the concept of "temporal regulators"
* But doesn't use the specific term "clock speed"

### **The Third Wave (1980)**
* Talks about "synchronization" and "time horizons"
* Discusses how different waves (agricultural, industrial, information) operate at different paces
* Uses terms like "tempo" and "rhythm" rather than "clock speed"

### **Powershift (1990)**
* Focuses on "acceleration" and "real-time" operations
* Discusses "fast" vs "slow" economies
* Introduces concept of "acceleration effects"

### **Revolutionary Wealth (2006)**
* Talks about "de-synchronization" between institutions
* Uses the metaphor of different institutions moving at different "speeds" (like cars on a highway)
* Discusses "speed gaps" but not specifically "clock speeds"
