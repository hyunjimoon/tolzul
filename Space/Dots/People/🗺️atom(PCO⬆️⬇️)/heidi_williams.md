heidi chooses research topic with three standards:

1. question that I care about.
2. I have an idea of how to answer it. 
3. I think no one is going to write it if I don't write it, or it's not going to be written as well.


> 1. Most policymakers care a lot about who wins and who loses from a policy change, and care much less about abstract notions of efficiency
5. Focus on key government agencies or non-governmental groups that influence policymakers, and think about those agencies’ or groups’ interests
6. Communicate in non-technical ways that are not standard in the academy
7. When translating research findings into policy, be patient and persistent
8. Play the long game by encouraging students to take policy jobs in government or government-adjacent organizations
