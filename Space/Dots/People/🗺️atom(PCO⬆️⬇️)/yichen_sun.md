## Transcript

[https://otter.ai/u/zZfr26_kOKZ_7PCvQZYzbcr7ECo?view=summary](https://otter.ai/u/zZfr26_kOKZ_7PCvQZYzbcr7ECo?view=summary)

Angie Moon discussed her research on Bayesian operations for entrepreneur decision-making, focusing on early-stage startups. She proposed a variant of the news vendor model, replacing quantity with quality and adding two sources of uncertainty: customer and resource partner commitment. Angie used Tesla Roadster as an example, highlighting the importance of balancing desirability and feasibility. Sun Yichen suggested focusing on novelty over quality and emphasized the need for clear terminology. They debated the impact of overage and underage costs, marketing efforts, and the role of resource partners. Angie planned to use Tesla and iPhone as contrasting examples to illustrate her model's applicability.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Angie.H Moon - Clearly define the boundary of the problem being discussed, focusing on outsourcing and technical competency of upstream suppliers rather than just raw material suppliers.
- [ ] @Angie.H Moon - Consider using examples that contrast Tesla and iPhone to highlight the differences in feasibility, speed of iteration, and impact of overage vs. underage costs.
- [ ] @Angie.H Moon - Explore examples that illustrate the warning against both "tech push" and "customer pull" strategies, to provide a balanced perspective.
- [ ] @Angie.H Moon - Reach out to Shushing and provide regards, as she is also preparing for her qualifying exam soon.

## Outline

### Angie Moon's Research and Paper Submission

- Angie Moon explains her need to retake her qualification exam and mentions her second-year paper as the minimum threshold.
- Sun Yichen inquires about the actual exam and the paper submission process.
- Angie Moon clarifies that the paper submission requirements vary by program, student, and committee member.
- Angie Moon requests feedback on her research and shares her screen to discuss her work.

### Introduction to Bayesian Operations and News Vendor Model

- Angie Moon introduces her research on Bayesian operations and the news vendor model.
- She explains the news vendor model using the example of selling newspapers and the concept of inventory optimization.
- Angie Moon proposes a variant of the news vendor model for early-stage startups, focusing on quality rather than quantity.
- She discusses the commitment probability of stakeholders, including customers and resource partners, using Tesla Roadster as an example.

### Quality vs. Novelty in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

- Angie Moon differentiates her model from the classic news vendor model by considering two sources of uncertainty: customer and resource partner commitment.
- She explains the concept of quality as fitness of use and how it varies across different customers.
- Sun Yichen suggests that the model should focus on novelty rather than quality, as novelty is more relevant to early-stage startups.
- Angie Moon agrees to reconsider the terminology to avoid confusion and better align with existing literature.

### Mathematical Formulation and Model Assumptions

- Angie Moon shares her mathematical formulation for optimizing quality given uncertain commitment situations.
- She explains the key parameters: probability of commitment, cost variables, and speed of action.
- Sun Yichen questions the interdependency between customer and resource partner commitment and suggests simplifying assumptions.
- Angie Moon presents a diagram to illustrate the probability of commitment and the impact of speed on decision-making.

### Discussion on Quality and Novelty in Entrepreneurship

- Angie Moon and Sun Yichen discuss the challenges of defining quality and novelty in entrepreneurship.
- Sun Yichen emphasizes the importance of using terms that align with existing literature to avoid confusion.
- Angie Moon considers using desirability and feasibility as abstract concepts instead of quality and novelty.
- They discuss the implications of focusing on customer and resource partner commitment and the potential for network externalities.

### Examples and Case Studies for Model Validation

- Angie Moon presents examples to illustrate the application of her model, including Tesla, Facebook, and Amazon Prime.
- Sun Yichen suggests comparing examples that highlight the differences between hardware and software products.
- They discuss the importance of setting up a clear story and avoiding comparisons that may be misleading.
- Angie Moon considers using examples that show the impact of cost variables and the balance between desirability and feasibility.

### Final Feedback and Recommendations

- Sun Yichen provides final feedback on the examples and the overall structure of Angie Moon's research.
- They discuss the importance of defining the scope of the research and ensuring clarity in the introduction.
- Sun Yichen advises focusing on a single comparison to set up the motivation and extend the discussion in the conclusion.


q* = f(cost variables, stakeholder utility, speed)

novelty of the idea, instead of quality ; high ??  = desirability / feasibility; 

flying sports car: higher desirability and low feasibility = high quality value proposition

golf cart: low desirability and high feasibility = low quality value proposition

  

higher the quality = idea is (= PMF) ~ detailed execution plan (information richness of business plan)

tradeoff happening on 

- option1: desirability vs feasibility (tension has been acknowledge; innovation vs invention - desirability but may not feasible) - customer s-curve (diffusion) vs technology s-curve
- option2: commitment probability of customer vs commitment probability of resource partner
    
    
- adoption rate of customer (mu_c; invest in marketing) vs development speed of resource partner (mu_r; invest in operations)
    

🚨 (High overage, low underage → ↑quality) Tesla Roadster (2008) - Musk couldn't afford unsold inventory but missing early adopters was acceptable. Solution: Ultra-high quality ($109K) ensuring every unit sold. One-liner: "When Musk couldn't afford a single unsold Roadster, he pushed quality so high that demand exceeded supply."

🚨🚨 (V >> costs → parallel scaling) Amazon Prime (2005) - Bezos saw trillion-dollar potential dwarfing shipping losses. Built fulfillment centers and member base simultaneously. One-liner: "When Bezos glimpsed Prime's trillion-dollar future, temporary shipping losses became rounding errors."

🚨🚨🚨 (Radical innovation → uncertain commitment) iPhone (2007) - Revolutionary touchscreen made carrier/developer commitment uncertain. Apple's solution: Obsessive quality demos to AT&T, exclusive partnerships. One-liner: "When Jobs unveiled the iPhone, carrier skepticism forced Apple to over-invest in perfecting every swipe."

🚨🚨🚨🚨 (Well-calibrated quality → P_r + P_c > 1) Spotify (2008) - Calibrated streaming quality (q in 0, V) just right for both labels (royalties) AND users (convenience), achieving breakthrough dual commitment. One-liner: "Spotify found the sweet spot where record labels and music lovers both said yes."

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (Faster iteration → lower initial quality) Facebook at Harvard (2004) - Zuckerberg's "hot-or-not" site was crude but fast iteration let him test-and-improve across dorms weekly. One-liner: "Zuckerberg's first Facebook was embarrassingly simple—but launching in hours meant iterating faster than any competitor."

iphone easier

tesla vs betterplace (invest infrastructure - low quality = fbl) - lowered quality too much (marketing) - EV has higher overage cost - should have marketing more (buying)

- warning tech push: focus on technology (push)
    
- warning customer pull; when overage cost << underage cost (internet startup kept on pivoting - easy to listen to customer)
    
- capability push pivot vs customer pull pivot
    

larger overage cost and larger mu (action speed) crosses out the effect for tesla 

- mu_iphone < mu_tesla?? (ent / env(=cust+rp)=industry clockspeed)
    
-   
    

q* = 1/mu * ln(c_o / c_u) vs q* = 1/mu * ln(c_o / c_u)

whatever customer wants != quality / (low demand but high desire)

q* = 1/mu ln(2cu+V/2co+V)

barebone idea of facebook (primitive) - not well developed idea

- Musk: High quality/price to ensure zero unsold inventory (Cu>>Co)
    
- Zuckerberg: Low quality for maximum speed (mu small)

concept of desirability/feasibility (persuading resource partner = acquired fbl) with action speed ratio 🥹🥹

“quality" in the Spotify example means the overall value proposition design - not just audio streaming quality, but the complete package of features and terms that appeals to both sides.

For Spotify's "quality" this included:

- For record labels: Royalty payment structure, anti-piracy protection, user data analytics, promotional opportunities
    
- For music lovers: Monthly subscription price, catalog breadth, playlist features, mobile access, user interface
