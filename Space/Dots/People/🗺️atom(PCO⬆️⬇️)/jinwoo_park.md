In order to improve any system, 5 elements should be delicately analyzed in a broader context: man, machine, material, information, and energy. My first interest lies in a thorough understanding of each element. Only when the 5 elements are understood properly on its own, tools for accurate modeling, effective optimization can be applied to improve the system.
