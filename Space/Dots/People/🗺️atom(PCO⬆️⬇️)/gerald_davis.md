Davis’s research is broadly concerned with the **corporation as a social and economic vehicle.** 
[Recent writings](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/jerrydavis/articles?authuser=0) examine 
- why corporations have so little insight into their global supply chains and the moral dilemmas this poses
- why the social network of corporate elites has fallen apart
- what organizational alternative exist to the shareholder-owned corporation
- how national institutions shape corporate structures
- what this means for income inequality
- ;how platform capitalism might be tamed to meet human needs other than profit; how management research might help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; how new technologies have enabled worker political activism within the corporation; how social scientists can inform public opinion; and how information and communication technologies have enabled entirely new designs for economic organization. His current book project examines how shareholder capitalism came to seem inescapable, and how we can escape it.
