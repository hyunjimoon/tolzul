2025-05-25
- upside risk public incentive (first moer advanctage) to share the knowledge
- technical workshop - to collect knowledge
- institutional voids ; turne kana
- when industry outruns science, practitioner experiment on the ground 
- code -> store in library, 
- decision making under unceratinty -> agnostic ; monpoly
- information not sharing
- set the price high and monopolize
- information -> 
- dev.econ: top down knowledge injection (given info, not digest)
- info treatment (doesn't work) and info processing (unpack info)
- from behavioral perspective: upack dnoticing (pot size of the plant)
- peer learning : scott < angie
- from theory to practice (knowledge ; friction)
- max singal / noise 
- expert evaluator, problem (divergent behavior btw ent and )
- feasibility 
- learn by doing - deep thinking wo doing (apprentice model)
- independent - take the lead (i want them to help me)
- internal evaluating the external to update the internal (theory is prediction model)
- experiment (arnaldo, konig, spina, )
