Also what theme ties in all these principles is the "inversion" concept.

So what not to do, what isn't "sbf".

You get closer to the final product that way than being making too many proactive adjustments

> [!@ ] 🐣SO WHAT: follow SBF
   patterns and contrasts

🐣 WHAT: SBF tennis coordinates mind and body

- todo1: define combinations of S,B,F eg [1] is dictionary of most kumdo sequences 

- todo2: define todo1’s BASE as S,B,F eg [2] repeats coordinating chest-arm/leg-shoulder as a BASE

> [!@ ] 🐣WHY
   SBF = Federer = tennis 

eg analyze Federer using SBF
- todo3: why SBF is a BASE (mutually exclusive and extensive enough)

> [!@ ] 🐣HOW
   patterns and contrasts

💪short pattern 
- todo4: chest-arm/leg-shoulder

💪🦵long pattern 
- todo5: game strategies eg short ball given strong send -> approach shot -> volley )

🧭contrasting yes/no of SBF, defense and attack style
- todo6: define SBF and non-SBF and connect with short and long patterns 

- todo7: make analogy with 💧water (defense oriented) vs 🔥fire (attack oriented)
