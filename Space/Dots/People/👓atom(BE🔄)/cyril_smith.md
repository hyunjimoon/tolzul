A Search for Structure: Selected Essays on Science, Art and History ( The MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. USA) contains a collection of essays penned by Prof Cyril Stanley Smith over a few decades as he explored the interrelationship among art, technology and history. It has been hailed as his testament .The articles covered the nature of materials science, structure, substructure and superstructure, the role of history in structures, structural hierarchy in science, art and history, entity and entitation, on arts, innovation and technology, the shape of universal history. The reader is gently led from practical metallurgy and technology through art and history to philosophy and. may "recover some of the holistic enjoyment of the world that motivated seventeenth century figures such as Robert Hooke and Rene Descartes". Reproduced below with courtesy from the MIT Press are some excerpts.
