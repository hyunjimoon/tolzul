O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done;  
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;  
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,  
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:  
      But O heart! heart! heart!  
            O the bleeding drops of red,  
                  Where on the deck my Captain lies,  
                        Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells;  
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;  
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;  
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;  
      Here captain! dear father!  
            This arm beneath your head;  
                  It is some dream that on the deck,  
                        You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;  
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;  
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;  
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;  
      Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!  
            But I, with mournful tread,  
                  Walk the deck my captain lies,  
                        Fallen cold and dead.
