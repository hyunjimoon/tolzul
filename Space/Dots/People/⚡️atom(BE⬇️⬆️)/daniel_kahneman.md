conclusion bias, for example, which causes us to bend our judgments toward a desired outcome, making us interpret evidence in a skewed way. Just consider one Miami immigration court, where the chance of getting asylum was found to swing from 5 to 88 percent depending on which of two judges heard the case. These two judges were most likely suffering from conclusion bias. Needless to say, this kind of bias can have life-changing consequences.
