Pragmatic theory of truth
- Truth _happens_ to an idea, he said, when it succeeds in predicting new sense experiences
- [James’s bold analogy, truth has a practical cash value. Whether a belief is useful or valuable can be determined only by the individual. That’s because knowledge comes only from experience, and experience is always subjectively lived through by the individual.](https://medium.com/inserting-philosophy/william-james-and-the-cash-value-of-beliefs-43f8de669891)

- “Pragmatism asks its usual question. "Grant an idea or belief to be true," it says, "what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? How will the truth be realized? What experiences will be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?”

- truth is cash value of idea?
