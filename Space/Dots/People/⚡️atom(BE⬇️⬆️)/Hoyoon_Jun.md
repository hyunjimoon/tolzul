## personal statement
My interest in law was first piqued at a week-long work placement at my local high street firm, **Moss** **Solicitors**. Shadowing solicitors in several departments, I was particularly drawn to the emotionally charged area of family law. I was impressed with the personal interaction and inspired by the real difference the lawyers were making. Since then, I have aspired to be a lawyer who enacts real positive change.

Studying law as an academic discipline not only puts me one step closer to this goal but offers the opportunity to study a fascinating, dynamic subject. Law attempts to offer solutions to the problems of society today, often with complex difficulty, as I discovered when entering the New College of Humanities‚Äô law **essay competition** on the origins of human rights (in which I received a Runner up award out of 1,800 entries). Despite their recognition today, the implementation of human rights varies around the world and requires continuous reform. I also entered Trinity College‚Äôs Robert **Walker Essay Prize** (placing highly commended) on the topic of the regulation of social media, where I found that regulation proves necessary yet problematic, as it requires legal pressure. It has been all the more intriguing as the topic continues to often feature on the news. I read an article which stated that social media companies can regulate themselves through self-policing, but I wholeheartedly disagree. With the lack of any legal liability, companies have profit driven models that do not put required emphasis on moderating content - legal intervention gives companies responsibility. In the everchanging field of law, **reading ‚ÄòThe Economist‚Äô** has allowed me to keep up to date with topical affairs; an interesting article was about Donald Trump‚Äôs controversial election, where he is accused of having broken the law to further his candidacy. This pushed me to consider the political and moral implications of his actions, wherein political stability and legal accountability clash to find a fitting solution and showed the central role of law in the world of politics today.

A week-long work placement at **PricewaterhouseCoopers‚Äô** legal department provided a radically different perspective on a law career, with clientele such as Spotify and Visa. Working in employment law, my grasp of the analytical and organisational skills essential in a law degree was strengthened with a thought provoking task of writing up a guideline for the monitoring of employees. My interest in this field of law was furthered by attending the contract law lecture at the **Cambridge Law Conference** and reading relevant chapters in ‚ÄúWhat about Law?‚Äù; I was particularly impressed by the logical manner of awarding remedy in breach of contract. I have also read ‚ÄòEve was Framed‚Äô by Helena Kennedy. Previously, I was sceptical about the discriminatory treatment of women in British courts today, but after reading Kennedy‚Äôs argument, I have since changed my view; there is a clear lack of middle ground in terms of punishment for women. It has also led me to undertake an Extended Project on the case study of Dr Bawa-Garba‚Äôs striking off from the medical register, a decision which has been suggested to have racist and sexist motivations.

As well as my academic study, **volunteering** weekly at an old persons‚Äô care home has developed my ability to interact with people in an unfamiliar environment and I am part of the Senior Debating Society at my school, which has improved my public speaking and articulation of logical argument, all skills required in law. I have led a youth group at my church, which has strengthened my leadership qualities. My participation in my school‚Äôs Hockey First XI and my silver Duke of Edinburgh award has taught me teamwork and resilience, important in studying any degree.

I look forward to the challenge of studying Law at degree level and believe that I have the informed enthusiasm and determination to succeed at studying Law at University.
