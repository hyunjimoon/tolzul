## out

¬†Cognitive and Behavioral Genetics

¬† 30th - your encouragement genuinely brightened my research trajectory. I've been applying your work on language and reason to my research that bridges evolutionary and Bayesian entrepreneurship.¬†

I'm writing with an update that connects to our conversation. My chapter in a new Korean book, "AI ÎÇ¥Î∂ÄÏûêÎì§" (AI Insiders), applies your rationality principles to a puzzle:¬†**why did investors see completely opposite futures in the same Tesla prototype?**¬†The answer reveals how conflicting beliefs can accelerate innovation rather than hinder it.

**The Book's Mission**¬†Following your work on making complex ideas accessible, we're bringing rational thinking about AI to Korean readers. Our 19 authors discovered that¬†**true AI innovation requires philosophical depth, not technical mastery**¬†- essentially applying your "rationality as means to ends" to AI adoption.

**Why This Matters**¬†That Han Kang quote I shared about conscience being "the most terrifying thing in the world" resonates here. Just as she wrote about collective courage, Korea needs collective rationality about AI - separating hype from reality, understanding what AI can and cannot do.

**The Request**¬†Would you consider a brief endorsement (3-4 lines)? Your voice would mean enormously to Korean readers who need, as you put it, "cognitive tools to navigate an uncertain world." All royalties support disadvantaged students pursuing engineering.

**Quick Context:**

- Expected reach: 50,000+ copies (significant in Korea)
- Co-endorsers: Jungwoo Ha (NAVER AI), Sung Kim (Upstage CEO)
- My chapter shows how Bayesian reasoning turns investor disagreement into strategic advantage

  

With gratitude for your influence on my thinking,

Angie Moon

| 1994             | The Language Instinct                                   | Language is a biological adaptation, an instinct that humans are born with                                | how complex systems (like language) emerge from the interaction between innate capacities and environmental feedback. Pinker's analysis of how theoretical linguistic knowledge interfaces with practical language use parallels your interest in the dynamics between theory and implementation. His exploration of how language acquisition occurs through multiple parallel processes aligns with your investigation of serial versus parallel processing in knowledge architectures. |

Pinker's discussion of how the mind coordinates multiple levels of understanding and decision-making directly relates to your analysis of implementation-to-development ratios. His exploration of how theoretical models emerge from practical understanding could inform your investigation of theory-first versus understanding-first approaches.                                                            |

A major inspiration to me when I was an undergraduate.                                                                                                |

The second was Reflections on Language (1975). Both have illuminating discussions of the roots of Chomsky's thinking in Enlightenment-era thinkers, and of the connections of language to theories of human nature.                                                                                                                   |
| The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language | Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey Pullum | Nonfiction | Language                       | I got to this massive reference work to understand the logic of English. Unlike the primary linguistics literature, where you'll find a mess of contradictory theories and a blizzard of inconsistent jargon, this book analyzes every grammatical construction in English in a consistent framework, with depth and insight eye-opening short of astonishing.                       |
| Words and Things                              | Roger Brown                           | Nonfiction | Language                       | No list of books on human nature would be complete without work on language, and this classic, by my graduate school advisor, is still a delight fifty years after its debut. Brown discusses, among other things, whether linguistics determines thought, the evolution of language, and the revolution in sound symbolism.                                                         |

Wise and occasionally hilarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I read it as a "Young Adult," but it's informative for all adults too.                                                                                                                                                                 |

The opening essay on the architecture of complexity is one of the deepest (yet thoroughly accessible) essays I've read.                                                                                                                                                 |

This delightful book was among the inspirations for Enlightenment Now. Among the differences: I'm less of a libertarian than Matt, and in my follow-up, to discuss the harder challenges to rational optimism: climate change, nuclear weapons, inequality, secular stagnation, authoritarian populism.                                                      |

"Don't talk rot," advised Fink-Nottle; "it is a beautiful world. The sky is blue, the birds are singing."                        |

The USA is far more violent than other democracies, the south more than the north and blacks more than whites. Courtwright shows that large swaths of America were settled by young men from long in anarchy, encouraging violent competition for dominance and a premium on toughness and need.          |

I like everything that Gottschall writes, and this is a gem of literary Darwinism, combining a deep understanding of evolution with erudite analyses of the worlds that Homer lived in and wrote about.                                                                                          |

Writing in the early 1950s, with the ashes of World War II still warm and the nuclear arms race underway, he defied every notation and wrote: "A long future may perhaps be coming without a third world war in it."                                                          |

It came out at the same time as The Better Angels of Our Nature, and sadly got submerged in the publicity surrounding my book.

Brush up your history, and marvel at the clarity and stupidity of our species.                                                                                                                                               |

This summation of Chagnon's thirty years among the "fierce people" of the Amazon rainforest is witchy (and often humorous) written, free of romantism, and packed with implications for human nature. |

| Rational choice in an uncertain world         | Reid Hastie and Robyn M. Dawes        | Nonfiction | Rationality                    | This is technically a textbook, and isn't marketed as a book you bring to the beach. But sometimes it's more satisfying to have the big ideas on a topic patiently explained to you in an orderly fashion than to try to pick them up from stories and arguments. This paperback explains the famous discoveries by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman on biases in human reasoning.   |
| The constitution of knowledge                 | Jonathan Rauch                        | Nonfiction | Rationality                    | If humans are the rational animal, why does the world seem to be losing its mind? Why the fake news, the conspiracy theories, the post-truth rhetoric? Rauch explains that truth is a precious commodity, which none of us is smart enough to discover on our own. We depend on institutions and norms to make us collectively smarter than any of us is individually.               |

This lively collection explains what "probability" even means, and presents many puzzles from everyday reckoning of risk.                                                                 |

He didn't think of everything, but he explained an astonishing range of topics related to rationality, including causation versus correlation, is versus ought, and individual versus collective well-being. And he explored them with wit and clarity, putting modern academic writing to shame.                           |

In this timely book he shows that smart people, and everyone else, are victims of a powerful bias to show that our own tribe is virtuous and wise and knowledgeable and the other tribe is evil and stupid and ignorant.                                           |
