[[Ready-Fire-Aim _ Neil Gershenfeld _ TEDxMIT Salon - English (auto-generated).txt]]
 softer solutions are more adhesive to needs in different domain (ready, fire, aim by Neil Gershenfeld)
			   - fluidic ribosome (create biology for nonbiological) -> genome transplantation
			   - rfid tag (can't read one at a time, nonlinearity in material, spin resonance) -> spin-spin exchange quantum computing
			   - glue composite parts -> snap parts, modulus ultralight material
			   - weak yo-yo ma hand protection (hand tomography)-> auto safety sensor for infants
			   - apply principles of internet into device physics -> iot


1. Fluidic ribosome: Was trying to make fluidic ribosome for non-biological systems. Failed due to bubbles blocking particles. Then Manu suggested using bubbles for microfluidic bubble logic, leading to genome transplantation.
2. RFID tag: Started with multiple tag reading problem, explored spin resonance for nonlinearity. Numbers were "hopeless" but led to quantum computation discovery.
3. Glue composite: Failed to find better glues, pivoted to no-glue snap-together design, achieving highest modulus ultralight material.
4. Yo-Yo Ma's cello: Hand interference in sensing was an obstacle that led through multiple steps (tomography, magic trick) to auto safety sensor.
5. Internet physics: Tried inter-networking at physics level - "terrible idea", noisy, not robust. Internet founders said project was "stupid" but implementation interesting, leading to IoT concepts.
