[Words of Praise] The Impenetrable Shield, "Father of Homomorphic Encryption"
February 19, 2023, 08:00
Chun Jeong-hee, Professor of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University

The history of cryptography dates back to primitive times. Cryptography is the most essential tool and technology in the battle between 'protection' and 'theft,' and can either protect or take lives. A representative example is the cryptographic battle between the Enigma and Bombe during World War II. After 'Alan Turing,' the father of computers, developed the Bombe to completely decrypt Germany's Enigma cipher and prevented the massacre of 14 million people, cryptographic technology has continued to evolve, though it has always faced the threat of being compromised. In the ongoing efforts to protect valuable information, we met with Professor Chun Jeong-hee, the developer of the HEAAN cryptographic solution based on the 'Holy Grail of Cryptography,' homomorphic encryption.

â—‹ The Cryptographer Entering the Startup World

Professor Chun Jeong-hee is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University and the CEO of CryptoLab, a cryptographic technology company. In person, he appeared not only as the academic 'scientist' and 'professor' described in numerous articles, but also as a 'storyteller' who easily explained difficult technical terms. How did storyteller Chun Jeong-hee enter the battlefield of fierce information security?

"I started in number theory and researched pure mathematics, always wondering how well my research results could be applied in reality, which led me to cryptography. Out of curiosity and drive, I came to develop the homomorphic encryption technology HEAAN."

What is the technology of homomorphic encryption, the core technology of HEAAN, developed by Chun Jeong-hee and known as the fourth-generation encryption? He explained it using the example of data in a vault.

"Homomorphic encryption protects computations. Before homomorphic encryption, you had to take data out of the 'encryption' vault to process it and then put it back in the vault. During this process, data could be exposed and become a target for hackers. But with homomorphic encryption, data can be processed while remaining encrypted in the vault. You can only access the data after processing is complete."

We are currently living in an age of data deluge. In particular, machine learning or AI is a highly advanced data collection and technology. However, it is challenging to protect privacy while using such data, so there is ongoing research to address this. Professor Chun Jeong-hee's focus in commercializing homomorphic encryption was also on protecting data that contains personal information.

"Recent research is being conducted on machine learning or AI that protects data privacy. Among them, Private AI is advantageous because it uses homomorphic encryption technology to ensure security. Data containing personal information requires encryption protection. Therefore, we prioritized the commercialization of this technology in data-intensive fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. I also believe that homomorphic encryption can lead to significant achievements in areas such as defense, education, and taxation."

â—‹ Cryptography Creating Order in the Data Era

"A trend ongoing for decades is the effort to build a cyber world on the internet. While convenient due to its lack of physical constraints, the cyber world has challenges in ensuring rights protection. Homomorphic encryption, blockchain, and other technologies have emerged to protect this cyber world, and such technologies that create order will continue to evolve based on mathematics."

Professor Chun Jeong-hee also pointed to SNARK (Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge) as a next-generation technology to watch out for, beyond services like the metaverse and blockchain. SNARK is a computation verification technology that enables verifying the validity of encrypted sensitive personal information in a concise way, similar to homomorphic encryption and quantum-resistant encryption. He expects SNARK to be researched and used more widely in the future.

As cryptographic and security technologies mature, they will simplify the process for users. He also mentioned that as authentication technology advances, it will be possible to perform multi-factor authentication or passive authentication, checking various elements without requiring conscious user action like fingerprint or iris recognition. This makes the authentication process more convenient while also enhancing security.

"In the Hollywood movie 'Minority Report,' Tom Cruise's character is recognized as he walks down the street, and tailored advertisements appear on digital billboards. I believe that within the next decade, when using computers, user authentication will occur naturally, ensuring that no one but the authenticated user can access or retrieve the data. Of course, homomorphic encryption will play a significant role in this."

â—‹ What Made Me Who I Am Today

Professor Chun Jeong-hee had two questions he was eager to answer: one about what led him to challenge various fields and the other about his personal philosophy to share with others. He deeply contemplated both questions and answered them twice.

The question I was most curious about when preparing these words of praise was what motivated Professor Chun Jeong-hee to take on challenges as a mathematician, professor, cryptographer, and CEO.

"It's an interesting question. What made me walk this path? I don't think there was a big reason. Instead, I believe small things accumulated to make me who I am today. My desire to achieve the best results at every moment led me down this path. By continuously optimizing in each situation, I ended up where I am now."

The second question was about the philosophy he wanted to share with his students, researchers, or employees.

"What I emphasize the most is to 'have fun and enjoy it.' People have more energy and can achieve more when they are having fun. The next thing I emphasize is that 'doing what you can do well is better than trying to do it all.' I often tell those around me that it's much more valuable to do well on a small portion or what you enjoy, even if you give up on the majority."

Professor Chun Jeong-hee finds enjoyment in researching cryptography, particularly homomorphic encryption, which he believes is just starting its journey toward commercialization and will contribute to creating a new world that safely protects people.

"Currently, cryptographic technology is seen more as an inconvenience than something to be grateful for. As a cryptographer, my wish is to overcome the imperfections of cryptography so that everyone can live safely without requiring knowledge of cryptography or difficult procedures. I look forward to a safer future created by homomorphic encryption."

Meanwhile, Professor Chun Jeong-hee also showed a developer's mindset when offering his opinion on NTIS. Invention starts with a desire to alleviate discomfort. He proposed an idea for the future development of NTIS as a platform.

"I work with various organizations on projects and provide information. In the process, it's often necessary to repeat the same tasks or search for information across multiple sites. NTIS, which integrates and manages various information, minimizes this process, which is its biggest advantage. One suggestion I have is to establish a system where universities can directly transfer or download information from NTIS when submitting performance evaluations or materials for BK evaluation, rather than submitting them manually."

â—‹ The One Move That Made My Life: "Choosing What I Can Do Well"

The one move that made Professor Chun Jeong-hee's life was his quick selection of a field in which he could excel and his intense challenge in that field. He emphasized this several times during the interview.

"Finding what you like is important. But it's also essential to keep thinking about what you can be competitive in."

While he has loved mathematics for a long time, he said there were several moments that he considered turning points.

"During my graduate school days, I began to wonder if the mathematical world would mourn if I disappeared while studying and researching math intensely. The worries lingered for a long time, but I wasn't confident I could make a significant impact in mathematics."

What Professor Chun Jeong-hee found he could do well was cryptography research, and he is working tirelessly to develop cryptographic technology with sharp insight and effort to create a world where everyone can safely protect their information.
