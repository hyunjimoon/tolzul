i prompted below to katie as we have shared interest on model synthesis & entrepreneurship and angie would like to get advice on building domain specific language for entrepreneurial operations from katie

Q1. does it make sense if i say nail scale sail comic book is an attempt for defining semantically rich but syntactically restrictive entrepreneurial operations? full paper below where ten casestudies are compactly used to illustarte ten tools:
[Fine22_OM4Entrep.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19895422/Fine22_OM4Entrep.pdf)

Q2. if Q1 is yes, if you were to design a domain specific language for entrepreneurial operations (below structure), where'd you spend most time developing?

Q3. what do you think about vikash's separation between generative program and causality?

> Instead, we're ⭐️generating generative programs that are highly stochastic⭐️, vastly oversimplified surrogates for whatever was really happening. That's to say they're ⭐️not causal⭐️. I mean, they may have some elements of causality, like the change point, might accurately capture just a very limited, basic fact that at some point, the future is independent of the past. Is something exogenous change, but I think ⭐️they're completely non causal, but they're pretty phenomenological⭐️. I guess they don't have much in the way of mechanism, certainly not explicit mechanism. I think there's something quite interesting here about probabilistic models that are semantically very expressive, but syntactically, very simple. 



should look like probabilistic program synthesis should ?
