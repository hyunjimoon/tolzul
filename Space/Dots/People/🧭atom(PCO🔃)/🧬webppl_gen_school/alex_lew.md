## **1. 📝collect journal's evaluation metric** 
- (i) Does the paper address a question of managerial importance and relevance? 
- (ii) Does it change our thinking on an important topic in entrepreneurship or innovation? 
- (iii) Does the paper use appropriate methodology to answer the question convincingly and rigorously?  
- (iv) Does it provide improved management principles to operate new ventures or manage innovation?  Successful manuscripts will usually be grounded in important phenomena; purely theoretical/conceptual pieces must explain the connection to managerial or policy importance. 
## 2. 🤜 human experts' recipe 
> 2. Based on Jose Arrieta's "Dialectical Contributions: Triangles All the Way Up," the human experts' recipe for creating impactful scientific contributions can be summarized as:

1. **Find the right audience** - Identify scholars who will care about your contribution and engage with your ideas. Without the right audience, even groundbreaking work will be ignored.
2. **Create a dialectical contribution** with three key components:
    - **Surprising element** (Thesis-Antithesis tension): Present a taken-for-granted idea (thesis) that your audience accepts, then introduce a counterpoint (antithesis) that challenges this assumption. This creates the "Huh" moment that captures attention.
    - **Valid element**: Make your contribution feel intuitively true to experts. The audience needs to "suspend disbelief" and feel that your idea makes sense within their existing framework.
    - **Important element**: Demonstrate why your contribution matters. This creates the "oh shit, if that is true..." reaction that motivates readers to continue engaging with your work.
3. **Guide toward synthesis** - Lead the audience to a new level of understanding that combines the thesis and antithesis into a more comprehensive theory.
