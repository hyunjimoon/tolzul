Advising Philosophy.Â 

In my view (and that of many others), the goal of a PhD is to become an independent researcher who can identify interesting and impactful questions and be equipped with the tools needed to address them. More specifically, your dissertation will consist of 2â€“5 research projects (typically 3) that collectively address a larger research question. You will become the leading expert on that topic, and each chapter may correspond to a publication. This is a common expectation for receiving a PhD and provides a baseline for setting goals for your milestones.

  

My hope is to work hands-on with you in the first few years to develop research questions. However, the sooner you take ownership of your own research agenda, the better it will be for your success in the PhD. As an advisor, I value high-quality research more than the number of papers. At the same time, I understand the typical frustration students feel when their advisor keeps dragging out their work without making progress. We will find our comfortable spot without compromising the quality of our work.

I donâ€™t want to impose any specific lab policy, although I will provide a reasonable baseline with a lot of room for discussion. Lab and graduate programs are flexible by nature if we are on the right trajectory. My consideration is whether you and I can align our success and whether our expectations for commitments are on the same page. I value honesty in communication, hope to develop our relationship based on trust, and wish to build a lifelong relationship as colleagues.Â 

  

Expected Milestones.Â 

I want to ensure that each student has their own distinct expertise and focus. Here are the expected milestones. I encourage my students to spend 1â€“2 years developing technical depth through self-learning and coursework. In parallel, you will also have the opportunity to be involved in projects that are practically valuable and technically solid, though they may not be groundbreaking. For your first few projects, if you prefer, I can suggest a well-defined problem that has a clear path to publication. After gaining familiarity with the field, technical depth, and hands-on research experience, you will gradually develop your own interests and define your own research question by the start of your third year. We can work on them together if that moment does not arise naturally. Once you identify your research interests and career goals, you can pursue groundbreaking research if you aim for academia, or gain more hands-on experience with state-of-the-art methodologies if you decide to go to industry. Based on your goals, you can also explore broader opportunities, such as initiating collaborations with other faculty members and pursuing internships.

  

Funding.Â 

In principle, all of my PhD students will be fully funded throughout their entire PhD program. Pursuing a PhD is a full-time job, and it is difficult to succeed without reliable financial support. Here are my expectations for students. If you are funded through a TAship, you are responsible for fulfilling all your duties, but note that both university policy and I will protect you from overwork. If you are funded through an RAship, you are responsible for delivering the outcomes required by the projectâ€™s PIs. Be aware that these tasks may sometimes involve work that is not directly included in your publications, but you are still expected to complete them.

In general, you should think of me as your mentor, friend, family, and number one supporterâ€”but in the specific context of being funded by an RAship, you can simply think of me as your boss (a really nice one, though :D). On my end, I am committed to securing research-oriented funding sources that minimize non-publishable tasks. Iâ€™ll share in advance what I know about available funding and the projects you may be involved in. We will also work together to receive fellowships that allow you more freedom to explore your interests with fewer constraints. These opportunities will also strengthen your CV.Â 

Submission Venue.Â 

For journal submission, venues are included but not restricted toÂ 

Top Transportation Journal (e.g., TR Part A, B, C, and Transportation Science)

Top AI conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI)

Top Journals in Operations Research (e.g., OR, MS, MSOM)Â 

  

For conference submission, venues are included but not restricted to

Transportation Research Board (TRB)

INFORMS Annual meetings

INFORMS Transportation Science and Logistics (TSL)

IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)

Meetings.Â 

I will meet with my students weekly one-on-one. During these meetings, we can discuss research projects and career considerations (e.g., collaborations, fellowships, internships). Outside of these meetings, you can usually reach me on demand for quick questions via our lab Slack channel or email. For our meetings, I expect you to bring your work in a digestible form, whether thatâ€™s a LaTeX document you walk me through or an informal slide deck to talk through. This will be good practice in a safe environment, which will eventually help you become a stronger presenter at conferences, job talks, and interviews. It is also a useful way to track progress and stay motivated, since publication is usually a long-term process

  

Working Hours and Locations.Â 

A reasonable minimum working hours for me is a fairly focused 8 hours per day, which includes 3-4 hours of fully-focused mode. You can choose the most productive time to work. Honestly, I work extended hours but am not afraid to take days off when Iâ€™m not productive enough. On normal days, meetings and class attendance are expected to be in person because of the many benefits of face-to-face interaction. If you are out of town for any reason, we can reschedule meetings or meet over Zoom. However, I expect you to communicate with me in advance if you plan any personal or work-related travel.

I encourage you to take at least 4 weeks per year (or more) fully away from research and emails. Having flexibility in working hours and locations during my PhD enhanced my productivity, and I want to provide the same experience for you. However, we may need to explore alternatives if this setup negatively affects your productivityâ€”and I hope that wonâ€™t be the case. My ideal student is self-motivated, passionate, and responsible in their work. At the same time, I believe everyone should pursue their own happiness and deserves to enjoy life. We all need to find our own comfortable spot, and I will support you in finding yours.Â 

General Advice for Everyone.Â 

I want you to make the best choice for yourself. List all the relevant aspects, gather information, and ask around. Think it through and make your own decision. I sincerely hope your best choice is me :D.
