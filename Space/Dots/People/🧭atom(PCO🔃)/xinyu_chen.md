- Angie shared her interest in using proxy reward function to model entrepreneurial decision making which proceeds with three phases:
	- phase1 (nail): learning the structure of internal (organization's productivity) and external (market, technological and customer's evolution over time) 
	- phase2 (scale): parameter fitting based on the inferred structure 
	- phase3 (sail): making phase2 more efficient and sustainable
- Xinyu shared his interest in state space model - sequence; (fft: TlogT, inverse (matrix)); imputation - change btw bf and af covid
- interested in physics driven spatio-temporal learning (including manifold and laplacian) 
	- angie emphasize causal model (business cycle from [[mng(market)]] as [[üè≠def(generate)]]
	- degree of the parameter's affect on interpretability, use different inference algorithms (MCMC vs admm, conjugate descent for AR model coefficient, RANK)

- Xinyu introduced [Data-Driven Economic NMPC Using Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2019.2913768)
- Angie asked difference with his approach with [birthday problem Bayesian workflow](https://avehtari.github.io/casestudies/Birthdays/birthdays.html) which is relatively interpretable based on time series component decomposition; Xinyu answered space part is added ("spatio"-temporal) in his approach and improved efficiency from FFT

- Xinyu shared interest in [Physics-informed dynamic mode decomposition](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0576), Angie introduced [Geometric Deep Learning Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478), [website](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/), [interview of the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZB1hIJ4u8&ab_channel=MachineLearningStreetTalk)
