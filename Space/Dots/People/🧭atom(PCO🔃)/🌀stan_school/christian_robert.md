- [Conformal Bayesian Computation](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2021/07/08/conformal-bayesian-computation/)"Edwin and Chris note that the Bayesian predictive itself acts like a conformity measure"
	- The method starts with the choice of a conformity measure that measures how well each observation in the sample agrees with the sample. Which is exchangeable and hence leads to a rank statistic from which a p-value can be derived. Which is the empirical cdf associated with the observed conformities. Following Vovk et al. (2005) and Wasserman (2011) Edwin and Chris note that the Bayesian predictive itself acts like a conformity measure. Predictive that can itself be approximated by MCMC and importance sampling
- [Understanding computation Bayesian ](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/understanding-computational-bayesian-statistics-a-reply-from-bill-bolstad/)The Gibbs sampling algorithm is especially well suited for hierarchical models. 
	- Including a short diversion into the empirical Bayes method for hierarchical models for comparison purposes.
	- Jeffreys’ priors for scale parameters in the hierarchical model that cause the problem.
