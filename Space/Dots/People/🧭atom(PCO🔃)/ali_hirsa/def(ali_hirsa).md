> They are deep neural networks that contain two networks, competing with one another, that is where the name is coming from, used in unsupervised machine learning

PIDE solving unsupervised learning is spin-offed from PDE solving supervised learning. Here, given the boundary conditions, neural network becomes the solution itself, compared to neural network 

Likewise, can convolution between prior distribution and likelihood be spin-offed to unsupervised learning where given the boundary value (observation (y)), certain range of parameter value (once simulation reached equilibrium) be regarded as the solution (prior)? To be specific, the prior would be the solution for self-consistency equation which is an integral forumaltion.This process may be related to Bayesian deconvolution (a.k.a. prior elicitation, inverse probelm)
