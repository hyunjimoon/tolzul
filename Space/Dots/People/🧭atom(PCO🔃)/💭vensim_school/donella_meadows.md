Places to Intervene in a System (in increasing order of effectiveness)

12. Numbers: Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, and standards

11. Buffers: The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their Ô¨Çows

10. Stock-and-Flow Structures: Physical systems and their nodes of intersection

9. Delays: The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes

8. Balancing Feedback Loops: The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct

7. Reinforcing Feedback Loops: The strength of the gain of driving loops

6. Information Flows: The structure of who does and does not have access to information

5. Rules: Incentives, punishments, constraints

4. Self-Organization: The power to add, change, or evolve system structure

3. Goals: The purpose of the system

2. Paradigms: The mind-set out of which the system‚Äîits goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters‚Äîarises

1. Transcending Paradigms

Guidelines for Living in a World of Systems

1. Get the beat of the system.

2. Expose your mental models to the light of day.

3. Honor, respect, and distribute information.

4. Use language with care and enrich it with systems concepts.

5. Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantiÔ¨Åable.

6. Make feedback policies for feedback systems.

7. Go for the good of the whole.

8. Listen to the wisdom of the system.

9. Locate responsibility within the system.

10. Stay humble‚Äîstay a learner.

11. Celebrate complexity.

12. Expand time horizons.

13. Defy the disciplines.

14. Expand the boundary of caring.

15. Don‚Äôt erode the goal of goodness.


1. expand the boundary of caring, your model's time and space horizon requires testing tool: [Stock-flow_consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-flow_consistent_model)"black holes" have to be avoided, where money vanishes without an offsetting entry in the balance sheet, "rejects classical dichotomy, the neutrality of money and general equilibrium theory."

2. Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable.

3. Don‚Äôt erode the goal of goodness.
