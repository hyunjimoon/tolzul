Remaining questinos: 3. discrete event simulation ?

agent-based modeling (complex feature of system, special-geo, heterog, )
- curse of dimensionality
- local changes
- relational (mother and a father) even continuous 
- nested context
- multiscale (body weight, composition, clinical )

longitunal variables
capturing the history of data; dynamic model to empirical data (compartmental model)
episode of care (memoryless nature of stock)

1. multiscale - biodynamics (agent-based + hybrid; different levels of scale)
immune system - epidemic 

2. fitting gaussian process (nonparameteric)
state-resetting (extended karman filtering, narrow perspective of filtering) MLE state-estimation; 1970 parameter / state estimation 

prior preventing basin of attraction 

alternative hypothesis (both maintained)
latent 

calibration is too static, recognize contingent (unfolding data over time)

calibration one end of a continum; approximate Bayesian computation, latent state estimation
model structure

theta can be latent or not (msr related), can have different measurement interval
episodic data (waste water)

time gets longer, uncertainty increase
90 seminar: calibration is about parameter value 
10, 20 pruning stochastic system 

It started from dynamic decision from Public Health

- better to explain example first or theory first?
- adding data to y vector (agree with 1..t?)
