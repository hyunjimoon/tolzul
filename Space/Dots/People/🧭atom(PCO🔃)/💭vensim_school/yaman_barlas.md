- wrote SYSTEM DYNAMICS: SYSTEMIC FEEDBACK MODELING FOR POLICY ANALYSIS
```
1. Introduction

2. Dynamic problems and systemic feedback perspective

3. Modeling methodology and tools

4. Dynamics of basic feedback structures

5. Formulation principles and generic model structures

6. Mathematical and technical issues

7. Model testing, validity, analysis, and design

8. Conclusions and future
```

- talk on model testing and pattern-based policy parameter prescription

Question to Yaman:
- What do you teach in 
	- W7-2 "coupling of positive and negative feedback loops"?
- What motivated you to do research in bio and health policy (among other application domain)?
- 

- Dynamics of Socio-Economic Systems (IE 550)Â
