Thanks. Conscientious contrarian is my default attitude so both feedbacks reflect my intention. However, I'm beginning to suspect SFMBAs  market place is not where innovative (:= idea creating value in market place) perspective

is I inferred i) innovation can be misinterpreted as lack of professionalism
experienced how innovative intent convoluted with heterogenous customer utility chaos for those who's growing discipline. So yes, I'd concentrate supporting students prepare final exam, using the existing slide style.

this customer segment and I have different goal is met. But I learned the precision of innovation is low 

innovation is the last thing that'd be appreciated by customers taking three classes

- asked markovian w.r.t. what and he mentioned everything is markovian (as present determines future, independent of the past) but need test statistics to judge whether something is markovian or not. 

- vivek also made connection with "adding noise, augmented variable, update" and seemed to be aware of hierarchical bayes' connection with augmented variable
