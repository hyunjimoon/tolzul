| **Core Definition**                 | Direct selection shapes features for immediate functional benefit                      | Previously selected feature gains additional use while maintaining original function   | Non-functional trait becomes useful through novel combinations                              |
| **Decision Process**                | Sequential optimization (function‚ÇÅ ‚Üí function‚ÇÅ‚Å∫) with full evaluation before each step | Branching exploration (function‚ÇÅ ‚Üí function‚ÇÅ AND function‚ÇÇ) with structured evaluation | Parallel convergence (element‚ÇÅ + element‚ÇÇ + element‚ÇÉ ‚Üí new function) with ongoing discovery |
| **Probability Structure**           | Non-exchangeable sequence: P(xt+1\|xt) ‚â† P(xt+1)                                       | Partial exchangeability: P(f1,f2\|f0) = P(f2,f1\|f0)                                   | Full exchangeability: P(e1,e2,e3) = P(e3,e1,e2)                                             |
| **Interdependence Type** (Thompson) | Sequential: Unidirectional workflow where outputs become inputs                        | Reciprocal: Two-way dependencies between units                                         | Pooled: Independent units working in parallel                                               |

| **Biological Examples**             | Bird feathers for temperature regulation                                               | Feathers: Temperature ‚Üí flight capability                                              | Fish air bladder ‚Üí lungs\nJaw bones ‚Üí ear bones                                             |

Key changes made:
1. Restored original column titles (Direct/Co-opted/Co-opted Non- Adaptation)
2. Aligned probability structures with Thompson's interdependence types
3. Added explicit interdependence type row to show mapping
4. Reorganized examples to better match interdependence patterns
5. Kept consistent emoji indicators (üå±,ü¶Ö,üêü) from original framework

3Ô∏è‚É£three from five indistinguishable options to angie -> need John's choice:  
  
a. critique of existing sequential vs parallel search literature 1) time opportunity cost , 2)¬†exchangeability between capital and time cost, 3) intention (i.e. constraint vs restraint)  
b. causal tree of different factors to separate descriptive vs prescriptive (uncertainty -> navigation mode -> knowledge cumulativeness ->time)  
c. probability measure construction from exchangeability of process or goal of ideas  
d. distinguish Bayes decision theory EV(i \in C) and¬†Bayes¬†sampling/inference algorithms (MCMC). decision feels sequential than sampling (why?).  
e. stopping time from innovation conjecture

| Approach             | One idea developed, tested, and pivoted at a time (sequential pivot) | Multiple ideas developed, tested, and pivoted simultaneously (parallel pivot) |
| Risk Management      | Lower risk per idea, deeper analysis possible                        | Higher risk diversification across multiple projects                          |
| Resource Utilization | Focused on one project, optimizes depth                              | Spread across multiple projects, potential dilution                           |
| Innovation Speed     | Slower due to linear progression                                     | Higher potential through cross-pollination, economies of scale                |

| Focus & Quality      | Better focus and quality on single project                           | Risk of reduced quality due to divided attention                              |
| Market Testing       | Sequential validation, slower process                                | Faster testing (time/test decrease), simultaneous comparison possible         |
| Feedback Integration | Direct and focused on current project                                | More complex, spread across multiple projects                                 |
| Outcome Measurement  | Easier to measure single project impact                              | More challenging to attribute specific outcomes                               |
| Ideal Use Case       | Limited resources, need for deep testing                             | Dynamic fields requiring rapid innovation                                     |
