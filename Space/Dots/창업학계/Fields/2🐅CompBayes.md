# 🐅 Computational Bayesian Analysis - 계산적 베이지안 분석

> *"What are the right things to do?"*

## Field Overview

CompBayes field는 **베이지안 추론**, **불확실성 정량화**, **인과추론**을 통해 전략적 의사결정을 연구합니다. 한산대첩의 학익진처럼, 데이터 기반 전략과 증거 기반 선택이 핵심입니다.

### Core Questions
- How do we quantify uncertainty in decisions?
- How can we learn from limited data?
- What is the causal effect of interventions?
- How do we update beliefs with new evidence?

### Key Journals
- **Journal of the American Statistical Association**
- **Bayesian Analysis**
- **Statistical Science**
- **Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics**

## Methodology Focus

### Bayesian Methods
- MCMC (HMC, NUTS)
- Variational inference
- Hierarchical models

### Causal Inference
- DAGs
- Potential outcomes
- Instrumental variables

### Model Comparison
- Cross-validation
- Information criteria
- Bayes factors

## Writing Guide for 🐅 CompBayes Papers

### Structure
1. **Question**: What decision/inference problem?
2. **Model**: What probabilistic model captures uncertainty?
3. **Inference**: How do we compute the posterior?
4. **Validation**: How do we check the model?
5. **Decision**: What action follows from inference?

### Language
- Use **probabilistic constructs**: prior, likelihood, posterior, uncertainty
- Emphasize **quantification**: "how much" over "whether"
- Bridge **inference and action**: belief → decision

### Common Mistakes
❌ Model without checking
❌ Point estimates without uncertainty
❌ Ignoring prior sensitivity
❌ No connection to decision
