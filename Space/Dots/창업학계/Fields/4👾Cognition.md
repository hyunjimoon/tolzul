# 👾 Cognition - 인지과학과 계산적 사고

> *"How do we think? How do we compute? How do we decide?"*

## Field Overview

Cognition field는 **계산적 인지과학(Computational Cognitive Science)**과 **의사결정 이론**을 중심으로, 인간과 조직이 어떻게 생각하고 학습하며 결정하는지 연구합니다.

### Core Questions
- How do entrepreneurs recognize opportunities? (인지적 편향과 발견)
- How can we model learning and adaptation? (베이지안 학습)
- What are the resource constraints on rational decision-making? (제한된 합리성)
- How do we formalize problem-solving? (계산적 접근)

### Key Journals
- **Cognitive Science**
- **Psychological Review**
- **Organization Science** (cognition focus)
- **Management Science** (behavioral operations)

## Research Themes

### 1. 🧠 Computational Rationality
**Resource-rational decision making under constraints**

- [[📜👾_gershman15_compute(rationality, resources)]] - Computational rationality framework
- [[📜👾_peng21_overload(information, decisions)]] - Information overload effects

**Core idea**: Human cognition adapts to computational constraints

### 2. 🎲 Bayesian Cognition
**How minds grow and learn through probabilistic inference**

- [[📜👾_tenanbaum11_grow(minds, cognition)]] - Theory of mind growth
- [[📜Goodman07_learning_caus]] - Causal learning
- [[📜tenanbaum14_1sample(1decide)]] - One-shot learning

**Core idea**: Human learning as Bayesian inference

---

### 3. 🎯 Entrepreneurial Cognition
**How entrepreneurs think differently**

- [[📜👾_camuffo19_structure(experiments, learning)]] - Structured experimentation
- [[📜👾_stern24_model(beliefs, experimentation)]] - Belief updating through experiments

**Core idea**: Entrepreneurs as hypothesis testers

---

### 4. 🔬 Experimental Learning
**Learning through experimentation and failure**

Related papers:
- [[📜👾_gans23_choose(entrepreneurship, experimentation)]] - Experimentation in entrepreneurship
- [[📜👾_vul14_one_done]] - One and done learning
- [[📜👾_march91_extract(organizations, small-histories)]] - Learning from small samples

**Core idea**: Small samples, big lessons

---

### 5. 🤖 AI and Formalization
**Automating reasoning and problem formulation**

Related papers:
- [[📜👾_mansinghka25_automate(formalization, programming)]] - Automated formalization
- [[📜👾_xuan24_plan(instruction, cooperation)]] - AI-human cooperation
- [[📜ullman20_conceptualdev]] - Conceptual development

**Core idea**: AI as cognitive collaborator

---

## Methodology Focus

### Experimental Design
- Behavioral experiments
- A/B testing
- Field studies

### Computational Modeling
- Bayesian inference
- Reinforcement learning
- Agent-based models

### Statistical Methods
- Hierarchical models
- Causal inference
- Meta-analysis

## Writing Guide for 👾 Cognition Papers

### Structure
1. **Problem**: What cognitive puzzle are we solving?
2. **Theory**: What computational/cognitive model explains it?
3. **Experiment**: How do we test the theory?
4. **Results**: What did we learn about how minds work?
5. **Implications**: How does this change our understanding?

### Language
- Use **cognitive constructs**: beliefs, attention, memory, learning
- Emphasize **mechanisms**: "how" over "what"
- Bridge **theory and data**: model → prediction → test

### Common Mistakes
❌ Pure description without mechanism
❌ No formal model or computational framework
❌ Ignoring cognitive constraints
❌ Missing the "so what" for decision-making
