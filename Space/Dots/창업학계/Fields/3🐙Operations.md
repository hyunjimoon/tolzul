# 🐙 Operations - 운영관리와 시스템

> *"How to do things right?"*

## Field Overview

Operations field는 **시스템 설계**, **프로세스 최적화**, **의사결정 모델링**을 연구합니다. 사천해전의 학익진처럼, 효율적 시스템과 조화로운 실행이 핵심입니다.

### Core Questions
- How do we optimize complex systems?
- How can we coordinate multiple actors?
- What makes operations efficient and effective?
- How do we manage supply chains and networks?

### Key Journals
- **Management Science**
- **Operations Research**
- **Manufacturing & Service Operations Management**
- **Production and Operations Management**

## Research Themes

### 1. 📦 Inventory and Supply Chain

### 6. 🎲 Prediction and Explanation
**Bridging causal understanding and forecasting**

Related papers:
- [[📜🐙_yarkoni24_integrate(explanation, prediction)]] - Explanation vs prediction
- [[📜🐙_Alvarez_Porac20_imagination_indetermincy_managerial_choice]] - Imagination and choice

## Methodology Focus

### Mathematical Modeling
- Optimization
- Queueing theory
- Game theory

### Simulation
- Discrete event simulation
- Agent-based modeling
- System dynamics

### Empirical Methods
- Field experiments
- Archival data analysis
- Behavioral experiments

## Writing Guide for 🐙 Operations Papers

### Structure
1. **Problem**: What operational challenge are we addressing?
2. **Model**: What mathematical/conceptual model captures it?
3. **Analysis**: What insights emerge from the model?
4. **Validation**: How do we test the model?
5. **Implications**: How does this improve operations?

### Language
- Use **operational constructs**: throughput, utilization, coordination
- Emphasize **tradeoffs**: cost vs speed, efficiency vs flexibility
- Bridge **theory and practice**: model → insight → action

### Common Mistakes
❌ Model without real-world validation
❌ Optimization without constraints
❌ Ignoring behavioral factors
❌ No clear operational implication
