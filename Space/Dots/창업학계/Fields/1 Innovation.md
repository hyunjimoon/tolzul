## Writing Guide for 🐢 Innovation Papers

### Structure
1. **Phenomenon**: What innovation puzzle are we explaining?
2. **Theory**: What framework or mechanism explains it?
3. **Context**: What setting reveals the phenomenon?
4. **Evidence**: How do we support the theory?
5. **Contribution**: How does this advance innovation theory?

### Language
- Use **strategic constructs**: positioning, differentiation, advantage
- Emphasize **mechanisms**: "why" and "how"
- Bridge **theory and practice**: insight → action

### Common Mistakes
❌ Descriptive without theoretical contribution
❌ Ignoring context and contingencies
❌ No clear innovation mechanism
❌ Missing strategic implications
