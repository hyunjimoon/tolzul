Kemell et al. (2020) - "Startup Metrics That Tech Entrepreneurs Need to Know"

**Abstract:** "Metrics can be used by firms to make more objective decisions based on data. Software startups in particular are characterized by the uncertain or even chaotic nature of the contexts in which they operate. Using data in the form of metrics can help software startups to make the right decisions amid uncertainty and limited resources. However, whereas conventional business metrics and software metrics have been studied in the past, metrics in the specific context of software startups have not been studied."

| **Customer**         | Daily Active Users (DAU)        | Users who engage with product daily        | High DAU doesn't predict profitability                     |

| **Customer**         | Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)   | Total revenue from customer relationship   | LTV projections often overestimate actual value            |
| **Customer**         | LTV/CAC Ratio                   | Lifetime value divided by acquisition cost | Ratio doesn't account for payback period                   |
| **Customer**         | Churn Rate                      | Percentage of customers who leave monthly  | Low churn doesn't indicate expansion potential             |
| **Customer**         | Net Promoter Score (NPS)        | Customer satisfaction and loyalty measure  | High NPS doesn't correlate with revenue growth             |

| **Customer**         | Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | Predictable monthly subscription income    | MRR growth doesn't guarantee unit economics                |
| **Customer**         | Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)  | MRR multiplied by 12                       | ARR doesn't account for churn trends                       |
| **Resource Partner** | Burn Rate                       | Monthly cash expenditure rate              | High burn might be growth investment or waste              |
| **Resource Partner** | Revenue Growth Rate             | Percentage increase in revenue over time   | Growth rate doesn't indicate profitability path            |
| **Resource Partner** | Gross Margin                    | Revenue minus cost of goods sold           | High margins don't guarantee scalability                   |

| **Resource Partner** | Market Penetration              | Percentage of target market captured       | Penetration doesn't predict competitive moats              |

## **Key Insight:**

This categorization reveals the **stakeholder optimization dilemma** that [[ðŸ“œCN_parker16_orchestrate(platforms, network-effects)]] identified: entrepreneurs must balance **customer-focused metrics** (engagement, satisfaction, retention) against **resource partner-focused metrics** (growth, profitability, market capture) - but these stakeholder groups often have conflicting success definitions. We expect some controversy but market capture is classified as Resource Partner metrics. Investors, advisors, and strategic partners's acceptance depends more on venture viability and competitive positioning, compared to customers (even including the cases with high network effect).

**The Translation Gap:** Optimizing for customer metrics (like high DAU or NPS) may hurt resource partner metrics (like burn rate or profitability), and vice versa. Entrepreneurs struggle to determine which stakeholder to prioritize at different stages, creating the evaluation complexity problem your framework addresses.
