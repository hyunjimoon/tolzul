Survey of moral philosophy in the Western tradition, focusing primarily on utilitarian, Kantian, and Aristotelian moral theories, along with selected criticisms of those theories. Explores the questions of what makes right actions right and wrong actions wrong, what a good life consists of, what it takes to be a virtuous person, and what it means to be free and responsible for one's actions. Debates why these ideas are important. Aim is to understand how some of the most influential philosophers have addressed these questions, and by so doing, to better understand and formulate one's own views. Readings from classic and contemporary authors, including Aristotle, Bentham, Kant, Rawls, Nagel, and Korsgaard. Enrollment limited.
