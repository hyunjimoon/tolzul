So you want to work for Uber.  
  
I have one question for you.  
  
Are you an asshole?  
  
Sorry, one sec.  
You got a thing?  
  
Quentin has a thing, yeah.  
Addresses the safety issue.  
  
Fuck that. We don't have  
time for safety bullshit.  
  
We got taxi commissions  
across the land  
  
trying to chip our beef.  
  
We got journalists trying  
to infiltrate our shit.  
  
- We got...  
- We got passenger safety issues  
  
- that we need to address...  
- Graves, here,  
  
  
  
is what my mom would  
call a piece of work.  
  
This guy answered a tweet  
that I sent on a whim  
  
looking for a killer.  
  
I made him CEO... for  
about three minutes,  
  
until I realized this  
was a real company.  
  
Then I took the job.  
  
And now he does this and  
that, some important things.  
  
Apparently he's our  
new safety czar.  
  
Safety? Dude, you know how many  
rides we're doing every day.  
  
It's over a million.  
  
No matter how we vet  
these fucking drivers,  
  
there's gonna be a guy  
who had a bad morning,  
  
he got horny, he  
forgot to jerk off,  
  
he makes a pass at a passenger.  
  
  
  
Suddenly that's my fault?  
  
The press makes it out like  
getting in one of our cars  
  
is like walking  
through Times Square  
  
at 2:00 in the morning in 1976.  
  
There's more important  
shit than safety...  
  
TK, you're gonna love my nuts.  
  
It solves the public  
perception problem  
  
and adds to the bottom line.  
  
It's a Safe Rides Fee, TK.  
  
We drop those words in the app,  
add a dollar to every ride.  
  
We can make a...  
  
Like a driver training  
video or something,  
  
and the rest of it...  
  
Wow.  
  
I do love your nuts.  
  
Let me English this shit  
up for those of you too  
  
trusting of a smiling face to  
get the actual fucking drift.  
  
That Safe Rides Fee provides  
one thing and one thing only,  
  
and it ain't a safe  
motherfucking ride.  
  
It's your money in their  
goddamn bank account.  
  
Just because they hide it  
in the fine print of an app  
  
don't mean it ain't a scam.  
  
That is some Michael  
fucking Eisner shit.  
  
Matt, what do you think?  
  
It seems maybe  
misleading. Is that okay?  
  
"Is that okay?" Yeah, dude,  
it's fucking brilliant.  
  
Do you know the  
name Michael Eisner?  
  
It's the guy that ran Disney.  
  
When he first started, parking  
at the theme parks was free.  
  
His first year on the job,  
  
he starts charging  
$1 per car to park,  
  
goes up and up  
and up from there.  
  
People freak the fuck out.  
  
They're, like,  
kicking and screaming  
  
and "This is un-American,"  
but what did they do?  
  
They kept parking at  
fucking Disneyland  
  
because they want to see Goofy.  
  
I mean, they need to see Goofy.  
It's for their kids, right?  
  
We are Goofy, and Minnie  
and fucking Mickey Mouse  
  
all rolled up into one.  
  
Once we get them in our car,  
  
we can charge whatever  
we want to the next time.  
  
You have the green light  
on the Safe Rides Fee.  
  
Dude, that is hundreds  
of millions of dollars,  
  
those three words together.  
  
Nice work.  
  
You didn't answer my  
question from before.  
  
Are you an asshole?  
  
I just... I know that  
look on your face.  
  
You're like, "I think I  
know what I want to say,  
  
but I'm not sure if  
I should say it."  
  
I recognize that  
look. You know why?  
  
Because before all of this,  
  
it was on my face too.  
  
What do you think? Gray or...  
  
Gray?  
  
They called it charcoal  
when I bought it.  
  
- Looks gray to me.  
- Okay.  
  
I really don't think you can go  
wrong within the three shades  
  
of the color palette  
you're debating.  
  
How is it?  
  
- Mm-mm.  
- What?  
  
So, what do you know?  
  
- About Bill Gurley?  
- Mm-hmm.  
  
Well, Benchmark is one of  
the top venture capital firms  
  
in the whole valley.  
  
If they invest in  
us, we are minted.  
  
If they pass, then we  
stink like roadkill.  
  
And Bill Gurley is  
the shot caller.  
  
Shot caller.  
  
He's actually  
literally a baller.  
  
Literally a baller.  
  
- Played in college.  
- You gonna talk sports with him?  
  
I think he'd be more into  
his Valley highlight reel.  
  
Don't you think?  
  
- Uh, eBay?  
- Yeah, exactly.  
  
They put in six  
and a half million.  
  
Oof. What's it worth now? Four?  
  
Five billion.  
  
Yeah, if Benchmark  
comes in on UberCab,  
  
- we are...  
- Minted. You said.  
  
- Yeah, yeah.  
- You get upped.  
  
- They open the books.  
- Made.  
  
This has got to work.  
  
I don't know, though.  
  
He's just gonna see a  
guy in his lame jeans  
  
and these fucking shoes.  
  
I don't know what  
these shoes are.  
  
Nah, he'll see you're  
a dun-colored mare.  
  
- What?  
- From Raise High the Roof Beam?  
  
Salinger. Don't worry,  
you'll read it later.  
  
What it means is your  
ideas will matter.  
  
Not your clothes.  
He'll see that.  
  
What are you doing tonight?  
  
Reading up on this  
new cancer drug  
  
before I get ready  
to take it public.  
  
I'm just gonna throw this  
guy so much attitude,  
  
he won't even pay  
attention to the clothes.  
  
Don't be the Winston Wolf  
cool version of Travis.  
  
Be open.  
  
Show him that you're vulnerable,  
  
and need his money  
and his protection.  
  
- This could be the one, Bill.  
- Could be.  
  
Leaves a lot of room for the  
other side of that wager, Bill.  
  
Is that where you land, Fenton?  
  
Just a little less  
bullish than he is.  
  
We're talking about  
committing millions of dollars  
  
and our reputational  
capital on this guy.  
  
To his product. And  
it is a great product.  
  
Yep, UberCab is solid.  
  
Tech could really be something.  
  
And we like this space.  
  
But why not Cabulous  
or Taxi Magic?  
  
How do we know this Kalanick  
guy is the chosen one?  
  
So we got point.  
What's counterpoint?  
  
He's the counterpoint. I  
made the original point.  
  
Look, Bill, something is  
going to pop in the space.  
  
- This guy's reputation...  
- You know how it goes with me.  
  
Travis and I start completing  
each other's sentences, well...  
  
Look, a unicorn will take  
flight in this sector.  
  
Someone will make a hundred-X  
return on their investment.  
  
But is this Travis guy the kind  
of person who can ride one?  
  
I'll just be like one of those  
sheriffs in the Westerns.  
  
Stand back six paces and  
stare him right in the eyes.  
  
And shoot him?  
  
You know, at Benchmark Capital,  
we don't shoot founders.  
  
We leave that to Sequoia.  
  
Here he is.  
  
Mr. Gurley.  
  
Just Bill.  
  
Everybody's got the  
numbers on the company,  
  
so I'm not gonna  
grill you on that.  
  
All that studying for nothing.  
  
But I do want to understand  
how it is that you see yourself  
  
growing into the role of CEO.  
  
Not every founder can.  
  
First day out of high school,  
  
LeBron James had a  
meeting at Reebok.  
  
He took the bus there.  
It's all he could afford.  
  
And he was sitting  
at the longest  
  
conference table in  
the world with the CEO.  
  
And they're talking,  
and LeBron notices,  
  
oh, the CEO's starting  
to write something.  
  
And then the CEO gets up  
  
and he walks the length  
of this whole table,  
  
and he drops a check in  
front of him for $10 million.  
  
Now, it's only the  
two of them in there,  
  
and, uh, LeBron's only 18.  
  
And the way he tells it, he  
almost took the check, right?  
  
He almost started crying.  
  
It was everything he ever  
worked for in his life  
  
just suddenly made  
manifest in front of him.  
  
But he didn't.  
  
He stood up and he walked out.  
  
Strong move.  
  
Yeah, the man understood  
his value, right?  
  
And eventually, he  
signed for much more  
  
with the place he  
wanted to be: Nike.  
  
But first, he had to ride  
the bus a few more times  
  
to get to the  
Bentleys and the PJs.  
  
But you're not walking out.  
  
No.  
  
Because you're not just some VC.  
  
You're Nike.  
  
And I know it.  
  
You know, maybe we don't  
sell each other tonight.  
  
Just...  
  
We just talk a bit.  
  
If I were selling you,  
you'd have your wallet out.  
  
No, I'm... I'm...  
  
I'm here in the  
spirit of connection.  
  
And in that spirit,  
I'll tell you,  
  
I believe I have underachieved  
in my potential as a leader.  
  
But if I had a  
mentor, like you...  
  
there is no limit to  
where this thing could go.  
  
How do you think your  
drivers would describe  
  
their relationship  
with the company?  
  
There we've done it  
right. Our drivers...  
  
- Are your army.  
- That's what I was gonna say.  
  
Our army. And I believe an  
army with a full belly...  
  
Is an army that can win. Yes.  
  
Yes, sir, and that part,  
  
it's not just  
self-serving either.  
  
It's a big part of the  
whole motivation for me.  
  
I really believe this  
service can be a true value,  
  
can be so good for  
so many people,  
  
so many groups of people.  
  
Ever since the very beginning,  
  
from the first time  
I had the idea.  
  
Well, from...  
  
um, from when Garrett  
Camp and I had the idea.  
  
I bet.  
  
We were in Paris  
  
at the top of the Eiffel Tower.  
  
And I remember it just  
came to me in a burst.  
  
I saw a way to upend  
the wage slavery  
  
of the taxi business.  
  
You know, to democratize  
the entire industry  
  
for the good of those  
hardworking drivers  
  
as well as for the passengers.  
  
I saw it all from above.  
  
A new form of  
transportation, yes,  
  
but also a way for people to  
make it on their own terms.  
  
You know, a mom  
who can just work  
  
while her kids are at school,  
  
or a dad who can  
turn off the app  
  
when it's time  
for family dinner.  
  
So, yeah, that's the basic idea.  
  
It's people driving people.  
A car always within minutes.  
  
A private chauffeur, but  
only when you need it.  
  
So the cost is minimal.  
  
A real disruptor  
for the taxi space.  
  
I just need an operations  
type to run it,  
  
and there's no one  
better than you.  
  
Yeah, you might... You  
might have something.  
  
A lot of work to make  
that real, though.  
  
A lot of work.  
  
And Garrett contributed  
a lot too, absolutely.  
  
Well, it's good of  
you to make sure  
  
that he shares in the credit.  
  
Of course, yeah.  
No, you got to.  
  
Right?  
  
But at that point,  
it was just a matter  
  
of getting the angel investors  
onboard and, you know,  
  
when they saw how sticky  
this product is...  
  
What do you say we get  
into the real questions?  
  
Sure.  
  
Are you willing to work  
with the outside money?  
  
Listen to wise counsel?  
  
I will always listen,  
and I'll take good ideas.  
  
But I will never take orders.  
  
I can't.  
  
Good.  
  
I don't give orders.  
  
Good.  
  
What else do you need to know?  
  
How sticky is it?  
  
Really.  
  
If someone rides twice,  
we have them for life.  
  
That's some evening.  
  
I might've had a  
one-few too many.  
  
I think I might leave  
my car here tonight.  
  
Hey, taxi!  
  
You know, I have a solution  
for this particular problem.  
  
Now, these things rebooted  
everything, right?  
  
And...  
  
What, you just...?  
  
Yeah, like magic.  
  
Travis?  
  
Very nice.  
  
You moved to the  
city after Scour?  
  
Yeah. That was my...  
My first startup.  
  
Peer-to-peer media file sharing.  
  
That didn't turn out?  
  
No, it didn't.  
  
Because of Mike Ovitz.  
  
You shopped the fucking deal.  
  
In the world I come from,  
that name made titans weak.  
  
Now, Silicon Valley  
gets to deal with him.  
  
You refused to close  
terms for months.  
  
You said you were gonna invest,  
but the money never came.  
  
We were bleeding  
out, so eventually,  
  
I had to go looking for  
other sources of funding,  
  
and then you fucking sued?  
  
That's what you do when  
you're getting screwed.  
  
You're getting screwed?  
  
You sued your own company  
so it would take your money,  
  
but it's money you  
didn't want to give.  
  
A child can never understand  
the motives of a man.  
  
Just as the samurai can  
never question his lord.  
  
You know to this day, in Japan,  
  
if a salaryman screws  
up at work, he says,  
  
"I offer to cut my belly open."  
  
They own their mistakes.  
  
They don't blame their betters.  
  
I am not, and I will  
never be, a salaryman.  
  
That's true.  
  
Salarymen at least, uh,  
have a steady income.  
  
Yeah, they also live by  
a code which you do not.  
  
I mean, you leaked the story,  
and now no one will touch us.  
  
You drove a fucking stake  
through the heart of this...  
  
That's right.  
  
And it'll just go  
on and on, boyo,  
  
until you have no choice  
but to sell it for parts.  
  
Nobody shops a  
deal on Mike Ovitz.  
  
And when you look  
back on it all,  
  
you'll only have  
yourself to blame.  
  
You're just gonna  
let the car go?  
  
How are you gonna get home?  
You're not sleeping here are ya'?  
  
No, I'll just get another one.  
  
It's easy.  
  
Boss doesn't pay? How  
does that work for morale?  
  
I'm paid in full. It's a frictionless  
experience for every passenger.  
  
Credit card's on file. You just get  
out of the car, get on with your life.  
  
It should feel like it's  
free. It's just easy.  
  
Tip?  
  
No, our rev share is so good,  
our drivers don't need tips.  
  
Hell.  
  
Bill, I just want to tell you  
  
I am not going to  
lose my company  
  
from the inside ever again.  
  
You can rest easy,  
because at Benchmark...  
  
Yeah. You don't fire founders.  
  
There we go finishing  
each other's sentences.  
  
So are we doing this?  
  
You need my money, right?  
  
I don't need shit.  
  
I'm gonna take this thing the  
whole way with or without you.  
  
Well then, you do it without me.  
  
You don't need to do that.  
  
I see you.  
  
I get there's no  
company without you.  
  
So about my money?  
  
I would like it, yes.  
  
Yeah, one last question.  
  
Threshold.  
  
This whole private cab thing...  
  
in the long run...  
  
it's gonna be declared legal?  
  
Bet your ass.  
  
All right, that wasn't  
the last question.  
  
This is:  
  
The W always has  
cabs waiting outside.  
  
You paid them not to  
be around, didn't you?  
  
What the hell do you think?  
  
But you, you weren't really as  
drunk as you let on, were you?  
  
-What the hell do you think?  
  
I think...  
  
you're my new VC.  
  
That's what I think too.  
  
Guys, big news.  
  
Bill Gurley and  
Benchmark is an investor.  
  
Okay.  
  
Well, that sounds...  
That's good, right?  
  
- Dad, like I just got signed by the Dodgers.  
- Hey, hey!  
  
Don't touch me, I'm too hot. You're  
gonna burn yourself. Like that!  
  
-Okay, mister.  
  
How about a hug hello  
before you start braying?  
  
He's excited.  
  
You used to get that way  
when you closed a huge sale.  
  
That's why you  
were such a killer.  
  
Well, I just want him to know  
that he does not have to have  
  
good news to come and visit.  
  
We're happy to see you anytime.  
  
And we miss you.  
  
Okay.  
  
But, Trav, you are a killer.  
  
-Just like your mama.  
  
This is... no, it's really  
big. It's a big deal.  
  
Yeah, the press is gonna have to  
write something nice about you  
  
for a change.  
  
Uh-huh. Yeah, maybe  
not yet, but they will.  
  
Sounds good, though.  
  
So how much of a piece  
does this guy get?  
  
His company gets a chunk,  
but the valuation goes up.  
  
And I'm still the  
majority owner, Dad.  
  
How's Angie? How  
come she's not here?  
  
Well, she, um...  
  
- Hey.  
- What's up, big bro?  
  
How you doing, Cory?  
  
Heard the next  
Zuckerberg was in town,  
  
- so I figured I'd come say hi.  
- You say that with a tone of  
  
sarcasm, but I bet  
Randi Zuckerberg didn't.  
  
That's why she got that  
big chunk of preferred  
  
in the friends and family round.  
  
My piece is locked.  
  
Is it? Are you sure?  
  
- Trav!  
- What? Me? Him?  
  
The fuck did I do?  
  
Fine, I'll be your  
doting sister.  
  
I'll knit you a hoodie,  
so you look just like him.  
  
Why don't we just  
let it die, okay?  
  
Sure thing, Zuck.  
  
All right, enough.  
  
You know, your brother  
just cut a big deal  
  
to bankroll his company.  
  
- What, the cab thing?  
- It's a capital investment.  
  
It's not a bankroll.  
There's a difference.  
  
- Congrats, Trav. Sounds good.  
- Thank you.  
  
You know, Cory's  
kicking butt too.  
  
Cory, show him the thing.  
  
- Uh, no, it's silly.  
- Oh, come on.  
  
- All right.  
- What's that, a body cam?  
  
Yeah, the squad got  
them from the company,  
  
and we mounted them to  
our helmets last shift.  
  
Look, look at that.  
  
Oh, the poor little  
thing looks dead.  
  
No, look, it's coming around.  
  
A real American hero, huh?  
  
Yeah, how cool that both  
of my boys are kicking ass.  
  
Yeah. You show that clip  
to the ladies, watch out.  
  
Oh, what would you know  
about that, Donald?  
  
-I used to.  
  
All right.  
  
Breakfast is ready.  
  
Oh, Cory, do me a favor.  
  
Give me a copy of that clip.  
I'd love to show it at work.  
  
Yeah, you should  
send it to me too.  
  
I'm gonna show it to  
people and be like,  
  
"I know that guy."  
  
That's what a  
supportive brother does.  
  
Good, you can get in on the  
friends and family sloppy joes  
  
- down the station.  
- Sweet.  
  
Cory, Trav,  
  
we have one family breakfast  
  
every three months  
at this point.  
  
Could we maybe chill  
on the cage match?  
  
We have hardly seen you lately.  
  
Where is my son hiding you?  
  
- We've been busy.  
- You work too hard.  
  
That's the problem with  
you Silicon Valley types.  
  
Are you sure that you're  
taking care of you  
  
and not just him?  
  
You know, he can be  
pretty consuming.  
  
Yes, I know. I'm okay. Really.  
  
- You sure?  
- Mm-hmm.  
  
Welcome to the Rider  
Appreciation Party.  
  
I am legit super pumped  
to be here tonight  
  
and to be part of this company.  
  
You know, I wish...  
  
I would be so happy  
  
if I could just make all  
of your lives frictionless.  
  
Right? Can you imagine,  
like, if you wanted a raise,  
  
and you didn't even have to  
say anything to your boss,  
  
you just look at him  
and boom, there it was.  
  
-You know what I mean?  
  
Or like if you wanted a  
date, just swipe right  
  
and there's the other party in  
your room, down for whatever.  
  
Right?  
  
-Now, unfortunately,  
  
I cannot control all of these  
experiences, or not yet.  
  
But what I can control  
is the experience  
  
of getting from one end of  
town to the other end of town  
  
with no hassle on either end.  
  
You're in, you're out.  
  
You don't have to touch  
your cash or your wallet  
  
or your credit  
card or the driver.  
  
So drink up,  
  
because DUIs are a  
thing of the past!  
  
Great time, you guys!  
  
Hey, thanks.  
  
- That was so good.  
- Oh, thank you.  
  
Where's Cory?  
  
He, uh...  
  
Wow! Okay. I'm... I'm  
gonna get some air.  
  
- You want me to...?  
- No. No, it's all right.  
  
If you wanted Cory here,  
  
you could have  
invited him directly.  
  
I invited all you guys.  
  
Don't make everything a test.  
  
It shouldn't fucking have to be.  
  
You're doing it all wrong, son.  
  
You don't recognize me?  
  
My name's on some  
correspondences  
  
that will put you  
out of business.  
  
Oh. You're Pearson?  
  
The transportation  
guy for the city.  
  
Pearson. Randall  
Pearson, that's right.  
  
And I'm telling you,  
you're fucking up.  
  
You know,  
  
I've heard that so  
much in my life.  
  
I should get it tattooed on  
my ass and take a picture,  
  
make it my profile photo.  
  
But you know what  
I'm gonna do instead?  
  
I'm gonna keep  
building my company,  
  
and then you can get  
an ass tattoo that says  
  
"Travis Kalanick is a  
better man than me."  
  
No tattoos for me, thanks.  
  
'Cause I have some  
personal pride.  
  
- Do you? Working where you work?  
- Listen, Travis,  
  
let's try and act sane  
for maybe five minutes  
  
like a couple of  
goddamn grownups?  
  
I represent some very  
powerful individuals  
  
in the taxi and livery business.  
  
People who don't take too kindly  
  
to their drivers being stolen.  
  
Even less so when  
it's their customers.  
  
You know, as the head of the San  
Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency,  
  
your mandate is to  
represent the public,  
  
not powerful individuals.  
  
Yeah, well, the public interest  
is served by having available  
  
and inexpensive  
taxicabs readily av...  
  
Uh-huh.  
  
Look, Travis,  
  
this can go so hard for you.  
  
Buried in fines, lawsuits, jail.  
  
Or you can win huge with me.  
  
Give them your tech.  
  
Put it in their cars,  
in their fucking taxis.  
  
Join forces.  
  
They'll make it  
real sweet for you.  
  
You'll end up controlling  
so many medallions.  
  
They'll be jingling in your  
pockets like loose change.  
  
I think this must have  
been what it was like  
  
when Homo sapiens were  
running around together  
  
with Neanderthals.  
  
You're asking me to trade my  
fire for your fucking club.  
  
No, thanks.  
  
You're making a big mistake.  
  
I'll put that on  
my other ass cheek.  
  
Yeah, no, I get it.  
No the thing is,  
  
When I say I get it,  
that means I get it.  
  
Okay.  
  
This is the kid you're  
interviewing for the job.  
  
Great. Pull up a chair.  
  
Here is my question for you.  
  
Are you an asshole?  
  
Sorry.  
  
- Are you the CEO?  
- I am.  
  
This is an order  
to cease and desist  
  
all taxi and livery operations.  
  
- You arresting me?  
- Not at this time, sir.  
  
But if you continue in  
violation of city ordinance,  
  
we'll be back.  
  
This is bad, TK.  
  
- This is a cease...  
- We're not ceasing.  
  
- And desist...  
- We're not desisting either.  
  
- It threatens up to...  
- Yeah, I see.  
  
There's penalties.  
  
Up to $5,000 per instance  
of UberCabs operation.  
  
"Instance" meaning each ride.  
  
Ninety days in jail per day  
  
the company remains in  
operation past the order.  
  
That's me in jail?  
  
Yeah, that's you in jail, man.  
  
Anything you could sign  
so it's you instead of me?  
  
Jesus, no.  
  
I... I mean, I can... No...  
  
I'm fucking kidding, Gil.  
Don't worry about it.  
  
But I am more  
Emerson than Thoreau.  
  
I do not want to go to jail.  
  
Hey, everybody!  
  
You heard about this already?  
  
I want you to know this...  
  
truncheon of the crooked  
establishment, this object of fear,  
  
I want you to know this  
is not our death warrant.  
  
This is our goddamn  
birth certificate, okay?  
  
This means we are  
alive in this world,  
  
and we are growing the fuck up.  
  
It's a sign of validation.  
  
And it's a sign  
that we are scaring  
  
the taxi and livery industry,  
  
and the transportation agency,  
  
and the status quo shitless.  
  
This is validation...  
  
of our standing as...  
  
disruptors.  
  
Austin, how's it going  
with our future drivers?  
  
You're getting them?  
  
Got a bunch.  
  
Did you settle with the city?  
  
Oh, no, no, we're not  
settling with the city.  
  
We are taking this city!  
  
-Are you sure, TK?  
  
You know what they say  
about fighting city hall.  
  
See, this is the thing  
about changing the world.  
  
The world never wants to change.  
  
It's gonna dig in its  
heels and tell you no  
  
and try to crush you.  
  
Fortunately for us, we are in  
the world-changing business.  
  
At least I am. I  
was built for this!  
  
They want to fight?  
Oh, I love to fight.  
  
You want to know  
who wins fights?  
  
Whoever wants it more.  
  
And who do you think  
wants this more?  
  
Them?  
  
Or me?  
  
Let's fucking go!  
  
Come on!  
  
Let's fucking go!  
  
Let's fucking go!  
  
Penny, get me a  
meeting with the mayor  
  
and order more iPhones.  
  
We need to ratchet up  
enlisting more drivers.  
  
Made me wise  
  
But I'm not About to give thanks  
  
Or apologize  
  
Shape up, boys.  
  
I need five minutes.  
Nah, fuck that.  
  
You need the five minutes  
that I'm about to give you.  
  
What is this, huh?  
  
We don't have time.  
  
Of course you don't have time...  
  
because you're  
indentured servants...  
  
if you're human at all.  
  
Because really, you're more  
like hamsters on a wheel.  
  
Who are you calling a rodent?  
  
No, no, no.  
  
You're making  
yourselves rodents.  
  
Look, you got to run,  
run, run all day long  
  
just to make enough  
fares to cover your nut  
  
during your shift,  
  
with pissed-off customers  
  
because the commission  
hiked the fares,  
  
or to pay off the loans  
on your medallions,  
  
or the consortiums  
that own the medallions  
  
on the hacks that you drive.  
  
Or to make enough  
from the limo company  
  
so that your piece is enough  
  
so you can afford some food  
pellets and wood shavings  
  
for your cages at  
the end of the week.  
  
Tell me I'm wrong.  
  
So, yeah, you can.  
  
You know, hustle out  
there and get at it.  
  
Or you could stay  
here for five minutes  
  
and hear about  
being your own boss,  
  
and driving with a company  
  
that's gonna change  
your fucking lives.  
  
I could use a change.  
  
Enmity gauged  
  
United by fear  
  
Time to endure  
  
What I could not forgive  
  
We're making progress.  
  
I didn't say you were wrong.  
  
Just what you're  
saying is irrelevant.  
  
Here.  
  
Mayor?  
  
Nothing yet.  
  
Try again.  
  
We don't have to tell you  
just how much in contributions  
  
our clients have made.  
  
No, you don't.  
  
Then you tell us something,  
  
like what you're gonna do,  
  
because right now,  
this goddamn company  
  
is stealing drivers from  
legitimate taxi and livery.  
  
It's chipping away  
at a legacy business.  
  
There are two jobs  
you want in this city:  
  
the mayor's and mine.  
  
I'm like Robert Moses in  
The Old Man in Chinatown.  
  
You really think I'm  
gonna let some tech weasel  
  
grab my dick like a baton,  
  
twirl it around in  
Golden Gate Park?  
  
What's your next step then?  
  
What are you going  
to do? Question mark.  
  
What I'm gonna do is drop  
a thermonuclear device  
  
right on top of their heads.  
  
The San Francisco Municipal  
Transportation Agency has those?  
  
Close enough.  
  
Right now, I expect a  
duck-and-cover drill  
  
taking place over  
there at UberCab,  
  
right before the mushroom  
cloud turns them all into dust.  
  
Tough to have a car service  
without any fucking drivers.  
  
All right, what?  
  
What's the emergency?  
  
It's the fucking drivers.  
  
They're defecting.  
  
That's what the  
incentives are for.  
  
- Pay them more.  
- Gil said we can't.  
  
And without those incentives,  
they're leaving in droves.  
  
- They're going back to taxis.  
- That's Randall fucking Pearson.  
  
He's making his last stand.  
  
Gil, why are you cutting  
off the incentives?  
  
Because we don't have  
the money to pay them.  
  
And without drivers, we'll  
never have any fucking money.  
  
- Right?  
- He can't, TK.  
  
We don't have it. Our burn rate  
is bleeding the company dry.  
  
Maybe it's time we make  
a deal with Pearson.  
  
Maybe we do just license our  
tech, combine our forces...  
  
Wait, wait. That's giving  
up. Are you fucking insane?  
  
No, that's not insane.  
That's reality.  
  
Because we're down to smoke  
and mirrors and promises.  
  
I don't know how we're gonna  
keep the lights on next month...  
  
Okay.  
  
Unless we make  
some kind of a deal  
  
- with the taxi commissi...  
- Okay, okay.  
  
Okay.  
  
All right.  
  
We are not that kind of company  
  
that just bends over  
to the status quo.  
  
We fuck the status quo, right?  
  
Now, I'm hearing a lot about  
what surrender looks like.  
  
Looks like me on my knees with  
Pearson pissing in my mouth.  
  
We're not doing that.  
  
Tell me what victory looks like.  
  
Well, I guess we can't, or  
we wouldn't be sitting here.  
  
All right, we're  
gonna take money  
  
from other departments.  
  
We have.  
  
Stop paying the vendors  
just for a minute.  
  
Gurley.  
  
Go to him, ask him  
for another check,  
  
just to ride us out  
through this fight  
  
with San Francisco Transport.  
  
That's the one thing I can't do.  
  
We'd look like fucking idiots.  
  
Or I would.  
  
Like we're failing.  
  
Because we are.  
  
So that's it?  
  
That's all you got for me?  
  
Buy a Powerball ticket. I...  
  
This company, my life,  
  
is on the line here right now,  
  
and you motherfuckers...  
  
Yeah, and all of you too!  
  
You just leave  
everything to me, right?  
  
You just come to work,  
  
and you lounge around with  
your thumbs up your ass.  
  
You don't do anything.  
  
You don't fucking bleed for it.  
  
You're not... You're  
not super pumped.  
  
Hi, Travis.  
  
Hey, Mom.  
  
What's going on?  
  
I was just thinking about Cory.  
  
How do you sleep at night,  
him doing what he does?  
  
Well, once you have kids,  
  
you don't really sleep  
a full night again.  
  
You'll see that one day.  
  
Seriously, though.  
  
Seriously.  
  
This is not about Cory, huh?  
  
Yeah, I know, uh...  
  
I, um...  
  
I yelled.  
  
Aw.  
  
At Angie?  
  
No.  
  
Everybody.  
  
Travis, you can't do that.  
  
- Aw.  
- Yeah, I know.  
  
I don't... I don't know what  
the fuck's wrong with me.  
  
I don't know why  
I keep doing that.  
  
It's just like why can't  
they just watch what I do  
  
and do what I say and...  
  
And believe what I know,  
  
and why can't they  
just fucking trust me?  
  
What did you yell about?  
  
We're up against it.  
  
I thought the company  
was doing great.  
  
It is, kind of,  
  
but there's this thing  
called burn rate,  
  
and, um...  
  
Yeah.  
  
I need more money.  
  
Like, now.  
  
Can you go to a bank?  
  
No. Not for this much, no.  
  
What about your  
investor, Gurley?  
  
You have not asked him?  
  
No. No, I can't go to him.  
  
If I went to him right now,  
  
he would just think  
I was a fuckup.  
  
He'd see these numbers...  
  
and he'd just shut me down  
  
and probably sell  
me off for parts.  
  
Okay, your brother is  
great at the thing he does.  
  
It's a straightforward thing.  
  
Hard to do, easy to  
measure. Your thing isn't.  
  
But you're also great at it.  
  
You brought this Bill Gurley in,  
  
you built a company  
that he liked.  
  
So now, you got to do what  
Cory does with his guys.  
  
You got to treat him like  
you're all on the same team.  
  
You know, tell him what's  
going on and what you need.  
  
What if he says no?  
  
Sometimes, to get what you want,  
you got to give what you want.  
  
You're wondering why  
they don't trust you.  
  
Well, believe me,  
  
they're wondering the  
same thing about you.  
  
Why should Bill Gurley trust  
you if you don't trust him?  
  
The burn rate.  
  
I'm, uh, hesitant  
to talk about it.  
  
I can see that.  
  
Also, I wanted to come here  
  
and have a conversation  
face-to-face about it.  
  
Um, the money we are spending...  
  
Spent, we spent it, I did.  
  
Is to get the  
riders in the car...  
  
All startups that are expanding  
go through serious burn.  
  
What are we dealing with here?  
  
I'm reluctant to  
say the numbers.  
  
Um, here...  
  
Well, Jesus.  
  
I can see why you would  
think that's unsustainable.  
  
Is that what you think?  
  
I think that top sheet's about  
as ugly as a horned toad's ass.  
  
That sounds ugly.  
  
You ever seen a  
horned toad's ass?  
  
Can you picture  
Joakim Noah's jumper?  
  
Fugly. Yeah.  
  
This is like that.  
  
You're wondering whether  
this is the moment  
  
I shoot you or sell  
your company for parts?  
  
Yeah, just hearing  
you say those words...  
  
You know, if I don't  
give you this funding,  
  
the people you work  
with, they're gonna start  
  
updating their résumés and  
they are gonna light out.  
  
Hell, even if I do, they  
probably already started.  
  
So let me ask you, is that you?  
  
Smart, talented guy.  
  
Are you looking for  
a soft spot to land?  
  
Me? No fucking way.  
  
No, this is the hill I die on.  
  
There is no other company  
startup or otherwise for me.  
  
This is all I've got.  
  
Good. What did I tell  
you from the beginning?  
  
No way I sell it out.  
  
-Is that because I'm a good guy?  
  
No. I mean, I am a good guy.  
  
-That's not the reason.  
  
Does the heroin dealer giveaway  
the first taste of his product  
  
out of the goodness  
of his heart for free?  
  
No, he does not.  
  
This is that.  
  
We put as much  
money as we need to  
  
into getting people  
into those cars,  
  
and we got them.  
  
We charge anything we want.  
  
Cigarettes, the best  
business in the world  
  
till people start getting sued  
  
and having to pay  
for the settlements.  
  
But what we're  
doing with UberCab  
  
sure as hell isn't  
giving anyone cancer.  
  
So you're gonna  
keep bankrolling us?  
  
- You're gonna come in for more?  
- Grow or die.  
  
Listen, it wasn't easy, you  
coming in here like this.  
  
I get that.  
  
And I appreciate it.  
  
I respect that.  
  
We're partners.  
  
And you got your check.  
  
Thank you.  
  
I want you to have something.  
  
A full access card.  
  
You come and go at  
UberCab as you please.  
  
You're one of us.  
  
Travis.  
  
This money...  
  
it'll only go so far.  
  
This is the last of it.  
  
You hardly touched  
your bento box.  
  
Yes, I'm sorry.  
  
You usually crush the  
tempura, not even that.  
  
Just not hungry.  
  
You sounded so excited earlier  
  
after talking to Gurley.  
  
Yeah, guess it wore off.  
  
Reality set in.  
  
Why don't you leave  
this here and come home?  
  
- Get a few hours sleep...  
- Nah, sorry.  
  
I'm just gonna stay till I can  
think of a way to take the city.  
  
This is our  
proof-of-concept moment.  
  
You know, last go-round before  
we're out of dry powder,  
  
and the mayor won't  
even talk to me.  
  
Look, you know your history.  
  
And you know people.  
  
Reagan showing strength  
to Gorbachev in Geneva  
  
by going without his coat  
in the freezing cold, right?  
  
Gates promising  
he'd deliver the OS  
  
before he even started it.  
  
Hamilton agreeing to move  
the actual White House.  
  
Power is fluid.  
  
Use that.  
  
Use all of it.  
  
The riders.  
  
They're not just what we need.  
  
They are our power.  
  
We enlist them against  
the politicians.  
  
Get the mayor to talk to me?  
  
No, he's gonna beg  
me to talk to him.  
  
We need to let those  
fuckers in office know  
  
that the voters are with us.  
  
What do you do when you  
get kicked in the balls  
  
by a hobnailed boot?  
  
Roll around and groan?  
  
Well, the motherfuckers  
who run startups,  
  
this motherfucker,  
  
eats it with a smile  
and keeps on going.  
  
I'm at peace, I'm the man  
  
Buying stocks on the  
day Of the crash, yeah  
  
On the loose, I'm a truck  
  
All the rolling hills I'll  
flatten them out, yeah  
  
More petitions coming in.  
  
Uh-huh  
  
It's evolution, baby  
  
There's no top.  
  
We didn't have enough  
to fill the last boxes.  
  
Yeah, but still, that's  
a lot of signatures.  
  
Yeah, but a pyramid  
has to have a point.  
  
Really, TK? Ringers?  
  
- Yeah.  
- What if they check?  
  
Then we become baristas.  
  
Well, shit, I  
already tried that.  
  
Didn't really work out.  
  
Point.  
  
Okay.  
  
You said it loud and clear  
with these petitions.  
  
Now, say it even louder.  
  
Let us ride!  
  
Let us ride! Let us ride!  
  
Let us ride!  
  
The mayor is willing to meet.  
  
Yes.  
  
I'm going in!  
  
Don't worry, I have  
prepped the mayor  
  
as to exactly how we feel  
about your little enterprise.  
  
But at the risk of having you  
  
clutter up our  
offices any further,  
  
I figured I'd say hello.  
  
And a quick goodbye,  
  
because as Mr. Pearson said...  
  
Horseshit.  
  
There were piles of it  
all along the streets  
  
of this fine city, from  
Lombard down to Lincoln Way.  
  
Literally horseshit.  
  
Until the horse and carriage  
got replaced by the streetcar.  
  
You don't think those teamsters  
were bitching back then?  
  
Because they were,  
but John Geary,  
  
the first mayor of this  
town, he saw the future.  
  
And he made it so.  
  
Of course, the future  
doesn't last, right?  
  
And pretty soon, Jitneys  
came into fashion,  
  
which obliterated the cable car,  
  
turned it into a  
tourist attraction.  
  
But that's because the  
mayor then, James Rolph,  
  
he saw that for a nickel,  
  
you could take a Jitney anywhere  
you wanted to go in the city.  
  
As long as you don't mind riding  
along with some other lugs  
  
and stopping wherever  
they want to stop,  
  
which is why the Jitney gave  
way to the buses and the BART,  
  
and of course, taxicabs, right?  
  
Blessed taxis, in which you  
can ride princely and alone  
  
as long as the meter is running.  
  
And as long as the  
medallion owner  
  
and the San Francisco  
Municipal Transportation Agency  
  
takes their bites.  
  
So for a while times were  
fat, and everybody ate.  
  
But just like all those  
other modes of transport,  
  
eventually the dying day comes.  
  
And that is where we are today  
with Mayor Ed Lee in charge,  
  
and now it's his chance  
to glimpse the future,  
  
usher it in,  
  
because this is what  
we are offering.  
  
This is the future of  
passenger traveling  
  
in a private vehicle for a fee  
  
driven by a private  
citizen who earns that fee.  
  
It is winners and commerce on  
both sides of the equation.  
  
The question you have  
to ask yourself is:  
  
Does Mayor Ed Lee wanna go  
down in the history books  
  
as an innovator,  
  
or does he want to let  
these beautiful streets  
  
of San Francisco get flooded  
with horseshit one more time?  
  
Because that is what the SFMTA  
  
and the taxi lobbies  
are peddling.  
  
Horseshit.  
  
The city has been taken!  
  
Great. That's great.  
  
Full stop. But...  
  
Okay, wait, you can't say  
"full stop" and then say "but."  
  
That's...  
  
But what about the fines?  
  
No, dude, the  
mayor loves us now.  
  
He's gonna push legislation  
our way, all right?  
  
Future fines unlikely.  
  
Great. So prior fines?  
  
Pearson was there.  
  
I think he thinks we  
still owe the money.  
  
Oh. What'd he say?  
  
"You still owe the  
fucking money."  
  
Great.  
  
I think this is gonna be a  
great thing for the both of you.  
  
For everybody.  
  
Full access? Nice.  
  
That's the kind of relationship  
I build with all my founders.  
  
If the door isn't open  
to me and vice versa,  
  
something's wrong.  
  
So, what does Travis  
think of this?  
  
We'll find out when I tell him.  
  
Look, if we do  
what you're saying,  
  
- and we pay these fines...  
- Yeah, and if we don't,  
  
we're right back in those  
waters where we drown.  
  
- Okay, well I'm not paying them.  
- Then they're gonna take  
  
the fixtures off the  
ceiling to sell them.  
  
We're in a vise.  
  
Whoop. There it is.  
  
Perfect.  
  
Come on in.  
  
Might as well do this  
  
while we still have  
office furniture.  
  
Sit down. Where  
did we leave off?  
  
You asked me a question  
  
that I didn't have  
a chance to answer.  
  
Great. And what is the answer?  
  
Hey, I understand  
congratulations are in order.  
  
Bill. Yes, they are.  
  
Good to see you.  
  
Who's this?  
  
This is the answer to  
your burn rate problem.  
  
Meet Emil Michael, best  
dealmaker in the valley,  
  
and your new raise wingman.  
  
Now that you've, uh,  
taken over San Francisco,  
  
it's time that we, uh, go  
to the outside investors,  
  
tackle the other cities.  
  
Grow or die, right?  
  
Welcome aboard.  
  
Bill, thank you so much.  
  
Your support is...  
  
It's just always so appreciated.  
  
Anything I can do to help.  
  
Take care.  
  
I'll let you get to it.  
  
What the fuck are you  
really doing here?  
  
You a spy? You  
here to replace me?  
  
Whoa, I'm...  
  
I'm just here to  
help, like Bill said.  
  
Yeah, I've heard  
that bullshit before.  
  
It's not happening  
in my company.  
  
I don't expect you to trust me.  
  
I expect you to test me.  
  
Give me that.  
  
We have to respond to this  
bullshit by end of business,  
  
or else this company that  
you're spying on right now  
  
won't exist anymore.  
  
What do you got? You're  
this big dealmaker.  
  
You make us a deal,  
  
get us out from  
under these fines,  
  
settle us out, pennies  
on the dollar, what?  
  
The San Francisco MTA  
regulates taxicabs.  
  
And so, yeah, UberCab is  
up to its ass in fines  
  
and facing existential threat.  
  
- Gil?  
- Yeah?  
  
UberCab,  
  
and all of its corresponding  
regulatory problems  
  
and liabilities is  
hereby shut down,  
  
inoperative and defunct.  
  
Okay.  
  
Why didn't I think of that?  
  
A crucial question  
for another day, Gil.  
  
So we're not a cab  
company anymore?  
  
You never were.  
  
So no cab regulators can reg us.  
  
Sharp.  
  
Ginsu sharp, yeah.  
  
We are a ride-sharing service.  
  
-They're gonna say that's fraud.  
  
- I mean, it might be fraud.  
- Why?  
  
Because I'm not  
willing to recognize  
  
that some taxi authority  
has jurisdiction over us?  
  
Let them call it fraud  
and you know what?  
  
To the end, Gil, re-paper  
us as a new entity  
  
called Uber.  
  
Uber... what?  
  
Yeah.  
  
Nothing. Just Uber.  
  
When I came into this, I  
was ready to break shit,  
  
because that is what  
revolution requires.  
  
But you know what? I  
forgot that for a second.  
  
But our new friend Emil  
here just reminded me.  
  
- Go.  
- Okay.  
  
I'm supposed to  
say yes, aren't I?  
  
That I'm an asshole.  
  
Well, I am.  
  
I'm an asshole.  
  
That's the right answer.  
  
Because if you're not,  
you'll never make it at Uber.  
  
We should hire this guy up.  
  
Kelsey, can you  
bring him to Gil?  
  
Make sure he signs an NDA.  
  
Congratulations.  
  
Go.  
  
All right, bro, are you ready?  
  
'Cause next, we're taking  
New York, and then Paris,  
  
then Berlin, then  
Mumbai, and then Tokyo,  
  
and then rest of  
the fucking world.  
  
Then we take Berlin  
  
I'm guided by a signal  
  
In the heavens  
  
I'm guided by This birthmark  
  
On my skin  
  
I'm guided by the beauty  
  
Of our weapons  
  
First we take Manhattan  
  
Then we take Berlin  
  
I'd really like to  
live Beside you, baby
