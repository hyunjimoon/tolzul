		As Time per Task approaches zero, cross sell revenue also declines to zero \
		(there is no time to cross sell). At the reference value of time per task \
		equal to 1, average cross sell is also at its normal value of 1. As time \

		approach the time per task limits more slowly towards the extremes of \
		schedule pressure than when schedule pressure first deviates from normal.
