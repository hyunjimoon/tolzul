	~	Dmnl
	~	Average cross selling revenue per task depends on the time spent per task. \
		As Time per Task approaches zero, cross sell revenue also declines to zero \
		(there is no time to cross sell). At the reference value of time per task \
		equal to 1, average cross sell is also at its normal value of 1. As time \
		per task increases, revenue from cross selling increases as well, but more \
		slowly as it approaches a theoretical maximum of four times the normal \
		value (assumed based on Fig.1)

	~	Dmnl
	~	We assume that tasks can take slightly longer if schedule pressure is low, \
		and that tasks can take slightly less time if schedule pressure is high. \
		The reference point is that when schedule pressure is normal (1), time per \
		task should be normal. We assume an s-shaped curve because employees will \
		approach the time per task limits more slowly towards the extremes of \
		schedule pressure than when schedule pressure first deviates from normal.
