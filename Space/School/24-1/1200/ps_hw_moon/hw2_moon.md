3 Problem 3 - Queueing Problem II 

1. state space is the number of queue, transition diagram is markov chain (mu, )

2. stable: rho = l/m <1

The system reaches a steady state when the probability that the system has a certain number of vehicles at one time point is the same as the probability that the system has the same number of vehicles at the next time point. The queue can be stable if ρ < 1, that is,vehicles arrive at a rate lower than the service rate k µ .

3. global balance system for steady state prob dbn

The average number of trucks in the system is $\bar{N}$: ![[../../../../../../ref/Pasted image 20230310093325.png]]
The average number of trucks in the queue is:
