hi garud, there is a word called 달콤씁쓸 in korean. it is bitter sweet in english, but in fact it's the order is changed so it's sweet bitter.

i hope technologies could help us separate the bad memories from good memories in the same era. 

memories of jokes we exchanged with minhwan and you, looking forward to work with you are what i'd take to my grave but it always comes with the painful other memories of that summer, which i feel 

last year when my friends called columbia as my alma martar, i don't know how to process this information. 

what leaves in me and the value it creates. 

i define optimism as favorable expectation for future events. cruel optimism

what i'm sure is, you as a person will always leave in me as warmth.
