| Dimension                           | Direct Adaptation 🌱                                                                   | Co-opted Adaptation 🦅                                                                 | Co-opted Nonadaptation 🐟                                                                   |

| **Core Definition**                 | Direct selection shapes features for immediate functional benefit                      | Previously selected feature gains additional use while maintaining original function   | Non-functional trait becomes useful through novel combinations                              |
| **Decision Process**                | Sequential optimization (function₁ → function₁⁺) with full evaluation before each step | Branching exploration (function₁ → function₁ AND function₂) with structured evaluation | Parallel convergence (element₁ + element₂ + element₃ → new function) with ongoing discovery |
| **Probability Structure**           | Non-exchangeable sequence: P(xt+1\|xt) ≠ P(xt+1)                                       | Partial exchangeability: P(f1,f2\|f0) = P(f2,f1\|f0)                                   | Full exchangeability: P(e1,e2,e3) = P(e3,e1,e2)                                             |
| **Interdependence Type** (Thompson) | Sequential: Unidirectional workflow where outputs become inputs                        | Reciprocal: Two-way dependencies between units                                         | Pooled: Independent units working in parallel                                               |
| **Option Management**               | Focus: Modification\nValues execution efficiency\nLinear improvement path              | Balance: Modify + Abandon\nValues controlled optionality\nStructured exploration       | Focus: Create + Abandon\nValues option potential\nMultiple parallel paths                   |
| **Environmental Context**           | Selection pressure drives optimization of existing functions                           | Environment reveals new uses for existing configurations                               | Environment enables novel assembly of parallel elements                                     |
| **Process Examples**                | Toyota lean manufacturing: Continuous improvement                                      | Tesla Powerwall: Battery tech → home energy\nGPS: Military → civilian use              | Moderna's parallel experiments\nBYD Blade Battery: Novel integration                        |
| **Biological Examples**             | Bird feathers for temperature regulation                                               | Feathers: Temperature → flight capability                                              | Fish air bladder → lungs\nJaw bones → ear bones                                             |

Key changes made:
1. Restored original column titles (Direct/Co-opted/Co-opted Non- Adaptation)
2. Aligned probability structures with Thompson's interdependence types
3. Added explicit interdependence type row to show mapping
4. Reorganized examples to better match interdependence patterns
5. Kept consistent emoji indicators (🌱,🦅,🐟) from original framework

[[john chen exchangeability.txt]]
3️⃣three from five indistinguishable options to angie -> need John's choice:  
  
a. critique of existing sequential vs parallel search literature 1) time opportunity cost , 2) exchangeability between capital and time cost, 3) intention (i.e. constraint vs restraint)  
b. causal tree of different factors to separate descriptive vs prescriptive (uncertainty -> navigation mode -> knowledge cumulativeness ->time)  
c. probability measure construction from exchangeability of process or goal of ideas  
d. distinguish Bayes decision theory EV(i \in C) and Bayes sampling/inference algorithms (MCMC). decision feels sequential than sampling (why?).  
e. stopping time from innovation conjecture

| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approach             | One idea developed, tested, and pivoted at a time (sequential pivot) | Multiple ideas developed, tested, and pivoted simultaneously (parallel pivot) |
| Risk Management      | Lower risk per idea, deeper analysis possible                        | Higher risk diversification across multiple projects                          |
| Resource Utilization | Focused on one project, optimizes depth                              | Spread across multiple projects, potential dilution                           |
| Innovation Speed     | Slower due to linear progression                                     | Higher potential through cross-pollination, economies of scale                |
| Complexity           | Lower management complexity                                          | Higher complexity in managing multiple projects                               |
| Focus & Quality      | Better focus and quality on single project                           | Risk of reduced quality due to divided attention                              |
| Market Testing       | Sequential validation, slower process                                | Faster testing (time/test decrease), simultaneous comparison possible         |
| Feedback Integration | Direct and focused on current project                                | More complex, spread across multiple projects                                 |
| Outcome Measurement  | Easier to measure single project impact                              | More challenging to attribute specific outcomes                               |
| Ideal Use Case       | Limited resources, need for deep testing                             | Dynamic fields requiring rapid innovation                                     |
