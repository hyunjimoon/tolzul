Galileo Galilei died the same winter Isaac Newton was born (1642). Albert Einstein was born the same date Newton died (March 31).

Joy was killed but there were meaningful rebirths (2024 Dec 20).

I tried to address Charlie's critique in the attached.

JB, may I carefully propose that I put my name first in the author list?
1. As I shared, I'm using this as Josh's class project and being listed first will prevent unfortunate misunderstanding that i didn't put due effort in.
2. I'll be more motivated to publicize this work, get feedback, and invite collaborators. This will positively affect your long term goal of maximizing h-index. 
3. I'm very sure I'll be remorseful (even in my funeral) if I don't share this desire with you, even if other reasoning that we both agree exists so this proposal gets rejected :)

And at the end, we show that this whole process from left to right is risk taking, that is measurable, that is confronted to a fundamental uncertainty, which are like markets, people, choices and desires, and it's this kind of opposition we show here, and this is why we put also at the end, market one, market two, because depending on the products you are making and the market reception, you will have different kind of feedback for these Two, like the big red arrows that go back. So it's a bit complex, but I hope it makes sense to you that, because you know the double diamond, and now we try to systematize it in a way," |

key tradeoff: three components of inductive bias where learning (approximation bias (how many features can be provided) and statistical (objective function))-earning (optimization bias) tradeoff

1. based on [charlie-jb🗣️](https://otter.ai/s/OCYihPD2SLaMO7nriQ5m1g?snpt=true), where Charlie was testing if exaptation was "natural evolution" while spandrel was "conscious entrepreneurship." JB corrected this by explaining that both are natural evolutionary processes, but they differ in their mechanism (🪶Exaptation: Refines existing functions through selective pressure VS 🏛️Spandrel: Creates new functions from structural byproducts, not from selective pressure) my prior updated from [prior comparison on 🪶Exaptation vs 🏛️Spandrel] to [posterior comparison on 🪶Exaptation vs 🏛️Spandrel].

The updated table better reflects that both are evolutionary processes but differ in their relationship to selective pressure and functional origins.

| Topic | Key Points | Examples & Discussion |

| Exaptation | - Evolution of previous function<br>- Sequential refinement of adaptation<br>- Mutation analogy | JB: Bird wings evolved from thermal regulation to flight<br>- Porsche "Turbo" brand from combustion to EV |
| Spandrel | - Creation of new function<br>- Parallel combination of features<br>- Unintended benefits | JB: BYD's blade battery shape: safety feature became brand signature<br>- Architectural dome spaces becoming decorative |
| Learning Model | - Evolution from LELE to LLLLE<br>- Time costs impact testing approach<br>- Updating priors through action | Charlie: Dress example - length/color tests inform next experiment<br>- Angie: Like LLM token weighting with user feedback |
