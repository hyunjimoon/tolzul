### 1. That Vagueness is a Feature of _High-Performing_ Startups, Not Just "Lemons"

**The Context from the Chat:**  
Scott Stern repeatedly pushed back on the idea of "vagueness." He argued from a classic Economics standpoint (Signaling Theory): Why would a good company want to be vague? Usually, vagueness is "cheap talk"—something low-quality companies do to hide their flaws. He struggled to see why a high-quality entrepreneur wouldn't just tell the truth about their excellent strategy.

**The Surprise:**  
It would surprise Scott to see empirical evidence or a formal model proving that **the best startups are intentionally vague to preserve "Option Value."**

- **Why it surprises Scott:** He assumes "truth-telling" is the optimal strategy for good companies.
- **The Argument:** If Angie can prove that being specific forces a startup to "lock in" a strategy too early (creating an "inventory" of promises they can't change), then vagueness becomes a rational economic tool for managing uncertainty. It shifts vagueness from being a sign of _ignorance_ (I don't know what I'm doing) to a sign of _prudence_ (I am keeping my options open until the market reveals itself).

### 2. That "Inventory Theory" (The News Vendor Model) Explains Narrative Construction

**The Context from the Chat:**  
Charlie Fine is an Operations Management scholar. He understands the "News Vendor Model" (balancing the cost of having too much inventory vs. too little) in the context of physical goods—widgets, car parts, clothes. During the chat, both professors struggled to connect the "math" of inventory to the "soft skills" of pitching a story. They questioned if the analogy actually holds up.

**The Surprise:**  
It would surprise Charlie to see a rigorous demonstration that **words in a pitch deck behave exactly like perishable inventory.**

- **Why it surprises Charlie:** He is used to applying this logic to supply chains, not psychology or linguistics.
- **The Argument:** Angie needs to show that entrepreneurs face the exact same trade-offs as a supply chain manager:
    - **Underage Cost (Too Vague):** If you don't promise enough, investors "walk away" (lost sales).
    - **Overage Cost (Too Specific):** If you promise too much specific detail, and the market pivots, you are stuck with "obsolete inventory" (a strategy that no longer works).
    - **The Shock:** Proving that _narrative_ has a holding cost and a spoilage rate just like physical inventory.

### 3. That Funding _Reduces_ Flexibility (The "Resource Curse" of Pivoting)

**The Context from the Chat:**  
There was a significant discussion about the relationship between money and pivoting. The standard intuition (often held by Strategy scholars like Scott) is that **Money = Time**. If you have more money, you have more runway, which means you have more time to experiment and pivot. Therefore, more money should lead to _more_ flexibility.

**The Surprise:**  
It would be a major counter-intuitive finding to prove that **more funding causally leads to _less_ pivoting.**

- **Why it surprises them:** It contradicts the idea that resources enable freedom.
- **The Argument:** Angie’s paper suggests that when you take money, you are often forced to "crystallize" your strategy to justify the investment. The money comes with strings attached—specifically, the expectation of executing the specific plan you pitched. Therefore, a well-funded startup is actually _less_ able to pivot than a lean one, because their "inventory" (their strategy) has been paid for and locked in by the investors. This turns the "Resource-Based View" upside down: resources can be a trap.

My approach is always initially positive — but a positive approach may then underlie subsequent normative advice. 

Here’s the reason I make this suggestion: If you don't understand how the world currently works, it's very hard to prescribe policies to get the world to function in a new way. 

In my own work, I develop models that characterize some situation in the world using assumptions that are at least at an abstract level behaviorally plausible. 

Doing this allows me to understand the dynamics of the world and allows me to say something about what policy interventions may enhance the outcomes on the dimensions I care about. 

Normative advice without a deep understanding and model of how the world actually works is usually just pontificating — the stuff of self-help books. Of course, I recognize that lots of people will disagree with me on what I've just said.

1. how to implement and evaluate three frames 
2. literature for learn vs earn - why was it surprising to you?

gave 20hr lecture in zurich 

communicate it, so worthwile - no choice but to 

bandit model (sutton; random initial two arms; homogenous; when my belief falls below second (endogensously))

modularize ( simon's watch maker)

condition under which his approach is more useful 

one or two arms (one inside vs outside options)- pull the profits and losses (pull the ); one unit 

pre-entry (post-entry)

abstract (key)

key idea and expands on that - hierarchy 

subelements, first paragraph of the introduction (rest of the introduction is)

contribution

search the four paragraph - 

you thought X but I'm Y.
surprise vs novelty

SURPRISE + FACE VALIDITY (buy surprise) + IMPORTANT 

surprise + 

two or three reasons - navigation can provide insight (can't )

audience of vericie of triange (interesting; )
five sentence (lower cost )

explaining heterogeneity

traditional explanation focus on
A. irrationality
B.
C. 

In fact, I show there's simpler explanation; what you've explained in one way can be explained in more fundamental.

e.g. sutton's Sunk Cost and technology (debate on relation between industry concentration and innovation - schumpeter1 (small firms (low concentration; lots of incentives), schumpeter2 (resource to invest) ) -> John Sutton reexamines the traditional agenda. 

nature of industries (technology) is what determined ; all endogenous to one ratio parameter (whole literature on the relationship between concentration and innovation was endogenous to one parameter; underlying one parameter)

#### Insights into Progression:
1. **Conceptual Depth**:
   - The 2018 paper establishes foundational learning dynamics and integrates Bayesian rationality with biases.
   - The 2022 paper expands the scope to team decision-making, considering partnerships' influence on strategic choices.
   - The 2024 paper shifts to dynamic, iterative processes of pivoting as a practical strategy, incorporating feedback loops for both experimentation and exit optimization.

2. **Model Evolution**:
   - The models progress from individual-focused Bayesian learning to group-focused decision-making frameworks and finally to dynamic programming tailored to entrepreneurial pivots.

3. **Shared Theme Exploration**:
   - Across all three papers, the interplay of learning, bias, and decision-making shapes the trajectory of firms from entry through potential exit. Each paper adds layers of complexity and specificity (e.g., individual to team dynamics, static to dynamic strategies).

They may choose to exit if their accrued profits or losses indicate that they should do so (post-entry).                                                 | **Program of Experimentation**<br>• A program of experimentation involves the following choices:<br>  ○ The number of experiments to run, X.<br>  ○ The pivot threshold, θ, which is the belief about Pr(Type = H) below which an entrepreneur will pivot to a new idea:<br>    ■ Conservative threshold is θ = 0.45.<br>    ■ Balanced threshold is θ = 0.50.<br>    ■ Aggressive threshold is θ = 0.55. | **Model Output**<br>• For each population of entrepreneurs, the model produces:<br>  ○ Number of pivots taken.<br>  ○ Proportion of entry and exit errors.<br>  ○ Time spent by each entrant in the market.<br>  ○ Expected profits, net of entry cost.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Ideas**<br>• All ideas, I₁, I₂, ..., Iₙ, are of unknown quality ex ante, either type-H (profitable) or type-L (unprofitable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Experiments vs. Pivots**<br>• Each experiment requires time, κₐ, to set up and evaluate.<br>• Each pivot decision consumes additional time, κₚ, which reflects the costs required to generate tests for a new idea.<br>• The number of actual pivots, N, is a function of X, the pivot threshold, and these pivot costs (N < X).                                                                        | **Key Outcomes about Programs of Experimentation**<br>• Programs of experimentation can generate significant improvements over commitment to a single idea for unbiased entrepreneurs and for entrepreneurs with a broad range of biases.<br>• Programs generating frequent and early pivots may impede learning and underperform more conservative approaches with fewer or later pivots.<br>• Relative to an unbiased entrepreneur, an overestimating entrepreneur optimizes performance by choosing a more aggressive pivot threshold, but not necessarily a higher number of experiments.<br>• When selecting a pivot threshold that fosters more pivots, choosing to evaluate the idea earlier leads to greater value creation. |
| **Entrepreneur**<br>• Entrepreneur starts out with an initial idea, I₁.<br>• Entrepreneur can only learn about one idea at a time.<br>• Entrepreneur commits to a pivot strategy at the onset.<br>• Between experiments, entrepreneur chooses to stick with their current idea, Ij, or to begin experimenting with a new idea, Ij + 1.<br>• Entrepreneur chooses whether to enter with the idea they believe to be best among the pre-entry ideas they investigated. | **Market Entry and Exit**<br>• Entrepreneurs make entry and exit decisions that maximize profits, conditional on their beliefs.<br>• Entrepreneurs enter only if beliefs about Pr(Type = H) correspond to an expected value that exceeds entry cost.<br>• Post-entry, exit only if beliefs about Pr(Type = H) fall below the optimal exit threshold.                                                      | **Other Outcomes**<br>• Negative relationship between the number of pre-entry pivots and post-entry profits and success.<br>• The higher the entry costs (reflecting greater financial risk), the lower (i.e., more conservative) the optimal pivot threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Unbiased Entrepreneur**<br>• Initial beliefs about Pr(Type = H) correct for each idea.<br>• Entrepreneur updates beliefs (learns) correctly given the noisiness of the profit signals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Errors**<br>• Misleading profit signals may lead to the following errors of entry and exit:<br>  ○ Mistaken entry with a type-L idea.<br>  ○ Mistaken nonentry with a type-H idea.<br>  ○ Post-entry, exit delay (i.e., remaining in the market) with a type-L idea.<br>  ○ Post-entry, mistaken exit with a type-H idea.                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
