Here’s the heart of Sonnet 116 in plain, easy words:

1. **True love faces no obstacles.**  
    “Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments.”  
    If two people really love each other, nothing should stand in their way.
    
2. **Real love doesn’t change when things change.**  
    “Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds”  
    If your feelings shift whenever circumstances shift, that isn’t true love.
    
3. **Love is constant and reliable.**  
    “It is an ever-fixed mark… That looks on tempests and is never shaken.”  
    Good love is like a steady lighthouse or a guiding star—no storm, no change of wind can blow it off course.
    
4. **Love withstands the passage of time.**  
    “Love’s not Time’s fool… Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks”  
    Even as people grow old and bodies change, true love stays just as strong.
    
5. **Love lasts until the very end.**  
    “But bears it out even to the edge of doom.”  
    It endures through life’s greatest challenges, right up to death.
    
6. **And if I’m wrong, I’ve never written a word—nor has anyone ever truly loved.**  
    With that final couplet Shakespeare stakes his reputation on this definition: if true love doesn’t behave this way, then he’s never written anything and nobody has ever truly loved.
    
**In one sentence:**  
True love is steady, unchanging, and unwavering—it stands firm through storms, time, and trials until the very end.
