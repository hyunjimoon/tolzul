| **S1 E40**     | Cho-hee is abandoned by the mother who raised her and loses her child during delivery. But the people of Jung-eup have no sympathy for the wife of a traitor Sahwadong. They throw stones at her and beat her.                                                                                                                          |
| **S1 E41**     | Won Kyun is discharged only days after he begins his new job as the High Commander of the Left Cholla Naval Station. Outraged by the king's order, his men refuse to accept Won Kyun's dismissal.                                                                                                                                       |
| **S1 E42**     | Soon-shin goes to work as the new commander of the Left Cholla Navy. Won Kyun barges in during an officers' meeting and confronts Soon-shin for stealing his post.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **S1 E43**     | "The sea is where the enemy will be stopped. I will not let one single enemy set foot on this land."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **S1 E44**     | The only way to contend with the Japanese who are extremely well trained in close combat is to defeat them at sea before they land. To prove this to his disbelieving officers, Soon-shin puts the three Japanese spies that were captured in Bup-sung in a fighting match with Chung Oon's men. Chung Oon's men are quickly defeated.  |
| **S1 E45**     | "Our only hope is our men. Ultimately, war is fought by men not by weapons."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **S1 E46**     | "A unique ship that is one of a kind... A ship only I can make..."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **S1 E47**     | The threat of invasion increases, but even the officers do not seem to fully realize the imminent danger. Soon-shin grows anxious and irritable. When even his most trusted officer Kwon Joon tells him that he cannot serve Soon-shin from the heart, he carefully asks why.                                                           |
| **S1 E48**     | While discussing an onboard battle scenario, Na Dae-yong comes up with an idea of putting a cover on assault vessels. When Soon-shin responds seriously to this ridiculous idea Su-chang argues that the enemy would quickly set fire to the cover and sink the ship.                                                                   |
| **S1 E49**     | After the right officers were put to right duties, things are starting to settle down in the Left Cholla Naval Base, and the military training becomes increasingly vigorous and intense. The most vigorous training of all is the artillery training.                                                                                  |
| **S1 E50**     | A fatal accident occurs during artillery training, but Chung Oon removes the body from the training area and continues the exercise. Disgruntled gunners have had enough of his merciless training. They react by taking the dangerous explosives and attempting a group desertion.                                                     |
| **S1 E51**     | Won Kyun is extremely harsh with his men from the first day of his job, and Lt. Yi Young-nam argues with Won Kyun's unreasonable actions citing the military codes of conduct. Won Kyun challenge Yi to a fighting match.                                                                                                               |
| **S1 E52**     | After becoming the commander of the Right Kyungsang Navy which is larger in size than the Left Cholla Navy, Won Kyun goes to Soon-shin with an entourage of his men as if to undo the humiliation he suffered a year ago when Soon-shin took over his post.                                                                             |
| **S1 E53**     | As the onboard artillery tests yield success and completion of the Turtle Ship draws near, the Left Cholla Navy begins the nautical formation training.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **S1 E54**     | The Turtle Ship sinks to the bottom of the sea before Shin Lip and the other leaders. Won Kyun tells Soon-shin that the idea of fighting at sea is foolish and ridiculous.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **S1 E55**     | Royal messenger brings an order to disband the navy. The base is in confusion once again, but from commanders to petty officers, no one is willing to obey the order.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **S1 E56**     | Soon-shin pleads before the king to rescind the dissolution of the navy. The royal court is stirred up once again, and Prince Kwang-hae begs the king not to forsake valuable retainers like Yi Soon-shin and Yu Sung-ryong.                                                                                                            |
| **S1 E57**     | April 13, 1592, Konishi Yukinaga's troops land in Pusan, and within three days both Pusan Fort and Dong-lae Fort crumbles. Commander of Left Kyungsang Navy sinks his ships and flees the battle.                                                                                                                                       |
| **S1 E58**     | Yi Young-nam continues to request aid despite Soon-shin's rejection. Finally, intelligence reports arrive which indicates that the enemy's strength lies in infantry and that they are not after the control of the ocean. Soon-shin agrees to rendezvous with the Right Kyungsang Navy on the 5th of May in Dang-po.                   |
| **S1 E59**     | First Soon-shin divides the fleet in two and thoroughly inspects the coast. Once he confirms that the surrounding waters are clear, he proceeds to Dang-po and waits for the Right Kyungsang Navy.                                                                                                                                      |
| **S1 E60**     | The special task force successfully accomplishes its mission thanks to the brave sacrifice of San-bok. As refugees continue to escape Dodo's cruel pillage and seek refuge at the base, soldiers become increasingly fearful of the battle ahead.                                                                                       |
| **S1 E61**     | Soon-shin's men are thrilled when they see the Right Kyung-sang Navy. But Won Kyun insists on commanding the battle since they are in his jurisdiction, and speaks his intent to attack the enemy's base.                                                                                                                               |
| **S1 E62**     | Observing that all commands are coming from Soon-shin's ship, Dodo begins concentrated attack on the command ship. Japanese ships come close enough to fire their muskets, but Soon-shin continues to press on.                                                                                                                         |
| **S1 E63**     | The first campaign against the Japanese is a huge success, but Soon-shin punishes Chung Oon by flogging when they return to the base. Uh Young-dam goes to Chung and explains that if they had followed Won Kyun and landed in Okpo, they would've suffered huge casualties.                                                            |
| **S1 E64**     | Once again, Won Kyun is not thinking rationally. Overwhelmed with rage, the soldiers also resolve to go after the enemy. Soon-shin orders them to disband, and he tells Song Hee-rip that a true warrior does not allow his emotions to dictate his actions and to forget the memory of victory.                                        |
| **S1 E65**     | Jotai sends an expert sharpshooter Kansuke to Dodo with instructions to kill Yi Soon-shin. When Gurujima suggests an attack on Soon-shin's naval base, Dodo tells him that Yi Soon-shin is unlike any other warriors in Chosun and suggest thorough reconnaissance of both the Left Cholla and Right Kyung-sang naval stations.         |
| **S1 E66**     | Attacking Gon-yang, Dodo Takadora purposely hurts Won Kyun's ego to provoke him. Won Kyun loses consciousness during a fierce battle and the Right Kyung-sang Navy retreats to the Left Cholla Naval Station.                                                                                                                           |
| **S1 E67**     | Won Kyun orders his men to prepare for battle to recapture Gon-yang. Many of his men think it is a bad idea, but no one can stop him.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **S1 E68**     | Yi Soon-shin is shot. He is losing a lot of blood, and the command ship must return to the base to treat him. But Soon-shin orders his men to continue fighting refusing to leave the battle.                                                                                                                                           |
| **S1 E69**     | The fleet of ships approaching them was not the enemy but the Right Cholla Navy. June 4, 1592, with a fleet of 51 ships in all, the alliance of the Left and Right Cholla Navy and the Right Kyung-sang Navy achieves huge victories in Danghang-po Jin-hae and Yul-po.                                                                 |
| **S1 E70**     | When Japan announces that they will soon be sending another hundred thousand troops to Chosun, Yi Aukki and Yi Soon-shin conclude the Japanese will take the sea route instead of the land route and agree to focus their efforts on defending Cholla Province.                                                                         |
| **S1 E71**     | Chung-hyang who sustained injury during her escape passes out after blurting out that the Turtle Ship is in danger. Yi Young-nam heads for the Left Cholla Naval base with Chung-hyang in his arms, but Wakizaka quickly dispatches his men to destroy the Turtle Ship.                                                                 |
| **S1 E72**     | Wakizaka Yasuharu realizes the time that is required to load and reload the cannons in a battle and devises a new strategy to destroy the Chosunese navy.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **S1 E73**     | Soon-shin orders his men to launch the fleet to Kyunneryang on July 8th. His men resist because the water will be much to enemy's favor that day, but Soon-shin remains firm.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **S1 E74**     | Soon-shin orders his fleet to retreat, and Wakizaka's fleet follow close behind. As they come closer and closer, Wakizaka grows more and more confident of his victory. Then suddenly Soon-shin's fleet stops running and moves into a formation no one has ever seen on the ocean before.                                              |
| **S1 E75**     | Officers show concern when Soon-shin orders the construction of 20 more battleships. New ships require new cannons, and they are running out of gunpowder. Some complain that it is unnecessary work since the Japanese have already been frightened into paralysis.                                                                    |
| **S1 E76**     | Infuriated by his disobedience, Sonjo orders Soon-shin arrested immediately. The court officials also begin to question Soon-shin's loyalty, and Yi Aukki and Won Kyun send messages to Soon-shin refusing to participate in the alliance navy training.                                                                                |
| **S1 E77**     | Yi Young-nam locks up Won Kyun and leads his men to the alliance navy training at the Left Cholla Naval Station. Won Kyun soon follow. Soon-shin places Yi Young-nam under arrest for defying his superior officer's order and leaves it up to Won Kyun to punish him.                                                                  |
| **S1 E78**     | Soon-shin's fleet safely passes through the channel. Gouki, Dodo and the other Japanese warriors are stunned by the Chosunese Navy's land raid. But Wakizaka Yasuharu believes that Soon-shin is going to attempt a landing on Pusan this time, and he shows complete confidence that he can win on land.                               |
| **S1 E79**     | Sonjo receives the victory report, but he is not entirely pleased by the fact that Soon-shin did not press on to recapture Pusan Fort.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **S1 E80**     | If they open the gate, the enemy will take the fort. Kim Shi-min makes a painful decision not to open the gate. Knowing that Kim has no other choice, Commander Yu and his men bravely fight to the death outside the gates of Jinju against 30,000 Japanese soldiers.                                                                  |
| **S1 E81**     | Ming court orders Chosun not to take hostile action against the Japanese forces while the peace talks are in progress. But the Japanese are just using the passive Ming government to keep Chosun temporarily in check.                                                                                                                 |
| **S1 E82**     | Kwang-hae refuses to remove Soon-shin from service, and Yu Jung replies that both Sonjo's throne and Kwang-hae's future throne will not be safe unless Soon-shin is removed.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **S1 E83**     | Learning that Soon-shin had been taken to the capital, Wakizaka Yasuharu plans a full force attack on the Chosunese Navy. But Konishi Yukinaga who is more interested in ending the war quickly and cashing in his benefits tells Ming Commander Shim Yu-kyung that it would be wise to release Yi Soon-shin to resume the peace talks. |
| **S1 E84**     | Soon-shin requests to hold a separate military service examination exclusively for the navy with equal opportunity for all social castes. Yoon Dusu is infuriated by Soon-shin who leads a navy of 20,000 men and now wants control of personnel affairs and questions his loyalty.                                                     |
| **S1 E85**     | As months pass locked in a dead heat with Kyunneryang between the Chosunese Navy and the Japanese invaders, Yi Soon-shin begins to feel the need to break through the stalemate.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **S1 E86**     | The navy is too poor to buy medicine for the sick soldiers, but they can't stop sending offerings to the king. They try to use whatever natural remedies they can find, but nothing proves effective.                                                                                                                                   |
| **S1 E87**     | It's year 1596. As the war enters its fifth year, talks of peace negotiations are heard in the court of Chosun as well, and an envoy is dispatched to Japan. But Soon-shin is against the truce talks as he predicts the terms will be equally unfavorable to Chosun as defeat.                                                         |
| **S1 E88**     | Soon-shin refuses to go to battle that he cannot win, and Sonjo orders him arrested for defying the king's command. Not even Yu Sung-ryong can help Soon-shin now.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **S1 E89**     | Charges of treason and disloyalty. Soon-shin's inquiry begins. When Soon-shin does not confess to wrongdoing despite the treacherous torture, Yoon Dusu realizes Soon-shin will die before he confesses his crime and asks Sonjo to take a special measure.                                                                             |
| **S1 E90**     | Past merits have barely saved Soon-shin from penalty of death. For the second time, Sonjo orders Soon-shin to serve the military as a common soldier. On his way to his post in Soon-chun, Soon-shin learns that his elderly mother is on a boat to Ahsan to see him.                                                                   |
| **S1 E91**     | As the royal court continues to put pressure to attack Pusan, Won Kyun begins to realize why Soon-shin refused to attack Pusan through notes and charts Soon-shin left behind.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **S1 E92**     | Won Kyun's fleet is attacked. After losing 500 of his men in Gaduk, Won Kyun retreats to Chilchundo. Finding out about the situation at the front, Soon-shin prepares for the worst.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **S1 E93**     | Yi Young-nam evacuates the advance camp and burns in down. It's painful to watch the base in flames, but what's more painful is that soon the Japanese will occupy the place. Woo Ji-chuk and his men escape death and make their way to Chogae where Soon-shin is serving his post as a common soldier.                                |
| **S1 E94**     | Yoshira comes to Chosunese navy camp with a proposition to surrender. Soon-shin warns him that the sea of Chosun will be their graveyard if the Japanese attempt to attack his navy again. Yi Soon-shin may be a great naval leader, but 12 battleships is all he has left.                                                             |
| **S1 E95**     | Sonjo receives a self-assured letter from Soon-shin. Taking into account Kwon Yul's report which said the chances of victory is almost none-existent, Sonjo grants Soon-shin's request to fight at sea with intent to hold him responsible for defeat.                                                                                  |
| **S1 E96**     | A fleet of 13 against a fleet of 300. And the current is in enemy's favor. But there is a chance. The oarsmen have trained very hard to hold their position in the swift current, and the Chosunese navy has a secret weapon.                                                                                                           |
| **S1 E97**     | After the victory in Myongryang, Soon-shin and his fleet make a long march along the western coast. It is to declare that the command of the sea belonged to Chosun and to break the morale of the Japanese army.                                                                                                                       |
| **S1 E98**     | Having secured a considerable amount of provisions and men, Soon-shin begins a huge battleship building project and makes Konishi Yukinaga Wekyo his first target.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **S1 E99**     | Feeling threatened by the Chosun-Ming alliance, Konishi Makes a preemptive strike on the Gogeumdo navy base. Jin Lin's Ming navy watches like a spectator, but Chosun navy is fully prepared.                                                                                                                                           |
| **S1 E100**    | Bribed by Konishi Yukinaga, Ming Commander Yu Jung fails to attack as agreed and sends a message to Jin Lin not to go in too deep. Reading his message as a ruse to take credit for the battle alone, Jin Lin puts his fleet in the advance guard position.                                                                             |
| **S1 E101**    | Kwon Yul comes to Soon-shin urging him to let the Japanese retreat without further hostile action. But Japan had deceived Chosun once before calling a truce when there were in trouble then carrying out a second invasion.                                                                                                            |
| **S1 E102**    | When the assassination attempt on Soon-shin fails, Konishi is almost given up on hopes of returning to Japan. With two goals of revenge on Soon-shin and Konishi's rescue, Wakizaka begins to put pressure on Soon-shin by first attacking Kwon Yul's base.                                                                             |
| **S1 E103**    | The Royal emissary demands that Soon-shin open up the retreat path for Konishi and his troops, but Soon-shin will not budge. Officers who had first opposed Soon-shin come around and unite vowing their loyalty once again.                                                                                                            |
| **S1 E104**    | The news that Soon-shin locked up the emissary and went off to fight a battle stuns the royal court. The Westerners move to charge him with high treason, and Yu Sung-ryong turns in his resignation.                                                                                                                                   |

## 명량해전
조선수군은 패배할 것이다. 우리 모두는 전멸할 것이며 그러므로 이곳 명량의 바다는 조선수군의 무덤이 될 것이다. 적이 그렇게 믿고 있다. 또한 대부분의 아군들도 우리 조선수군의 패배를 기정사실로 받아들이고 있다.

나는 지난 육년간 수많은 전장에 부하들을 세워왔고 단 한 번도 진 바 없다. 그는 승리를 확신하지 못하는 전장으로 부하들을 이끈 바 없기 때문이다.

허나 이번에는 나 역시 아무것도 자신할 수 없다. 수십 배에 달하는 적과 싸우기에는 우리가 가진 병력이 너무도 일천하며 울돌목의 저 험준한 역류는 왜적보다 더욱 무서운 적이 되어 우리 앞을 가로 막을 것이다.

그럼에도 이 모든 악조건을 모두 안고서라도 나는 그대들과 더불어 전장으로 나아갈 것을 희망한다. 승리에 대한 확신은 없다. 단 한명이 전상자도 없이 전장을 벗어나리라 장담할 수도 없다. 오직 내가할 수 있는 유일한 약조는 내가 조선수군의 최전선을 지키는 전위군이 되겠다는 것. 그것 뿐이다. 대장선이 가장 먼저 적진으로 진격할 것이며 적을 섬멸하지 않는 한 결코 이 바다를 벗어나지 않을 것이다.

살고자 하면 죽을 것이요, 죽고자 하면 살 것이니 목숨과 바꿔서라도 조국을 지키고 싶은 자, 나를 따르라!!!

제가 아니 나아가 동료들이 인정하는 지휘관은 오직 장군뿐이십니다. 우린 오직 장군의 지휘아래 싸우고 싶을 뿐입니다; 왠지 아십니까? 그 길만이 승리를 보장받을수 있고, 더 나아가 이 지긋지긋한 전란에 종지부를 찍을 수 있기 때문입니다 ; 타협을 하거나 사수를 하지도 않을것이다. 그럴만한 여유가 우리에겐 없어.  혹시 제가 짐작한 바가 맞습니까?

윤두수: 대체 뭔가? 대체 무엇이 그대들을 무모하게 만드는게야?
권준: 시간입니다. 대감. 왜적을 물리치기 위해 방비를 서둘러온 시간. 전란이 터지고 적진으로 진격하여 함께 싸워온 시간. 그 시간이 심어준 믿음과 또한 희망때문입니다.

- 군사들이 전쟁에 나아가 목숨을 걸고 싸울수 있는 연유가 어디에 있다고 보시오? 그는 내가 분전하여 싸울때, 동료와 상관이 나를 지켜주리라는 믿음 때문이오. 그 믿음을 배반하고는 우리는 이 전란을 승리로 이끌수 없소.
- 15척은 곤양으로, 9척은 각각 당포로 (당포의 적은 모두 30여척) 교전 중 그들이 배후를 공격할수 없도록 전력을 다해 막아야할것이다. 무운을 빈다.
- (이순신이 와키자카를 향한 복심술 )진정한 고수는 말이야, 피할수 없는 진검승부라해도 자신이 이길수 없다여기면, 절대로 칼집에서 칼을 빼지 않네. 그자에게 이길수 있는 확신을 심어주지 않으면 승부를 하려하지 않겠지
- 적을 기만하려면 아군까지 기만해야.
- 내가 적을 이길수 있는 조건들은 적에게 있을것이고, 적이 나를 이길 수 있는 조건들은 또한 나에게 있을것이다. 적장의 눈과 심장으로 나의 함대를 본다. 지난 싸움, 함포의 위력과 나의 함대의 명징한 일자진은 적의 심장에 분기를 심어주었다. 적은 그 일자진을 깨기위해 무서운 속도로 돌진할 것이다. 이제는 적이 모르는 내가 필요한다.

귀선은 반만년을 이어온 민족문화를 바탕으로 한 과학기술이 이루어낸 쾌거임과 동시에 우리민족 최대의 창의적 산물이었다. 23전 23승 불패의 신화. 귀선은 가장 큰 버팀목 중 하나.

승리하는 군대는 먼저 승리할 수 있는 태를 치고 적과 싸우며 패하는 군대는 먼저 싸움을 걸어놓고 승리를 추구하는 법이지요

여기에 화살 모양으로 그려 놓은 것은 물길을 표시한 것입니다. 제가 따로 숫자로 표식을 한 것은 매년 월별로 달라지는 수심과 그때 변화되는 기후, 그리고 잡히는 어종과 조난당하기 쉬운 지점을 표시한 것입니다. 또한 검은 점으로 찍어 놓은 섬들은 그나마 사람들이 살기에 적합한 무인도들입니다.

귀선이 우리에게 어떤 존재인지 모른단 말이냐? 우리는 죽을 자격 조차 없는 사람들이다. 모두가 안된다고 해도, 모두가 하지 않겠다고 해도 우리는 멈춰서는 안돼. 그것만이 우리들이 진 빚을 갚는 일이다. 

저희도 장군과 함께 미쳐볼까합니다.

- [[불멸의 혼]] 노래

2025-01-01
새해 아침. 연민의 마음 노래 들으며. "세상을 분기와 혈기로 바꾸려 들지마라" 를 어떻게 받아들여야할까. 적의 창이 가시적인 전쟁의 상황에서 "부하들의 창이 동족의 심장을 겨누게 된다"는 이해가지만, 현 상황에서는 적과 동족의 경계조차 분명치 않으니...

> 이영남:선전관을 풀어준다하셨다구요 옳지못한 결정입니다 장군 허면 적과 싸워 이기고 돌아가도 장군을 기다리는것은 금부도사 의 오라일껍니다.
이순신장군:진실의 힘은 생각보다 크다 이첨사
이영남: 세상은 장군께서 믿고계시는 것처럼 맑고 명지하지가 않습니다
이순신장군:돌을 던지고 싶으냐
이영남: 세상을 바꾸고 싶습니다
이순신 장군:탁류에 돌을 던지면 물은 더 탁해질뿐이다
이영남:장군
이순신장군: 세상을 분기와 혈기로 바꾸려 들지마라. 군인이 그와같이 섣부른 마음을 품으면 부하들의 창이 동족의 심장을 겨누게 된다
이영남:하오나
이순신 장군:명심해라 이첨사 군인의 소임은 오직 조국을 위협하는 적의 창을 온전히 멈추게 하 는데 있다

창을 멈추는 것이 무라는 것. 장수가 잊어서는 적의 창을 온전히 걷어내기 위해서는 말이야, 내가 겨누는 칼의 방향을 올바로 가늠할 필요가 있다.


![[Pasted image 20240526213703.png|200]]


이 사람들도 자네들만큼이나 고단한 사람이네 괴롭히지 말게나.

91화
나라에 충성을 다하려하였으나, 죄인의 몸이 되었으며, 어버이에게 효를 다하고자 하였으나 이미 세상을 버리셨으니 어이하랴 어이하랴 어이하랴
천지간에 이 내몸과 같은 처지가 또 어디에 있단 말인가, 어서 죽는 이만 같지 못하다 (정유년 난중일기)


적의 피로 물든 칼을 동족의 심장에 겨누지 마라. 조선의 이름으로 우리는 모두 하나임을 명심해야할것이다. 내가 전장을 벗어날수 있는 것은 오직 그대들 한사람 조선 수군의 저력을 믿기때문이다. 조선에 대한 충심을 보이라. 그대들이 나를 믿었듯 스스로를 믿고 동료를 믿을 것이며, 지휘관을 믿어야 하느니, 그 믿음이 국난을 극복할 힘을 줄것임을 확신한다. 그대들의 손으로 이 나라 조선을 구하라.

권: 자신의 처지가 가장 나쁜데도 나를 걱정하는듯한 그런 눈은 부담스러워요. 누구나 이장군 같은 순없소. 아무런 계산없이 모든것을 내던지기에 보통의 사람은 두려운 것이 너무 많아요; 우리는 가진것이 너무 많아 세상에 닳고 닳아 ; 사람답게 분기라도 한번 터트려 보라 말입니다. 
이: 지금은 말이 바꿔놓을 수 있는것이 없다. 무슨 말을 할까보단 무슨 일을 할까가 중요한 때입니다.

한달 열흘 형장과 옥방을 전전하면서 말이다 가장 크게 품었던 의문이 있다. 그곳을 벗어나도 세상은 여전히 같은 모양일까. 


104화 
우리가 싸운 것은 비단 왜적뿐만이 아니었다.
우리는 지난 200년간 조선사회에 뿌리 박혀있던 관행, 구습과의 싸움을 시작했다. (경상우수사 이순신)
또한 우리는 무기력하고 나태한 자기 자신과의 싸움에서 이겨냈다. (조방장 김완)
우리는 수많은 불가능에 도전했고, 또 도전했으며 마침내 승리했다. (군관 나대용)
패전의 치욕과 싸워 승전고를 울렸다. (순천부사 우치적)
깊은 절망과 싸워 이겼고, 마침내 희망을 잃지 않는 법을 배웠다. (충청수사 권준)
