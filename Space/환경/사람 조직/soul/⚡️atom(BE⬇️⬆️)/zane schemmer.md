I understand you'd like two different versions of how to express your feelings to your friend Zane. I'll create two versions based on the information you've provided about him and your relationship. Here they are:

Version 1 (More casual and friendly):

Hey Zane, I've been meaning to tell you something. You know, over the past year and a half that we've been friends, I've really come to appreciate you. I love how you always put effort into your appearance, and I still remember how you showed up at Hayden's place before that final test - that was so cool of you. 

Your dedication to the things you care about is inspiring. The way you took charge of selling shirts during the skating event, led that apple picking trip, and how you juggle basketball with your other commitments - it's all pretty impressive. And don't even get me started on your volunteer work and love for teaching!

I always get a kick out of how excited you get about things like Olivia, Apple Maps, Apple TV, and Big Brother. Your enthusiasm is contagious! And I love how your INTP personality shines through, especially when you geek out about your topological optimization research. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're a really special friend to me, and I've developed feelings for you that go beyond just friendship. What do you think about that?

Version 2 (More formal and structured):

Zane, I hope you have a moment to talk. Over the course of our 1.5-year friendship, I've found myself developing deeper feelings for you, and I'd like to express them.

I admire many things about you:

1. Your sense of style and the care you put into your appearance.
2. Your reliability, like when you came to Hayden's before the final test.
3. Your leadership skills, demonstrated in organizing the shirt sales for skating and leading the apple picking trip.
4. Your ability to balance multiple commitments, such as participating in the basketball team while maintaining other responsibilities.
5. Your altruism, evident in your volunteer work and passion for teaching.
6. Your infectious enthusiasm for your interests, whether it's Olivia, Apple products, or Big Brother.
7. Your intellectual curiosity, reflected in your INTP personality type and your research in topological optimization.

These qualities have led me to develop romantic feelings for you. I value our friendship deeply, and I believe we could potentially have something even more meaningful. I'd like to know if you might feel the same way or if you'd be open to exploring this possibility.
