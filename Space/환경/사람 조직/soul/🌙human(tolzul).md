I write to record toltol I experienced, in the form of person, picture, research, movie, etc. Form toltol's matter that affected me is logged 

In Korean, toltol (똘똘) has two meanings. First, toltol$^1$ is a noun meaning a clever, creative, and pure person. Second  toltol$^2$ is an adverb describing close interaction and solid cohesiveness among people. zulzul (절절) is an adjective that denotes eagerness, sincerity, and wholeheartedness.

Picture of Neumann, Feynman, and Ulam.

The conversation between the three toltol$^1$ in the picture makes us wonder what topic they zulzul-ly and toltol$^2$-ly discussed. How much progress of humanity has been made at that moment? What an insightful experience it would have been to be present at their space and time!

Tolzul aims to construct these moments. We scribers who are zulzul to understand our time and space set the goal to delve into the three words: **dynamics, approximation, operator** - each being the legacy of Feynman, Ulam, and Neumann (FUN). Learn with the experience of others; and it is our desire to incite interaction among contemporary toltols$^1$, making them toltol$^2$-ly consolidated. Any toltol who contributes to our zulzul quest, is on our radar!

### Scribed by 
Angie (Hyunji) Moon who is
### zulzul to understand
#Feynman, #dynamics  : every topic related to time, entropy, flow,
#Ulam, #approximation : every topic related to approximation between binary, discrete, continous type  
#Neumann, #operator : operator or function that acts upon the input whose inverse can be imagined (from math, computer etc). Algorithm, program, strategy are included.

## structure
- Theory, Experiment, Computation are three pillars of scientific method. As pointed out in [[def(Digital Twin)]], theory is inductive while the experiment and computation are deductive. 

- Each folder has `_def` folder which captures i) relational traits as within_relation (`diagram`), between_the_other_relation )`table`, and com. For instance, for banana's defintion, we textually express "fruit that grows in batch, having yellow and puply body when riped" in `def`, scientific description banana cell structure would be `within`, figure of banana hanging from the tree or eaten by monkey is `between`. 

- think about dualities for new files (e.g. constructor and destructor, operand and operator, object and function)
