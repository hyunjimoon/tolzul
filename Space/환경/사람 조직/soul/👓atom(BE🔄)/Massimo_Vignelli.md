Massimo designed New York subway map.

I like the quote, as lasting is what I desire. However, how would I know I am doing it "right" at that moment without using the hindsight proof that it lasted? Also, would there be any example of not being right but lasted forever? I think not, as those would have at least, if not all, elements of 'right' elements.
