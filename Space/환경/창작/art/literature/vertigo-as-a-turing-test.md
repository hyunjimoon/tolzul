Nature is the highest abstraction.

Abstraction (a.k.a. quotient or contraction operation) is allowed under consistency.

Movie (animation, simulated dynamic of at least three objects) is a highly abstracted information in that it should follow hidden constraints from all "sensory system" to be "naturally" perceived (visual, auditory, temporal, vestibular etc).

Imagine the time, as a representation of compression ratio, it takes to create the following information types; static -> dynamic -> colored dynamic -> colored dynamic with audio -> 3D colored dynamic with audio ->…-> 4D colored dynamic with audio and olfactory. Increase is not linear but exponential.

Amazingly, however layered the information is, we perceive any hint of inconsistency intuitively; vertigo. As Turing test is invented to judge indistinguishability of human-machine, vertigo would serve similar role for reality-hyper reality.
