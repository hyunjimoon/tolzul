## logic
1. concise overview and number your main points
	1. offering overview primes your audience, preparing for upcoming nfo
2. Utilize the 'problem, solution, benefits' or 'problem, cause, solution' structure.
	- If you want to emphasize the justification for solving the problem and the value of the proposed solution, use the 'problem, solution, benefits' structure.
	- On the other hand, if diagnosing the root cause is crucial and the key is to prescribe a solution based on that analysis, the 'problem, cause, solution' structure would be more suitable.
	Here's an example:	
	- Problem: In order to increase revenue, we need to measure user behavior data more effectively.
	- Solution: Therefore, I recommend that we implement ABC, a trusted data analytics tool that many companies are successfully utilizing for data measurement.
	- Benefits: This analytics tool provides intuitive dashboards and various visualization features, allowing us to easily derive data insights and enhance the speed and accuracy of our decision-making processes.
3. Back up your argument.
	- P (Point of view): State your perspective, which is your bottom line. [Phrases: “From my perspective” , “From my point of view” , “In my opinion.”]
	- R (Reason): Provide a reason for your point. [Phrases: "For the reason that”, “Owing to” , “Due to”, “On account of”, “Stemming from.”]
	- E (Example or Evidence): Give a concrete example or other evidence. [Phrases: "For example”, “For instance”, “To illustrate.”]
	- P (Point of view): Restate your point of view. (optional depending on the situation and length of your message)
