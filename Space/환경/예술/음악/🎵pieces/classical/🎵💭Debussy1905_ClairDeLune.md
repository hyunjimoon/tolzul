**Why it represents Theorizing:**  
This impressionist piano piece creates a dreamlike atmosphere that invites imagination and contemplation. Its flowing quality and harmonic ambiguity open mental space for creative thinking rather than providing definitive statements. Just as moonlight transforms familiar landscapes into mysterious realms of possibility, this piece transforms listeners' perspectives, encouraging them to see beyond the obvious and imagine new potentials.

**Note:** As an instrumental piece, Clair de Lune has no lyrics. It was inspired by Paul Verlaine's poem of the same name.
