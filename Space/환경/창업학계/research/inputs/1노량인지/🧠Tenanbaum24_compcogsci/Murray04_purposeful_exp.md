|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Introduction|How do entrepreneurial firms explore and resolve uncertainty during technological ferment?|• Technology life cycle literature (Abernathy & Utterback, 1978)<br>• Evolutionary perspectives (Hannan & Freeman, 1977)<br>• Organizational learning (Nelson & Winters, 1982)|🧍‍♀️The era of ferment is characterized by high uncertainty requiring entrepreneurial firms to engage in purposeful experimentation rather than opportunistic adaptation|Overview of industry dynamics during technology ferment periods|
|2. Existing Views on Experimentation and Adaptation|What are the current scholarly perspectives on experimentation in new firms?|• Cross-firm experimentation (Hannan & Freeman, 1984)<br>• Within-firm learning (Nelson & Winters, 1982)<br>• Opportunistic adaptation (Bhide, 2000)|🧭Two contrasting views exist: (1) experimentation occurs across firms with little room for entrepreneurial agency vs. (2) learning occurs within firms primarily through routine-based adaptation|Table 1: Modes of learning framework comparing across-firm vs. within-firm approaches|
|3. Definition and Taxonomy of Entrepreneurial Experimentation|What constitutes purposeful experimentation in entrepreneurial settings?|• Scientific experimentation literature (Campbell, 1979)<br>• Experimental design research<br>• Product development methodologies|🗺️Purposeful experimentation is the application of "scientific method" to key business parameters, involving hypothesis formulation, testing, and analysis to resolve uncertainty|Description of scientific vs. business experimentation approaches and commonalities|
|4. Degree of Simultaneity (Sequential vs. Parallel)|How do sequential and parallel approaches to experimentation differ?|• Product development literature (Thomke, 1998)<br>• Research on simulation technologies<br>• Work on experimental timing|🌏Entrepreneurial firms face trade-offs between sequential approaches (learning between experiments) and parallel approaches (pursuing multiple paths simultaneously)|Case evidence showing how Surface Logix initially maintained parallel experiments across three domains|
|5. Degree of Parameter Manipulation (Modular vs. Combinatorial)|How do firms choose which parameters to vary in experiments?|• Literature on factorial design<br>• Research on experiment manipulation<br>• Technical vs. market domain experimentation|👓The nature of experiments varies from modular (varying one parameter) to combinatorial (simultaneously testing multiple dimensions), with different costs and benefits|Examples from Surface Logix showing shifts between technical, market and business model experimentation|
|6. Evidence of Purposeful Experimentation: Surface Logix Case Study|How does purposeful experimentation manifest in practice?|• Field-based research methodologies<br>• Case study approaches (Eisenhardt, 1989)<br>• Technology entrepreneurship literature|🧠Surface Logix demonstrates how entrepreneurial firms conduct conscious hypothesis-driven experiments across technology, market and business model domains rather than relying on random search|Detailed case evidence with three major experiment types documented in Table 2, showing problem identification, hypothesis generation, and testing across domains|
|7. What is Not Purposeful Experimentation|How does purposeful experimentation differ from other learning forms?|• Research on opportunistic adaptation<br>• Literature on user-based innovation<br>• Studies of undirected learning|🤜Even entrepreneurial firms engage in opportunistic learning alongside purposeful experimentation, especially in early stages when responding to external opportunities|Examples from Surface Logix showing undirected learning from customers and scientists driven by curiosity rather than planned exploration|
|8. Discussion and Conclusions|What are the broader implications for understanding entrepreneurial processes?|• Literature on organizational inertia<br>• Research on legitimacy (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994)<br>• Work on entrepreneurial strategy|🌏Purposeful experimentation is a distinctive form of entrepreneurial learning that balances building options with practical constraints, helping firms navigate uncertainty while maintaining legitimacy|Synthesis of findings showing how experimentation can create rather than limit options, challenging assumptions about entrepreneurial adaptation|

This table captures the paper's structural organization and conceptual flow, showing how Murray and Tripsas developed their framework for understanding purposeful experimentation in entrepreneurial settings. The research demonstrates that entrepreneurial firms actively engage in hypothesis-driven experimentation rather than purely opportunistic adaptation, while navigating important trade-offs between parallel/sequential approaches and modular/combinatorial parameter testing.
