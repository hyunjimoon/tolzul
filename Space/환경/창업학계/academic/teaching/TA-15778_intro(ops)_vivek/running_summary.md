## 📝 Session Notes

### Session 1: Fast Food Operations (McDonald's vs. Burger King)
**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Case**: McDonald's Corp. & Burger King Corp.

#### 🎯 Product Definition
- **Problem Solved**: Quick, affordable meals for time-constrained customers
- **Value Proposition**: 
  - McDonald's: Speed + consistency + low price
  - Burger King: Customization ("Have it your way") + quality
- **Customer Alternative**: Other fast food chains, sit-down restaurants, home cooking

#### 💪 Capabilities Analysis
- **Key Resources**: 
  - McDonald's: Standardized equipment, line flow process, pre-made inventory
  - Burger King: Flexible assembly stations, steam tables, customization capability
- **Constraints**: 
  - McDonald's: No customization possible without disrupting flow
  - Burger King: Slower service time (4 min vs 2 min)
- **Competitive Advantage**: 
  - McDonald's: Speed and efficiency at scale
  - Burger King: Product flexibility

#### 🔄 Product-Capability Dynamic
- **Current State**: Trade-off between speed and flexibility
- **1-Year Vision**: Optimize within chosen model
- **4-Year Vision**: Technology might enable mass customization
- **Resource Investment Needed**: Process redesign vs. technology adoption

#### 📊 Value Dimensions Performance
- **Time**: 
  - McDonald's: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1.5-2 minutes)
  - Burger King: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (4 minutes)
- **Quality**: Both ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (standardized fast food quality)
- **Flexibility**: 
  - McDonald's: ⭐☆☆☆☆ (no customization)
  - Burger King: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (limited customization)
- **Price**: Both ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (competitive pricing)

#### 🔑 Key Insights
1. **Time matters more than expected**: 7 seconds improvement = 3% market share gain
2. **Process design drives product capability**: MTS enables speed but kills flexibility
3. **The utilization puzzle**: Both chains show low utilization (40-79%) yet BK has slow service

#### ❓ Open Questions
1. Why does low utilization coexist with slow service at Burger King?
2. How might technology change the speed-flexibility trade-off?
3. What hidden constraints exist beyond simple capacity?

#### 🔗 Key Concepts Introduced
- **Make-to-Stock (MTS)**: McDonald's approach - premade products
- **Hybrid Make-to-Order**: Burger King's partial customization
- **Process Capacity**: Bottleneck analysis (assembly station)
- **Utilization**: Demand/Capacity ratio
