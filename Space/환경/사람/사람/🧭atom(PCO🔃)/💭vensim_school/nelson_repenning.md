application of this theory
- More companies are cutting their IT and software engineering departments these days while bringing in AI code generation tools to, presumably, maintain/grow productivity. This is, of course, bullshit.  
  
Complex learning curves are fairly well understood (Wright's Law is nearly 90 years old, and has been a more accurate predictor than even Moore's Law) and yet consistently ignored by decision makers to serve a short term agenda. As I've posted many times before, research shows that it takes on average 5-7 years for an organization to absorb a new technology, let alone be proficient at it.  
  
But I continue to see Wall Street reports of companies cutting X% of their engineering, but it's ok because they will recoup that X% via Github Copilot (AI code generator). Don't believe it. What you will see over the next year is this:  
  
1. Reduction in output and quality  
2. Burnout and culture collapse (as the remaining team attempts to learn new tools and maintain output)  
3. Annoyed business stakeholders (who either see their features cut or late/buggy products)  
4. Executive desperation (which will turn to outsourcing, over-hiring, and a few heads rolling)  
  
I'm not saying that there isn't much room for improvement. I'm a firm believer that most IT departments are expensive, complex, opaque, and poorly run. However, there's a right way to fix this, and a wrong way (the Capability Trap is a real thing). My thirty years experience is telling you: AI code generation tools are NOT the fix. It's a great capability and you should invest in its adoption, but it will take years to show value.
