I am Angie Moon, dedicated to advancing Bayesian Entrepreneurship to enhance startup success rates. My academic and professional journey, rooted in industrial engineering and Bayesian statistics, fuels my commitment to developing a platform that leverages probabilistic computing for strategic startup guidance. This initiative aims to provide startups with data-informed insights that adapt to market and technological changes, improving their chances of success.

My engagement with the Bayesian community is demonstrated through several impactful activities. As the chair of StanCon, I've facilitated forums that foster innovation and collaboration among practitioners and researchers. I also spearheaded the translation of the "Bayesian Data Analysis" textbook into Korean, expanding access to Bayesian methods in educational and professional settings across Korea. Furthermore, through my founding of StanKorea, which boasts over 1,100 subscribers, I've nurtured a growing network of enthusiasts and professionals dedicated to Bayesian approaches. My role in these initiatives underscores my commitment to practical applications of Bayesian methods and makes me a strong candidate for the StanCon scholarship. Attending StanCon will allow me to share these experiences, learn from peers, and further integrate Bayesian insights into entrepreneurial strategies.

| **Value Proposition** | Provides startups with a 24/7 intelligent and well-trained encyclopedic advisor, superior to periodic meetings with mentors/VCs | Provides startup educators an intelligent assistant that helps designing temporally valid curriculum to equip startups with strategies and operational skills that adapts to new data on technology and market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Belief**            | Validity of the tool's output can best be tested directly by startups, which should be the primary focus initially              | - educators have a higher faith in the existence of "settled startup science" than startup<br><br>- educators have a capability and bandwidth to contribute to enhancing quality of knowledge production via programmatic theories (Cronin et.al., 2021 Why Theory on “How Theory Fits Together” Benefits Management Scholarship)<br><br>- I follow "build what you need, use what you've built" as users are the most eligible desirability evaluators. Probability of myself being a startup educator is higher than startup founder |
