I started NextOpt (next number and optimization) in 2017 and our mission is: providing advanced, yet affordable, analytics for all. One of the major challenges for retailers is being able to access and interpret analytics for management. Sadly, many of them cannot afford analytics services for decision making and that makes them even more hesitant about the value-add of using new tools. I would like to fill this gap by providing analytics tools based on my research at an affordable cost. This has been my consistent goal from the [start](https://www.facebook.com/hyunjimoon95/posts/2187661947914274) and will be for the foreseeable future.

Based on our experience in the logistics and defense industry, we will expand the domain; wherever prediction and optimization are needed is our target, especially where the gap is apparent.

Ongoing projects:

\[1\] Reliability prediction to optimize repair part inventory (battleship, airplane, tank)  
Client: Republic of Korea Armed Forces  
[Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJyNntNMH4&t=4s&ab_channel=Stan) on this topic at StanCon, 2020.

\[2\] Operating analytics [web service](https://qtell.co.kr/); forecasts demand, optimizes inventory Client: small business / Budget: TBD

\[3\] Forklift repair policy optimization based on engine reliability  
Client - LogisAll (Pallet Rental Company; $500m Yearly Rev.)
