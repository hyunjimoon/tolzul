1. design and technology for people-centric cities
```
Learn to leverage technology to make the city of the future work like a small village of the past.
- Recall the history of urban communities and how human settlements have evolved over time
- Recognize the economic impact of transforming the way cities are designed
- Identify the challenges and opportunities society faces as a result of current city design
- Discuss how global challenges can be addressed by harnessing the current trend away from ownership and toward sharing
- Review a data-driven, evidence-based process for designing people-centric future cities
- Demonstrate why it is a societal imperative to address global challenges at a local level
```
2. the mobility revolution and urban robotics
```
Use data to understand the most efficient and sustainable ways for people to move around a city.
- Identify current mobility modes and patterns and the challenges they present
- Discuss the role of big data, and the privacy implications thereof, in modeling and improving current mobility patterns in cities
- Determine how emerging mobility modes and their attributes might provide solutions to challenges such as congestion and COâ‚‚ emissions
- Compare new mobility modes that fall into three categories: personal systems, mass transit, and delivery
- Assess various mobility modes based on agent-based modeling data to improve mobility patterns and livability in an urban community
- Propose a solution to current mobility challenges by analyzing data about current mobility patterns, considering emerging mobility modes and their attributes
```
3. live-work transformation: robotics, prefabrication, iot tech
```
Explore technological innovation such as architectural robotics, AI, and new materials for urban living that will transform the way people live and work.
- Discuss the current challenges caused by a short supply of housing in urban centers
- Identify multifunctional, transformable, compact homes and innovative technologies within living spaces as solutions to the current urban housing crisis
- Articulate the privacy implications associated with the use of innovative technology in living spaces
- Show how reimagined work spaces and community-centered innovation districts can make cities more equitable, vibrant, and liveable
```
4. network of neighborhoods: ai, real-time simulation, emerging systems
```
Discover how density, proximity, and diversity, together with a focus on connected communities, can create high-performance cities.
- Identify the importance of collecting data at a local level using the radar plot and its metrics
- Articulate how effective use of public spaces can bolster a community and improve quality of life
- Determine the impact of various interventions on density, proximity, and diversity in cities
- Justify your choices for prioritizing certain parameters for urban living-space design, using an evidence-based model
- Propose how you would receive buy-in from community members around the intervention you have decided to implement
```
5. sustainable communities: local production and lower consumption
```
Explore interventions and distributed systems that encourage communities to consume less resources and produce locally.
- Discuss time as a valuable resource in modern society
- Identify industries in which urban communities are consuming too much energy
- Determine how improvements in urban mobility, housing, workspaces, and production methods can result in energy conservation
- Deduce how the intersection of behavioral changes and technological interventions can decrease energy use in cities
- Assess the relationship between mobility modes, access to housing, and energy consumption using data
```
6. governance: token economies and algorithmic zoning for prosocial behaviors
```
Explore future speculations on how new governance models, behaviors, and emerging technologies will facilitate healthier urban communities.
- Recognize how encryption and identity authentication can increase the autonomy of people living in urban communities
- Discuss privacy issues around autonomous technology and data use
- Articulate how blockchain technology and local token economies can incentivize and reward desirable behavior in urban communities
- Conclude whether or not algorithmic zoning can incentivize prosocial behaviors from landowners
- Evaluate effective land use and distributed systems as ways to reduce energy consumption
- Draft an outline of new governance models, behaviors, and emerging technologies that could provide sanitation, water, and electricity to an informal settlement
