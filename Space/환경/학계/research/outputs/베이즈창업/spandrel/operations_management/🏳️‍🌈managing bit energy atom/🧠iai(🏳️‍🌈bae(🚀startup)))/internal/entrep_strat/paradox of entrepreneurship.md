The [Trust Paradox](https://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/7090/thesis.pdf?sequence=4)," defines it as a situation where "assumptions of the other's future actions steer today's actions." when choosing between inverted (social/decision science) vs reverted (physics) time - [gemini link](https://poe.com/s/50pV8OmeGd9Ptg1E0PMb) includes links to physics theory and trust paradox

define pivot and startup with established theory
1. finite horizon, with some assumption (11yr startup can't exist)
2. convergence
– Ranking alternative viable strategic commitments requires knowledge that can only be gained through experimentation, but experimentation ultimately results in some level of commitment that forecloses particular strategic options.

- **시간을 한쪽으로 제쳐놓고 그것 이 간 거리를 곧 시간이라 생각하여 같은 시간 중에 하나가 다른 것의 두 배**라고 한 것이다
- paradox = space, time, motion the wrong way
-  (잘못된 푸는 법) 제논은 물체의 운동을 설명하면서 물체가 이동한 거리만을 고려하여 물체가 이동하는 데 걸린 시간은 고려하지 않았다. 실제 물체의 이동은 움직이는 데 걸린 시간으로 움직인 거리를 나누어서 속도를 구하여 비교해야 한다. 즉 물체의 이동은 속도에 의해 표현된다.
- 속력 = 공간/시간 (산업마다 시간이 다르게 간다 - 이를 이용한 arbitrage?)

- Zeno devised this paradox to support the argument that change and motion weren’t real. Nick Huggett, a philosopher of physics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says that Zeno’s point was “Sure it’s crazy to deny motion, but to accept it is worse.” The paradox reveals a mismatch between the way we think about the world and the way the world actually is. (This seems obvious, but it’s hard to grapple with the paradox if you don’t articulate this point.) Joseph Mazur, a professor emeritus of mathematics at Marlboro College and author of the forthcoming book [_Enlightening Symbols_](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691154635/?tag=slatmaga-20), describes the paradox as “a trick in making you think about space, time, and motion the wrong way.”
