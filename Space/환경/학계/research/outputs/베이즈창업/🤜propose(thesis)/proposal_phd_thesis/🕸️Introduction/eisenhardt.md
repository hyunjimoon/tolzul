**Disagree - Eisenhardt (1989)**: "Making Fast Strategic Decisions in High-Velocity Environments" Abstract: "This study explores how executive teams make rapid decisions in high-velocity environments. Based on data from eight microcomputer firms, the research reveals that fast decision makers use more, not less, information and develop more, not fewer, alternatives. They also rely on experienced counselors, resolve conflicts through 'consensus with qualification,' and integrate strategic decisions with tactical planning." _Relevance: Argues against formal optimization rules, suggesting successful entrepreneurs rely on heuristics and rapid qualitative decision-making rather than analytical frameworks._
