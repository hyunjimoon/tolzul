Speaker 1  0:00  
Handling stuff, so on and so forth. And what we started thinking about yesterday was it's a really nice concept, like, how do you go about accomplishing it in practice, right? And we saw, you know, yet was like a nice example into sort of saying, listen, Okay, what about, what about thinking about these sort of issues of scale, and, you know, turn our attention to companies like Amazon, right? Truly, truly a company. And really where we were was this question, which is that I asked you to take some time, you think about, sort of what makes Amazon attractive to you, right? And there are a whole bunch of different things that came out off this discussion. But perhaps one way of summarizing the discussion, sort of picking up where I left off yesterday, was that really, as you sort of think about Amazon and you kind of contrast Amazon with really every step in your process to purchase something, right? Amazon is focused on removing friction at that step, right? So we said, look, as you think about your process of making a purchase, it starts with a search, right? You have some need, and you're searching for things that might fit that need. And again, Amazon is all about minimizing frictions with respect to that search, right? In a variety of different ways. We have a lot of options. We have a very powerful search engine so on. So you see a bunch of options, and not only by the way, you see options that are generic. You see options that are tailored to you, right? Because they have all of this data about you and so on and so forth. You see a set of options. That set of options is, like, you know, it would be different, like, I searched for something text studies, right? So we see these two different lists, and then, you know, once you have that list, there's this whole sort of, you know, analysis paralysis thing, that kind of present solution of paradox of choice. And they really appreciate that. They want to help you kind of cut through, you know, the noise as quickly as possible. So they have reviews, right? And so then you kind of converge, hopefully become a decision relatively quickly. You know, any concerns that you might have that, oh, you know what? Any revenue concerns that, oh, you know, this doesn't quite fit my needs. You know, we talked about like returns, right? Returns are easy, so you're on the back end. So what if I made a mistake and then you want to go make that purchase? What does it take? It just takes like, giving, like, a buy now, left, right. That's it. I think that when it comes to that Buy Now button, right, there's a lot of effort behind the scenes in kind of making that truly kind of one click. And you might wonder, well, why this is that? And it all has to do with the way credit card transactions work and how risk gets handled in that whole supply chain, right? Amazon, as I mentioned yesterday, you know, Amazon's determined that really, every 10 minutes happens in delay when you're checking out, effectively results in sort of an increased risk that you won't make the purchase. And so they've kind of figured that they'd rather, kind of like, get rid of that delay and figure other ways of, sort of managing risk. And they're very, very careful and very clever about how they do the last thing we said was basically, you know, if we, if we, if we sort of think about this, this entire sort of business from like, you know, you kind of having the idea and finding what works for you to transacting each of the things that Amazon does over there is almost like a business unto itself, Right? Like, one click. Checkout is a giant industry, right? A whole bunch of people are trying to do one quick check out for people that are not absent, right? And so on. Okay, so, so that's kind of what we what we discussed yesterday, right? So here's kind of what I and hopefully we have a clear sense as a consumer, you know, we've kind of sharpened our kind of thinking of like, Hey, why is it that I really like this thing, right? So the plan for today is to follow through what I'd like to do in like the first 20 or 30 minutes, is perhaps do a deep dive into some of Amazon supply chain capabilities. I just want to kind of, because there's so many things to focus on, right? We can't focus on all those things. Let's just think about, let's just start thinking about the supply chain, because that's, that's sort of core to, kind of the value they they provide, right? And so let's, let's sort of talk about that to begin with, right? And then from there, what I'd like to do is kind of like turn our attention around and sort of start thinking about how we might actually be answering because that's the plan. That's the that's the discussion. Ah, there a time

Speaker 2  4:45  
you recall time where you realized that Amazon actually had a breakthrough? This is just one of no return. Amazon is a rich company. I might want to invest in that or too

Speaker 3  5:00  
little. I think when that, when that happened, right?

Speaker 1  5:07  
No, no. But my point is, like, I think that happened when I was in ninth grade. So like, I'll tell you what? So I'll tell you a little story, the great question, so I'll tell you a story. So I might even have this on a slide somewhere for a future class, but I'll just tell it to you right now, right? So, so basically, what was Amazon stock? So Amazon stock was selling books, right? And then this, there's this article from like, way back. It's 1996 by 97 okay? Yeah.

Speaker 1  5:47  
And the article is basically, the Bezos is at this book fair. It's like, massive book fair, right? And there's this guy that actually, who wrote the article, you know, that shows up and says, like, Hey, listen, like, you know, it was called, I don't know if you remember this, but Amazon Bernie tagline was, like, first biggest bookstore. You guys remember this, right? So it's like, a 60 pack name, right? So it's first biggest bookstore since guys stop by to your first biggest bookstore. Like, like, what does that mean? Because, like, I have an online bookstore too, you know, and they ask them all these questions, like, you know, but what's your catalog? Whatever this, it didn't feel like there was anything like, particularly different. And so these good questions. Bezos was like, kind of WTF, like, what? Right? And business, he was like, just, he was like, Oh, they get lost on these books, right? There's like, No. And so his point was that he wanted to use this as a way to collect data, right? He said, Look, I just want to understand how people behave online, how they transact on right? And I want to get all this data about them. And once I have this data, I don't really care about selling books. I care about selling everything, right? So I think it started at the beginning. I don't think there was like one kind of fell swoop. I also feel, by the way, just more generically, like these big, sort of successful thriving businesses, right? They all, it's not like, like, there's suddenly, like a bright spark, and, like, you know, something, something happens. I think typically it starts with, like, very high conviction from like, big money, right? And, you know, the founders are full obsessed on every little detail, like, in my mind, right? Let me look at this from the outside. You might look at those little details and find this pretty strange and say, like, why are you focusing on those details? It feels silly, right? Like you're beneficial product. But I think in reality, it sort of boils down to a lot of these folks as, like, very long term plans for what they want to do as a result. Like, no detail is too small, because it kind of started in this very long term fund. So I think it's easier to talk about this after the fact, right? But I think, like repeatedly, time and time again, right? Amazon has shown things within this kind of culture of sort of evolution, and speak to sort of this, like a very long term kind of philosophy. So they're truly terrifying companies, right? Because they kind of like, kind of walk the walk, so to speak. So I don't think, though, just like one moment, I think he had this conception, like 30 years ago. I guess at this point that this would be possible, the conception ended up being true. But I think what made it true for him, more than more than others, was their ability to kind of execute on the idea, right? Oh, my God. And by the way, I think to a large extent, conviction like Wall Street give them a lot of like rope, right? And I think they've had lots of like, lucky things, right? I've lost you could have been patient with them, and so on and so forth. But so there's a lot of things that I think have come together to eventually make them successful, right? But I don't think it was like, oh my god, they have super lucky. I may be wrong. That's my depressive so so let's, let's turn to to Amazon supply chain. And here's kind of what I'd like to start with. Okay, so as we sort of think about their supply chain, what kind of the big decision variables with their supply chain, right, as they design a supply chain, as they run a supply chain. But what are the, what are the big decision? Variables? Go ahead, sure. Okay. So, okay. So warehouses. So, with respect to warehouses, one thing is location good. I like that. What else? So suppliers? Suppliers. So who are their suppliers going to be? I like that, right?

Unknown Speaker  10:13  
Okay, good. So location, how big

Unknown Speaker  10:18  
today eventually spread, how much and

Speaker 1  10:21  
where. Good. So with inventory, there's sort of how much to carry and where, right? Other

Unknown Speaker  10:43  
questions. Go ahead, demand uncertainty.

Speaker 1  10:48  
But how's that a decision variable like this? That's something they think,

Speaker 4  10:52  
if they could control the uncertainty or reduce it somehow, by forecasting demand.

Speaker 1  10:59  
For example, some products Got it, got it so tactically in running the supply chain, they need to invest, perhaps, in, like, you know, sophisticated forecast, right? Okay, I agree. So, you know, running the supply chain, you know, demand forecasting is probably pretty important. I agreed for this, each country have kind of different suppliers, dynamics, sure. So all this needs to be localized.

Speaker 5  11:37  
Standard, standard reader time. What do you mean by that? A little time, you know, like approach promise to the customer.

Speaker 1  11:45  
Oh, okay, okay, got it. Got it. So I like that. So I'm gonna call that promise time, right? Because that's kind of the term people use when you talk about doing it to a customer. So what is the promise time? And you know that could vary, right? Certain products that have very low promise types, others that have like higher promise types. Yes, it makes very good sense, and it's important thing to decide, okay, infrastructure and the top locations. Infrastructure in what in the top locations of important infrastructure in important locations? Sorry, I misunderstand

Unknown Speaker  12:19  
infrastructure in the pod locations, because they're

Speaker 1  12:23  
important. Locations, import locations. Got it, got it, got it. I see. So when you say import locations, what do you mean? Do you mean who they're importing from, or where they're like, the ports they import, they don't have a huge amount of choice there, right? At least when I touched North America. Because if you start to think about, like, ports in North America for this sort of stuff, like ones on sort of, like, on the eastern seaboard, there's like one or two, and on the West Coast, they're basically like Long Beach, where most of it goes, and then there's, like the Port of LA, which is, like, much smaller, and so on and so forth. They don't have that much choice, but, but you're you're right, that, in a generic sense, that might have been a thing, yeah, like, yeah, number of vehicles, okay, so there's, like, the whole logistics network, right? So in terms of the logistics network, actually, here, there's a lot of decisions, you know, number of vehicles, sure. Pres. You can think about where they are this and that

Unknown Speaker  13:25  
lots of other things.

Speaker 1  13:34  
Got it. So I wouldn't I think that's an interesting decision. And actually, I believe they have their own gateways now, but because they handle so much volume. But I'm going to view that as, I guess, sort of supply chain decision, right? It's more of, like a, it's kind of an important decision, but I think it's more in kind of the front end of like, you know, the interaction with the customer. I Yeah, so there's a whole like World of kind of dispatching and routing and so on and so forth. You know, that's really, that's really important.

Speaker 1  14:20  
Yeah, there's no end of those sorts of to those sorts of sorts of problems. What do you mean by constrain the labor

Unknown Speaker  14:32  
and the number of workers or technology?

Speaker 1  14:38  
Good, good. So I understand what you're saying. So basically, you know, I think the biggest place that matters is probably the warehouses, right? And so there's, like, a lot of like, staffing decisions to actually worry about over here that are actually really, really important. Yeah, that's a really important one. Brandon, did I talk to you

Speaker 2  15:02  
now? Kind of the flip side of all this is, what do you not want to stock? So where do we want?

Speaker 1  15:09  
So that's under inventory. You know? What not to stop. I like that. Any things that are substantively different for this go, yes, because they don't have a large

Speaker 1  15:32  
amount of data. Sure, sure. So I think in general, they want to make, like, big investments in sort of, like, let's call it, you know, like intelligence, right? You want to make big investments in intelligence over here, because there's so many different things that they need this intelligence for. There's forecasting, which we already called out, but then there's operational decisions related to kind of, how much to order, where to order, when to order it, how's it going to be dispatched? Who's there, right? Like, so they need this whole brain that runs this, and that's, that's kind of like a substantive sort of investment. So I think more generally, over here, I'm going to call this a brain, right, to run all this, and they make very big investment. Now, in each we could go on, right? There's so many different things. And kind of, each of these categories is like, kind of get by itself can be a big deal. So for instance, like, Alex's point about, like, staffing, right? There's so many things going on in Amazon, Visa V staff, right? So what on the one hand, you know, they you know. And we could spend almost an entire lecture on this right, which I'm not going to spend, but I just want to kind of point out that each of these things is a big deal. Like with staffing, on the one hand, they're working really, really hard to kind of build a workforce that they can rely right? So by major their work, a big chunk of that workforce ends up being seasonal, sort of very problematic. And so they're thinking very carefully about, you know, how they sort of develop a more kind of sustainable, kind of hiring sort of process, more sustainable workforce, so on and so forth. Very much on the flip side, what they're saying is, like, listen, and this goes back to, like, kind of Yakima, sort of earlier point, right? I think their vision is like, you know, in 10 years, we don't have a workforce, right? Like, in 10 years, you're gonna have robots that do every single thing a human being does in the warehouse, and they make extraordinary investments, right? Actually, a really close friend of mine was a founder and company called covariance, right? Hundreds of millions of dollars for covariance is one of the investment best known roboticists in the world, and they need a giant sum of money to, kind of like, like, an ungodly sum of money to bring in that entire team, right? Why? And what is that team focused on? Let's focus on this, like, long run vision, right? That, like, basically not going to be human too. Like, how many of you watch the videos of the warehouse. Okay, so some detail, okay, a bunch of you did, right? So you've seen that, like, you know, there's a lot of human beings involved, right, that pick things and pack them. There's a lot of human labor that goes into it. And the long term views kind of not happens, right? And so this is kind of an example of, like, kind of thinking really long, right? You're having this very long horizon kind of view of things. So each of these things, I think you know, is a very exciting discussion unto itself. What I'd like to focus on, just to kind of keep things clean, right? Because, again, there's so much to talk about over here. There's perhaps just one kind of decision, okay, which is actually the first thing someone brought up, right? So we have all these warehouses, right? And so my, my, my question with the warehouses is, you know, really, how many warehouses should we have, and how are we going to think about how many warehouses to have, right, and where to place them? How do you how do you how do you want to think about that? Okay, so, so broadly speaking, I want to talk about that in a fancy way. Really, I'm talking about, like the topology of their distribution network. Okay, so how many of these things do they have? Where are they right? Let's zoom into that for for a quick second. Okay, so how do we want to consider that? Michelle gets spoken

Unknown Speaker  19:20  
up models so

Unknown Speaker  19:22  
they have have ops centers,

Unknown Speaker  19:23  
and then they have smaller, kind

Speaker 1  19:33  
of modular houses, okay? Why? Because

Unknown Speaker  19:36  
that's where the customers

Speaker 1  19:42  
are, right? Okay, so if I sort of think about it, the distribution network is kind of the last epic. So your view of that last epoch is to be as close to the city as possible, right? Yeah. So basically, your point of view is, I want to be as close to the city as possible. You know? And the value of that is clear. I'm close to the customer. Again. What's the opposite of this? Right? So the benefit of having like these, like little DCS, right? So what you're saying is, I start thinking about this, right? If I broadly right? And remember that distribution app is, like the last epic, okay, so, so, when I, when I, when I sort of think about this one extreme, okay, so I have a lot of these warehouses very close to the customer, right? That's, that's basically, that's basically what you're saying. So, so I have a bunch of these things. Okay, what's the, what's the opposite of this? I have like, one gigantic DC, right, like, somewhere in, like Nashville, that's the central of the US population, okay, so, so somewhere near Nashville, I place this, like ginormous DC, right? That's, like, I don't know, 200 acres, or something like that, 1000 acres, whatever, right? Some gigantic so I can do that right. One giant piece. What are the trade offs between these two things? Right? It's tempting, obviously, think about the right one immediately. I'm sort of curious about what the what the trade offs are. Cameron on the left one.

Speaker 2  21:19  
You have to worry less about individual inventory levels, the spread, it's all there, and now you're

Speaker 1  21:26  
Yeah, so on the left hand side, the benefit is, right? This is nicely pulled, right. Risk is put, okay, so that's, that's actually really nice, right? What else? What are some other benefits show

Speaker 5  21:44  
top left side is the So, capex, less standard. So, like,

Speaker 1  21:47  
yeah, so you get, like, really good kind of economies of scale and scope, all these things, right, right? You have, like, one kind of centralized sort of thing. It's almost like, why, like, big companies have, like, like, a factory town or something like that, right? You have massive economies of scale and scope. So I could get back Sandra,

Speaker 6  22:09  
I guess the cost would be even, I mean, below, because you only have to do one one time, and then, instead of, like,

Speaker 1  22:16  
that's exactly right. So it's just low cost. Alexander, yeah. And so that's kind of this thing over here, like everybody remembers, right? What is inventory cost? K, sigma, yeah, right. That's, that's inventory cost, and that sigma is actually lower, right? Why is it lower? Because I'm averaging out demand for the whole country, right? And so we know by kind of the pooling that we talked about that inventory cost is actually really low. So low inventory cost. Okay, good. Those are the advantages. What are the corresponding maybe disadvantages of you, can join Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  23:03  
One of the disadvantages is that the centralized model

Unknown Speaker  23:05  
is slow. In what sense, by

Speaker 7  23:09  
then, the delivery of the product compared to decentralized?

Speaker 1  23:15  
Yeah, so let's actually think through that for a second, right? If we sort of think about like promise times over here. This is what should I talked about earlier, right? If we think about promise times over, I'm sitting in the middle of the country, right? Something has to give. So one is, you know, either slow delivery, if I insist on delivery being super fast, it's gonna be really expensive, right? Like, I'm gonna have all these, like, logistics, like, I'm gonna have tremendous logistics costs to get stuff to you from kind of Nashville to wherever you are. And so, you know, that's, that's, that's kind of rough. Everybody see the trade offs here, right? So, so yeah, so I get all these nice costs, but, you know, there's sort of this promise now, if we go to the right similarly, what are the advantages and disadvantages here? Right? Like, if I sort of think about the picture of the picture

Speaker 8  24:02  
on the right answer, say, First would be the promise time you certainly will be able to meet those.

Unknown Speaker  24:07  
Yeah, just closer to the customer. So great. What else?

Speaker 8  24:19  
Oh, what's bad name? Okay, so, of course, commies of scale, yeah, that's from a cost standpoint, obviously. So

Speaker 1  24:25  
almost everything that's good over here is bad here, and almost everything that's bad here is kind of good over here, right? So, what's, what's, what's, what's good here? Like, I mean, risk is actually disaggregated now, right? You're doing the opposite of pooling. You're actually disaggregating risk, right? So the risk is disaggregated, okay? So that's that's one issue, and you have this economies of scale effectively, right? Why? Because you're kind of running this like, much smaller warehouse. Also, by the way, there'll be other issues, like, typically, these are closer to, like, big population centers, it's going to be more expensive to run. Labor is going to be more expensive. Land is going to be more everything's going to be more expensive, right? So everybody see this kid kind of, like, this interesting trade off, right? Okay,

Speaker 1  25:20  
how do we get, how do we get the faster footwork, right, like, how do we get the faster focus dark? Find some sort of hybrid

Unknown Speaker  25:32  
to have big centers near your major locations that have the most popular inventory of

Unknown Speaker  25:42  
hotels. Question

Speaker 1  25:44  
is, does that actually solve anything? I

Speaker 4  25:48  
think it solves the most important thing you will invest in

Speaker 1  25:53  
yourself. Let me push back a little bit, right? So effectively, you're saying, I have a huff, right? And I have all these folks, by the way, you need this for a variety of different reasons. But let's focus on a reason for a wide amount of fear, which is inventory account, right? So at some level, if I'm actually going to get stuff to, you know, in a short amount of time, it's not very helpful. If the stuff is actually sitting in the hospital, it has to be the scope. So what that means is, each of those spokes is actually going to still carry some safety stock, right? Imagine you if there was that r2 policy we were talking about last month. What did sigma look like? I'm sorry, what did safety stock look like? It's the same case, sigma business, right? And so one way or the other, you're still, even though you have the hub and spoke, you're still going to carry, like, a lot of safety stuff, right? Because of the reasons we were talking about earlier. Yeah, I could have a hub and spoke, which was Rashad idea, you're saying, again, that doesn't like solve for this, right? You see everybody see this, right? So, yes, there's a hub and spoke and kind of whatever. It's just like a layer of interaction at some level. Because if I sort of think about the inventory I need to carry right, per what we discussed last week, I still have to carry it close to the customer. I'm going to deliver it quickly, right? How to do this both

Speaker 2  27:11  
and yet, you have this filter today, then you can just look at each period instead of saying okay to

Unknown Speaker  27:22  
customer in three days, you get hub spoke and then

Speaker 1  27:29  
sure, ah, so remember that games were different. The reason we got a game at yangio was not because, you know, splitting up that individually, right? It was because, basically, we were able to reach a decision, right? We're able to wait to peak at the max. That's not like for most of the stuff they're trying, yeah, some of the things are probably the things that have, like some coral shots the water does not see. You're not going to get that. You're still going to carry the inventory, right? You will get a tiny amount of games for sort of a reason to imagine, but it's second order. It's not going to fix. And why, we're trying to figure out why is just remember, you're still carrying casings, right for that r2 decision, still needed to carry about safety stop, right? And need to carry that safety stop at each of these folks were a little bit problematic. Good though. Alexis, I would say that it

Speaker 4  28:27  
is important to forecast, for example, the media way, if somebody will have subscriptions, you understand what you need and why. Sure.

Speaker 1  28:44  
I mean, we can't argue against demand forecasts. And so let's assume that, you know, we've invested everything we can in demand forecast. The problem is this, that doesn't take away variability, right? There's still going to be endemic variability that's not going to go to zero. Okay? So, like, if you sort of think about it, you know, think about like, keep coming back, you know. Think about that bus pulling up in front of, like, Whopper with the Whoppers, right on the first day of class, right? So Cynthia, I'm never going to read predict that, irrespective of how sophisticated I am. And so there's going to be at the scale they are operating on this sort of think about it. Okay, so let's imagine that you wanted delivery in three hours, right? And I think I was talking to you guys about jelly beans yesterday. You don't know when I'm gonna order jelly beans. And it's like, and let's say, you know, so how many people in this neighborhood, you know, want a two pound bag of jelly beans? How many people want 222 pound bags of jelly Not that many, right? But having it is actually very valuable, right? It makes me really love Amazon and so on and so forth. Now, to satisfy that, we're going to keep having to carry these three two pound jelly bean bags with them, right? They're not it's going to be very hard to predict. Let's say the only people that want this are like, you know, I don't know me and you know Rashad, because we both have hard to, hard To forecast, right? So I have an

Speaker 9  30:14  
idea again. Williams, just speak in my mind, so

Unknown Speaker  30:30  
centralized,

Speaker 9  30:37  
so you can decide which like you still have the physical location, but you can decide physical location centralized. I think

Speaker 1  30:55  
it is centralized, though, right? I think I can't argue with that. That makes perfect sense, right? But that's not going to like, they've already done that, right? Like, at some level, it's hard to argue against that, right? Basically, what you're saying is optimize carefully and collect all the data that you have. And indeed, that's very important to them, and they had huge investments in doing that. But what I was trying to point out was, there's like, fundamental uncertainty, right? It doesn't matter how smart you are, it's just like, fundamental uncertainty. And like, how do we deal with that kind of fundamental

Speaker 6  31:26  
uncertainty? Sandra, can I try to say, is it because of the last mile delivery that improved, because afterwards, that you can actually have a smaller warehouse that you think that's important at large,

Speaker 1  31:38  
that's still our like, Hub and Spoke business, right? And the point I was making earlier is not going to necessarily solve the problem over here, you're going to still have to carry a ton of tax safety stock. Okay, let's back up, and let's think about the following, okay, what do they need to basically provide their customers now, agreed, I have some weird, heavy tailed tastes, right on, like, you know, whatever jelly beans or whatever it is, but to a large extent, right? Like, what, what are they trying to accomplish over here with all of this, right? Like, from a customer perspective, like, how does this tie with the discussion we had yesterday, about, right? Like, what we care about as consumers, that's all so I think it's building from what they were saying that if you keep inventory of 100% of your goods, and you keep inventory of, I don't know, 8% of the inventory of

Speaker 3  32:34  
average people consume and keep distributed, so you increase the k sigma overall, because you are trading this inventory, because you are not having inventory in all the warehouses,

Speaker 1  32:51  
so you are just having a few Okay, so what you're saying, If I would kind of try and take away something from what you're saying, what you're saying is, basically, why don't we sort of think about this, as opposed to thinking about individual products? Why don't we think about like a portfolio, right? So we have lots of products, right? And maybe we should be thinking differently about different products, right? So let's back up and sort of say again the question I originally asked, and I'll come back to what you said. It's like, what did we care about yesterday. We cared about availability, right? We care about an assortment being available to us and access to it really quickly, right? That's, that's what we care about. As I said, Yes, I care about weird things, but to a large extent, right? So they have, like, 300 million odd skews. How many products do you think most people care about up to 300 million ops cube. Something really small, right? So, in fact, here's a picture. Okay, here's a picture, and the scales are kind of hidden, but let me tell you what this is, a picture about Amazon, by the way. Okay, it's stale because it's hard to get this kind of data right. So this is stale by about seven or eight years, but nonetheless, it's an Amazon picture. Okay, and let me tell you what this is. So what we've done over here is, okay, we've taken all the items and we've kind of sorted them by popularity. Okay, so for the yellow curve, they've been sorted by popularity in terms of revenue. And for the magenta curve, they've been sorted by popularity. I'm sorry, it's the other way around. For the yellow curve, they've been for the magenta curve, they've been sorted by popularity in order of revenue. For the yellow curve, they've been sorted by popularity in the order of uh, just quantity sold. Okay, so they've been sorted by popularity. And what we're sort of plotting on the y axis, okay, is for again, yellow curve, the percentage of cumulative dollars of revenue covered by those products, and for the magenta curve, the percentage of cumulative units of product sold covered by those products. Okay, so let's just focus on one of these curves. Let's just focus on the yellow curve. For instance, right? What's the yellow curve actually saying? The yellow curve is saying that basically about 10% of their products, right, essentially cover 85% of their sales, roughly, okay, that's, that's, that's basically what this what this curve says, okay, given this data, how do you want to think about this issue? Go ahead. You only stop 10 or 15% of your actual everything else is direct

Unknown Speaker  35:42  
from here. From, either from the major output or direct

Speaker 1  35:44  
comprehe. Okay, good. So if we sort of thought about this as let's call this a products, you know, let's call this, you know, V products. Let's call everything here C products. Okay, so what you're saying is, I take the A products margin, and you want to carry the products where on the right hand side here, right? So I basically carry all my A products here, right? Why is it okay for me to carry my A products over here? These sort of this risk disaggregation issue I was talking about going

Unknown Speaker  36:21  
to be your highest volume here. Up.

Speaker 1  36:25  
Yeah, there's enough volume over here that I start aggregating risk even at the smaller level, right? These are popular enough that I can aggregate their risk even close enough to you, right? That's, that's essentially what's kind of going on. Okay, okay, very good. And so basically, I get both the promise time and I take advantage of that risk disaggregation issue. Now it's still going to be more expensive to set up that warehouse, but something's got to do. So that is going to have to do, right? And by the way, to kind of deal with that. You can do all sorts of funky things, right, like with many different stages and this and that, but the first order thing is, I take all my eight products, I put them close to right, and that's okay, because all the risk is disaggregated. The scale is sufficient that that risk kind of gets averaged up. What do you want to do with the B products? Arjun, okay, so put the B products over here, right? And over here, basically, I can kind of carry them, because risk is pool, right? So, yes, like, they're lower volume, but now I'm pulling risk around, like a much larger geographic area, and so I'm kind of pulling, you know, pulling the risk of these products. And so, you know, I'm still going to pay a price on promise time. But let's, let's kind of talk about that, that issue in a quick second. Okay, what do you want to do with the c so, those are the A products or the B products. What do you want to

Unknown Speaker  37:52  
do with the C products? Okay,

Speaker 1  37:56  
that's, that's kind of one way, one way of doing it. What else would you want to do with the C products, the camera, yeah, exactly. So what's remarkable about these C products is this was kind of the genesis of that marketplace, right? So listen, like we don't want to be in the business of selling C products, right? You sell the C products, right? And so you'll have all kinds of people selling C products and carrying inventory, and, in fact, paying Amazon to store the inventory, right? And this is like crazy stuff, by the way. Okay, this is a side note. You know, about three or four years ago, I was sort of very interested in this business of like, there's this roaring business of rolling up, you know, Amazon and Shopify merchants, which I kind of curious about so since I was curious about it, I decided to set up a couple of these things on my own. Alibaba, my garage is still filled with constantly doing some of this stuff, right? So a garage is so if anybody wants a free coffee pitcher, like really nice coffee pitcher, Alibaba, not learned a lot from doing it, right? I learned a lot from doing it. And really, what's going on with the with this over there is, like, one, you know, really, basically, they're saying, Look, I have these merchants, and these merchants have a better sense of, like, what's going to be demanded and what's not going to be demanded, and declaring the risk in any case, right? By the way, what happens to you know, in this picture over here is a C product, always a C product, right? So tell me like, what could happen? Yeah. Derek, so what you see is, when a product goes to my

Unknown Speaker  39:38  
C products, Amazon will either, like, make

Speaker 2  39:41  
a copy of it, or they'll buy the company, or they'll basically just start competing and push that person out.

Speaker 1  39:49  
So not only are they actually seeming on kind of like the inventory over here, they get to experiment in detail for free, right? Basically they'll get, like, a bunch of like, you know me to like, mess around and, like, carry a bunch of stuff, right? And then they'll figure coffee pots of shit we definitely don't want to carry, right? But there's this other thing, right? Remember talking to this merchant in Toronto who invented some weird kind of contraption, kind of pickle things. Okay? So when you like pickle things, sometimes jars can explode, right? You had this weird contraption to avoid it. It turned out to be, like, super popular, right? Like, just, I like you talking about how Amazon ripped them off. And so there's a lot of that stuff that can happen. So not only are you kind of carrying stuff in, carrying stuff in the field, it's kind of free learning

Speaker 1  40:58  
for Oh, wow. So very well. That's pretty awesome. So anyways, by the way, the reason I was doing this was I was trying to figure out if there was value in rolling up these businesses. And I, through my experience, I learned firsthand that I did not think there was value. And I'm really glad I dodged that bullet, because then two years later, all these things kind of collapsed. So, you know, glad to kind of like dodged that bullet, but, but in any event, back to this picture of you've got the AW, the C, but what are the consequences of this setup from a cup? From a customer's perspective, what does this mean for a customer? Like, if you're a customer, what does this mean for you? Alexi,

Unknown Speaker  41:41  
if you need something from

Speaker 1  41:47  
what are the chances looking at this picture, what are the chances that you'll find everything you want really quickly? Looking at this picture, what is it precisely like? 85% right? Everybody see what I'm saying. There's like, an 85% chance that, like, what you want, like, you could get it super fast, right? And with the remaining percentage, it's not going to be super slow. Also, it's going to take like, a couple days, all right? Now here's the interesting thing, I'm always going to kind of like argue with my cell phone, right? So we go. with myself over there, right? So we could you,

Speaker 1  45:11  
okay, at least. What this return tells me is this is sort of a back the markets made that effectively, these are the only guys that are going to survive. But that's basically what I read from this, right? It says, Yeah, you know, they're both kind of operationally good, but these guys are providing so much more value than the long term, we don't see these guys really survive, right? Like, if you look at this kind of difference. And so my question to you is, when I look at something like this, and if you're Walmart, what do you do? I want to spend the rest of the 40 minutes I have with you discussing just that. Okay, so if you're Walmart, right, what do I do? Right? So everybody see the problem of me? Okay, you're running a and Walmart's not like a tiny company, right? It's like 500 billion in revenue. It's a pretty serious company. So if you're the CEO of Walmart, okay, how do you how do you approach this? Get like a new hand. Guess wrong answer. Hasn't spoken to why don't you start us out so as

Unknown Speaker  46:28  
well, not basically,

Speaker 1  46:34  
I'm sorry, say again, Walmart has its own strength. Okay? This is basically, you know, in the city stores where people

Unknown Speaker  46:40  
do visit. And

Speaker 1  46:43  
right now, what they're doing is that big commerce, basically so good. I don't know if I want to call that a strength. I want to call that a difference, right? So Walmart definitely has stores, right? That's the difference, I guess other stores like an asset or a liability.

Speaker 1  47:05  
Okay, so let's discuss Walmart research.

Unknown Speaker  47:26  
That's

Speaker 1  47:31  
okay. Let me see what you said. So what you're basically saying is, let us back up, right? So your idea is basically they can deliver faster consumers, and they can deliver faster because they have stores. So we're saying, like, one direction to compete is just deliver faster. Okay, good. So how do they compete? Like, start making a list over here. You're saying one is time. That's basically, right. I like it, so I eventually want to compete on time. That's your idea for this discussion.

Speaker 1  48:12  
Uh, by the way, for this discussion, I'm happy to stick with math America, right? Like, because the discussion has been very mathematical focused, right? Just to kind of keep it, I guess soon as you make it International, the discussion is very tricky, because consumer bases can be very, very different. Labor pools can be very, very different, and so it's very hard to have a unified discussion, right? So the first Joe, I guess Walmart has omnichannel feasibility,

Speaker 3  48:38  
so you can pick up in store, apply online, where Amazon used to have all sorts of things, where Amazon has to ship

Unknown Speaker  48:51  
that in terms of hacking, do that package or return

Unknown Speaker  48:57  
it, you're able to do that. I think that's

Speaker 1  49:03  
why Amazon how I try to make sure I understand this. Why is this interesting to you as a consumer? Again? Why is

Speaker 3  49:09  
it interesting? Because I'm able to return for Walmart or

Speaker 1  49:13  
for actual Walmart or Yeah, so, exactly. So, why? Why is, why are you know? Why? Why is this omnichannel thing relevant to the consumer? Because you're able to buy things online or in store, I see so you're seeing like the convenience of having a store to drop something off that, but

Unknown Speaker  49:32  
also for a business is easier for them to just have people come to them to request things or to pick up. Okay,

Speaker 1  49:44  
so you're okay, fine. So you're saying, like, you know, some consumers may want the option of, like,

Unknown Speaker  49:48  
driving up to the store, maybe, I

Unknown Speaker  49:50  
guess my point was more like a business, like, it's easier if people

Speaker 1  49:56  
download package from you than you sending it. Carlos,

Unknown Speaker  50:04  
maybe using similar to Amazon instead of

Speaker 1  50:11  
useful stores as very tactically. I'd like to sort of step back and ask what I'm trying to ask over here is the following, okay, whatever we do right needs, we need to start with something that makes a difference

Unknown Speaker  50:23  
to the consumer, right?

Speaker 1  50:25  
And so how we do it is a different story. But like, one thing I want to kind of make sure of is that what we're doing matters to the consumer, and you are all consumers, and you reflected on whether you you know what you cared about with respect to Amazon, right? Like, if I'm Doug McMillon, what do I need to pull off as Doug McMillan, I need to make you my customer, as opposed to an Amazon customer. So whatever you tell me, right? Like, I, let's forget about how we accomplish it. Let's, let's talk about, like, what the goal is, and why that matters to the consumer. Okay, so with the time thing, I understood that the AMI channel sort of, right, yeah, this is kind of where my head's at Shiva, not relevant to me, but I still

Unknown Speaker  51:03  
feel that you would like to

Unknown Speaker  51:09  
go out. You're

Unknown Speaker  51:11  
just going there, just

Unknown Speaker  51:12  
as warm up

Unknown Speaker  51:14  
for the the

Speaker 1  51:17  
in store experience that could matter, that actually could, that could matter, right? Like, I mean, you know, physical experience not going anywhere, right? Like, we still want that. That's kind of been around for quite some time. Today, I'm not questioning the utility of that. That could have utility, right? I think mama or Sam's

Speaker 9  51:44  
Club is kind of like a selection system. If I walk in, I know what I'm expecting. Like it's, for example, the MoMA mentors, basically, they are of standard and the value and the sense of, maybe it's better quality. So Amazon, it has pounds, millions of products, okay, to do my self selection. It takes time.

Speaker 1  52:08  
Good, good. I like this. Actually, that's a very interesting idea, right? So what you're saying is basically, they serve as a curator, right? They curate products, right? And, okay, let's, I want to push on that curation thing for a second, right? So they curate products. So by the way, at the time the omnichannel, the intro experience I start, I heard like initial arguments of why this might, they might be able to do this on the curate products. Help Me Understand, I see the value, but help me understand why Walmart has any hope of doing this better than Amazon,

Speaker 9  52:52  
because Amazon has to make tons of products available to customers,

Speaker 1  52:56  
sure, yeah, but what is, what is good? Let's dig into your curation idea, right? What? What is inside your curation idea? It's basically that you figured out the right thing, and then presumably, you know, you figure out a cheap way of making this right, so now you have the right thing at a good price, correct? Why can't Amazon do the same thing in the sense that they, they already do this, right? Like the discussion we had earlier about the, you know, the device with the pickles, or whatever it is, right? Like, if they see something working, they'll just pick it up and make it themselves,

Unknown Speaker  53:34  
right? They carry a lot of long tail and brands, etc.

Speaker 1  53:36  
And my point is, like, they still, they also carry the curator, so,

Speaker 9  53:41  
yeah, I know, but I don't see them, so it's hard for me to trust okay.

Speaker 1  53:48  
So I like the idea. I think if you'd like shop on Amazon and sort of see Amazon's choice and this and that, right? And a lot of those things are actually things that they make themselves, right? So at some level, I think sure we could do this, and I kind of like the idea, but that specific approach, I'm having a hard time buying. I think there's a seed of something interesting there, though, right? Which is, you're kind of thinking about some sort of segmentation that's kind of what's going through your head. But I'm wondering, what are the segmentations? Lower membership fee for faster

Unknown Speaker  54:23  
delivery time. So

Unknown Speaker  54:26  
I'm thinking Walmart, plus you

Speaker 1  54:33  
just sort of think about this as price, right? You can just think about this as price. That's like a very simple, blunt kind of thing, right? It's a pretty blunt instrument. What do you guys think about price as a love and by the way, here's something I want to bear in mind. What they do is going to need to be a serious thing, right? Like, because we're not talking about like, like, like, kind of like continuous improvement that the company, right? We're talking about, like, basically survival, right? Like they've already been surpassed, right? Like Amazon's already overtaken them in terms of revenue, and so this is kind of like, what they do has to be, like, a big, bold play, right? So a very good friend of mine is actually an investor at big and he was, like, the first investor in this company called check.com which Walmart bought in 2016 if I'm not mistaken. And I still vividly remember, like chatting with him, like the day after, or two days after something like that, and congratulating him for this. And he was like, oh, no, no. You know, Walmart has more money than time, right? So, so the point being that they had, they're sitting on a ton of cash, or they need to, like, deploy that. Like, it needs to be, like, a big swing, right? Like, and so that's kind of the ideas we want over here. And price is fine, right? Which, that's a big swing, right? So then let's think about price for a second. Do you think price would work? Why not? Why not? Why would price not work? I mean, we all like cheap things, like, that was the core of your idea, right? Like, I'm going to buy this product because it's a high quality product and it's cheap, right? That's but, so what I'm saying is, let's just get into it. Like price as a level, what's, what's

Speaker 10  56:14  
wrong with that? James, I think over time, they're going to lose to Amazon, given Amazon's investment in efficiency and kind of that, that whole, like we're just talking about, on the warehouse investment. So maybe short term compete on price, but long term, it would be very difficult at

Speaker 1  56:30  
scale. Yeah. So price is going to be one thing. So first of all, like a price war, I think basically what you're saying is, who would win a price war? Yeah, right. You know that is that Amazon wins

Speaker 10  56:39  
the price floor, correct? But I do think Walmart could position themselves as a low cost provider speak to a potentially different consumer. Yeah?

Speaker 1  56:49  
So I do. It's actually quite interesting, because I don't know if it's the case anymore, but for the longest time, Walmart had more cash than Amazon, I don't know if that's still the case, right? So unclear to me, who survives longer, right? And if they get into a price war, who wins? That's that's the discussion, right? So first of all, there's another thing bad about price, right? So let's say you get into a price war, then there's a race to the bottom as well. So that there's another issue with that. So let's, let's put that aside. Who's asking? You know, vendor price war? You know who wins that? Daniela, if you have to understand your customer base, see whether

Unknown Speaker  57:30  
they value more price. I

Speaker 1  57:37  
Good, good, good. But I guess what I'm trying to say is, for the longest time, you know, Amazon was selling things like at super cheap prices, arguably losing money. And you could just do that again. And so the question is, like, who would bring that book, right? Like, twice, a very powerful level, right? Like, it's an extraordinarily powerful level, right? Like, if somebody told you, you get the same thing on that Walmart, like, it typically takes 5% less, I promise you, by the end of the week, all of you would have the app, great. Like, because you're sensible

Speaker 1  58:17  
people, so other than the person that bought the Iron Bridge map, yeah and

Speaker 10  58:38  
up, yeah, most of us are so, yeah, most people bring by the two.

Speaker 1  58:43  
I completely agree. I completely agree, right? And so the price needs to be largest, right? So let me, let me talk about Michael's idea, right, or Michael's point. Michael's point is that, like, small things aren't going to move consumer behavior Right. Like, the membership being, like, 20 bucks cheaper or whatever, that's too small. And lots of people run into this right, like, sort of like giving gamification type ideas, you know where, oh, you know what, if you do this, you got like, a 5% chance of getting $100 that doesn't actually be consumed. What I'm talking about in here with price is, like, like, me, like cheaper, right? Like, every day is, like, basically 5% cheaper. Everything is that works, right? Why? Because there's price elasticity really small on the margin and one, and it doesn't mean anything, right? We're talking about a significant kind of move in price. The question is, who survives? James? Do not

Unknown Speaker  1:00:11  
it will take some market, because there are market. So

Speaker 1  1:00:17  
I would like to kind of remove team you from the discussion. I'll tell you why I think Timu is a bit of a confounder in this discussion, since a lot of the low prices they offer effectively benefit from, to a large extent, starting the law, right? So they found like, various loopholes, right? One big thing is kind of avoiding import cases on imported goods that give them artificial precedent. So I know they've been removed, so I want to kind of keep seeing you out of the out of the mix. They're also not like, held to the same sort of standards as you know some of these other players, right? So for instance, with a company like Amazon or Walmart, they're actually reasonably careful about the sourcing of their products, because, actually, they had a lot of trouble, you know, if they're sourced from bad places. And again, TV doesn't actually see that oversight. And so there's, like, I think TV benefits from, like, an advantage over there. I think the one thing you can take away from TV is that people love a game, right? People really love it, right? It doesn't matter, like, my dad buys crap on TV, right? Like, I mean, you know, but like, you buy, like, right? So, so anyway, back to press, who wins the war? You guys are kind of dodging the question.

Speaker 7  1:01:39  
Jillian, yeah, any one of my experiences, I worked for my gallery that is, like the direct competition of Amazon in Latin America, yeah. And what we did there were, like, basically two things. The first one was developing ecosystem solutions that was fully integrated supply chain, yeah, banking solution, etc. And the other thing were, like, complete obsession with the consumer, and the SLAs for the for the consumer, like we took it really seriously, the 24 hour delivery, and that was

Speaker 1  1:02:14  
like the so you're back to time. Okay, I promise, Phil, we'll get back to you, right? I want to finish up the discussion on price, if you guys were elected. So for the last time, that's the answer I'm interested in. Right now we can get to other things on price the same way

Speaker 2  1:02:32  
that Walmart can provide the same way that you think of a restaurant versus I think the food delivery becomes so expensive, nobody will stay on gap. Everybody will go to the restaurant. But if the restaurant becomes more expensive, they will still go to the restaurant. And there's a human experience long term, might succeed and might prevail. However, I think that

Speaker 1  1:03:06  
by doing so good, I like what you're saying. Okay, so Giacomo is actually making a really good case. I like, I like, what you're saying. Okay, so Giacomo point, if I understand it, correct me. If I'm wrong, what you're saying is basically one thing to notice, is that in since we're talking about North America, right? Is that last one liquidity is actually expensive, right? This is very different from the rest of the world, right? So you think about all these business models in China and India and India and so on and so forth. A lot of these sort of like business models are made possible by super cheap last mile liquidity, right? Whereas that last mile liquid is very expensive, very expensive in Europe, right? And so one way sort of thinking about this is, you're saying Amazon relies heavily on last mile liquidity. You could view this as a weakness, right? And sort of bet against me, right? You say, hey, that's only going to get more expensive. And so I'm going to kind of bet on cheap prices, but people coming into the store, so I think that's a bet for them, kind of winning the price floor by doing what they're good at, right? And I think they are kind of making bets aligned with a little bit offline as well. I think there's a bet in the opposite direction too, right? The fact in the opposite direction is basically that Amazon subsidizes this business, right? So they make money through a whole bunch of different channels, and they effectively use that money to subsidize what they're doing. Now, this is not legal, actually, in the truest sense of the word. And in fact, the previous administration was in the process of suing them. Now stop right, but the previous administration was suing right because they were effectively subsidizing the retail business through other businesses that they were that they were running you're not supposed to do if you do if they are allowed to do this, some of the other businesses are, like, profit stickers, right? Like, like the AWS business, for instance, that's like, blowing up, right? And so they could use this to kind of just sustain themselves, and they have used it in the past to sustain themselves. So I think the part with prices, right? There's a pretty shaky one. This is, like, scary. You can see reasons why Walmart might win, right? And I really liked your reason. I think it's spot on, right? You can also see scary reasons why Amazon might win, right? And so that's that makes it kind of unattractive. Another thing that makes this unattractive is as soon as you enter a price floor, you completely change consumer expectations, right? So, yes, you win like, you've win one in this sort of scorched earth way, where at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself, What's the prize that you're kind of left with, right? And this isn't, this isn't that that you know, as as attractive as a result, a lot of you were talking about time, and that's kind of how you started out, right? I want to kind of come back to that, okay? I think really what you were saying on time, like, like, let me ask you this, right? What would make any app, right? Like, attractive to you, Visa, V, Amazon, right on time. Like, what would your expectations be? What would you want, right? So, so Michael, right. Like, do you have you don't have the Walmart app, right? Yeah, give me what you said earlier, you downloaded

Unknown Speaker  1:06:14  
it. Yeah, great. So

Speaker 1  1:06:18  
on the on the time front, what would they need to offer you in that app? So you kind of download it and keep it What would you what would you need to have 24 hours Europe, I would expect, and by the way, when I

Speaker 3  1:06:33  
came here, I from home, yeah, from Israel, yeah, things from Amazon and Walmart, depending on the lowest price. So I actually went for everything and checked and Walmart took like, three and a half weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:49  
By the time I got it, I was like, I don't even remember I bought

Unknown Speaker  1:06:53  
this. So they were really poor. And

Speaker 1  1:06:56  
watch this so they were reading before. They weren't focused same day, two hours. Yeah, I'd imagine it's in this few hours, right? And you want a few hours on, like, kind of most of the stuff that you would potentially want, right? So, like, if you take two hours on like, one out of 20 things you search for, and it's sort of like, oh, this is, like, the cheaper Prime subscription. Why would I do this? And so not only do you need to get it quit, you need to get it sort of quit by most things, right? And at the start of this discussion, you know, Rebecca, sort of, you know, pointed out that, you know, you have stores, right? So he said, Look, I can offer things to you fast and I have stores, and the stores would be much closer to you, right? Like, if we think about where we're standing over here, there's, I think, two Walmart stores within like six miles of us, right? Like, one in Lynn, one in Quincy. Okay, so, yeah, so there's two Walmart stores pretty close by. What do you guys think of this study? Right? Like, because the shape of the idea is, it is something that has a lot of value to the consumer, right? It's a value add, as opposed to, kind of making something cheaper or something like that, right? We love going in that direction, because when you add value, you get scale. Things get cheaper, blah, blah, blah, right? So, so it's a value add, and it builds on something you're perceiving as a strength, which is the scope. That's what you said. So I want to dig into that idea for the rest of our time. Let's, let's think about that that seems to have the most promise, actually, of all of this sounds like genuine valley, but I think there's the devil's in the details. So what do you think about this? You've

Unknown Speaker  1:08:52  
not spoken

Speaker 2  1:08:54  
I well, you can basically convert your source into warehouses. And actually one of the startup, which is quite a big here, and there's a replication back in Russia as well. It is called Instacart. They did quite that for what they do, they actually deliver. So they use the warehouse as the dark store. So we say, so they pick the item that you need on demand, and they deliver

Speaker 1  1:09:14  
it. So to be clear, Instacart is purely a logistics company. There's like a last mile company. Yeah, right. But I hear what you're saying, right? I just want to kind of just keep back, keep that kind of stuff, right? I want to focus on the storage. So you're saying, Take stores and convert them to warehouses effectively, right? Okay, so two questions there, right? Does that solve our problem? Okay, what's involved in making it a warehouse? So that's kind of on the Walmart side. The second side is, could Amazon catch up? Maybe we deal with the second thing first, right? So is this a sustainable advantage? Used to be Amazon? What do you think there? And then we can get into, like, some of the stuff you're saying, right? So the story is, do it faster and you have stores. That's the idea, right? So my question is, is that sustainable needs to be Amazon?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11  
What do you think do

Speaker 8  1:10:17  
what do you think you did speak but whatever, I don't know how this connects to this. Yeah, I'm thinking about because of the proximity Walmart has to consumers. Yeah, if I were to compete with Amazon, I would look through our categories. What, exactly, what are the most let me go to the end. The end will be, I'll probably carry perishable

Speaker 1  1:10:37  
items that I think Amazon has. So you think about, how do you operate the business? What I'm saying is, should we even get into this right? And so let's play this movie forward, right? Let's do some light gaming. So let's say I'm Walmart. I decided to make this movie, right, documentary right? So basically, I take my warehouses, my stores, I convert like two thirds of the store to, like a warehouse or whatever. Okay, if I'm Amazon, how do I respond to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06  
this? Cameras? Yeah, they've demonstrated they can do that.

Speaker 1  1:11:11  
Okay, but buying a warehouse in the middle of Cambridge is probably a hard thing to do. It's just not available, right? What would you do if you're Amazon, what have they done? Whole Foods? Why do you think they bought Whole Foods, right? Yeah, they're not sleeping. That's why they bought Whole Foods, okay? But here's where it actually you get to some hope, right? So it actually takes time to get this stuff up and running, and nothing's permanent, right? Like, there's no advantage that's going to be permanent. But like, getting this up and running takes time. So Amazon bought Whole Foods in 17, I think, I think in 2017 Okay, they've got, they got Whole Foods fully onboarded onto, kind of their system of doing things and like, like the CTO of hopefully, again, close call. Okay, they got it fully up and running in like 2023, right? So it takes time. And how many stores are we talking about? Like, in the US, maybe North America, total on the order of four or 500 stores, right? Like Amazon has two, like 20 times 8000 stores. So yes, I could kind of acquire my way into kind of buying these, these locations, but getting it up and running, it takes a long time, right? And your behavior is going to change much, much faster as a consumer, right? So this is actually something with promise, at least harder for Amazon to just simply acquire that that capacity. So we're back to kind of Dimitri, sort of notion over here now, which is, I've decided to convert my scores into kind of warehouses, right? One benefit of this is obvious, right? The benefit is, basically, I'm close to my consumer blah, blah, blah, I can deliver efficiently, so on and so forth. So that's one big investment that we do, right? So let's say these guys decided to focus on time, speed, whatever, right? Let's say they focused on one investment in stores as warehouses. This is a big investment. Okay, good. What other investments do they need to make this case, the experience

Speaker 3  1:13:21  
that we have in Chile with Walmart. They partnership with, like, an Insta card from Chile work really good, like you can have everything from Walmart in four hours. Okay, good. They invest in they didn't

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36  
invest in the technology. Nice

Speaker 3  1:13:39  
partnership. I think more of a must invest in technology in order to compete with Amazon

Unknown Speaker  1:13:45  
company nowadays.

Speaker 1  1:13:48  
So investing, I'm sold. I'm so right. So basically, they're sort of like a last mile logistics piece. And your point is that I don't even need to acquire it. There's probably enough liquidity out there. I could build a marketplace. Maybe I partner with Uber or something like that, right? By the way, that's that's also more complicated than it seems, but it's doable, right? To your point, there are people that have done okay, so, so maybe I do this, I guess, though. So, so, okay, these first two things make sense. What about like, what you carry at the store? Help me

Speaker 6  1:14:22  
with that? Sandra, I want to say something, because I actually like consumer experience, and I deliberate to become a Walmart member, just for the experience of being in America, and I realized that it go online, you have the same limit delivery in and then you will bring you to ins. So I delivered you to try to pricing, actually pricing for intro cars have got bit more expensive than you buy on the same day delivery. And then when you click on the product, like it's actually when you go to store, is similar to your same day delivery. But then there's a large ring of product. They actually sold five of third party and when you click on them, somehow that one of the Korean products, they asked me to sign on to other link, and you become an advertisement company on a third party company. That I find is amazing, that they actually carry a lot more product on the internet

Speaker 1  1:15:08  
than so you're talking about building like a marketplace for

Speaker 6  1:15:13  
merchants, yes. So they have done, Amazon, done, and that means for a customer they don't buy, sure.

Speaker 1  1:15:21  
So you could, you could kind of build a marketplace, not unlike Amazon. But back to my question about, like, what would we carry at the stores? What inventory would you want to carry at the stores? Let me start with Michaela and then go to Rashad. They should get his hand up.

Speaker 1  1:15:46  
But remember, the stores are not functioning as warehouse, right? Like in our new approach, the stores are warehouse. Let's say this let's, for argument's sake, let's make them fully rare, sure. Okay, they're fully warehouses. What sort of inventory you want to carry? In fact, let's do this body start. Okay. So as I said, there's two Walmart stores closed here. There's one in, you know, in Lynn, I think I'm pointing the right direction. One in Quincy there, right? So it's one in Lake money, Quincy. Now, both these stores, by the way, both these neighborhoods, are very blue collar neighborhoods. They're like classic like very blue collar Boston neighborhoods, and what's carried in the store sort of reflect the fact that they're blue collar. My question is, now, if the store in Berlin is boarded up and made a warehouse, okay, what's the inventory we want to carry that store? Does it change relative to what they were carrying? That's the crux of my question, John, you're saying yes, yes, okay, how does it change and why? So carry products to someone

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53  
from products to someone, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:16:58  
so there's going to be people from like, all these cookie neighborhoods, right? I want to buy like, stuff, and they don't want to buy the same stuff that, you know, guys in Quincy and, like, right? And so now they need to change what they carry. Actually, it's a little bit problematic, way, because what what happens to kind of the breadth of the assortment they need to carry. It expands, right? Okay, you see a problem here, right? See how disaggregation so it's going in the wrong direction, right? Everybody see this right, like, so the game we played, right? So there's a nice game that we started playing right, which was move faster, which means that if you come come to, like, kind of this picture over here, where did it go? Right. Sorry, way back, right. If you come to this picture over here, right, we're basically disaggregating these guys even further Right? Like, if you think about it visually, right? The notion of this guy is like, relative to like the Boston area is like a warehouse sitting in Springfield. It's like 90 odd miles, right? And now I say, take that warehouse that was 90 odd miles away, and we're going to break it up into like 20 warehouses that cover, like the Boston, Greater Boston, like metro area, whatever it is, right? So that's going to result in further disaggregation of demand, right? And so, yes, I can deliver things quickly, but I have, like, a, you know, I have this blow up in, like, safety stock, right? Everybody see this issue? How do we deal with that? Everybody see the problem? Yeah. How do we deal with that?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40  
Alexey crystal,

Speaker 4  1:18:51  
Walmart has more data because we have information from previous class that only 20% people buy online.

Speaker 4  1:19:06  
I do, yes, okay, based on this data, they could select the products because right?

Speaker 1  1:19:16  
Because, think about, yes, they could come up with better forecasts and so on and so forth. But when you disaggregate to this level, there's like, fundamental volatility, right? It's like, my purchase, I keep running back to my purchase of the jelly beans, right? So that that's like, you're not, you're on the forecast, right? Like, like, yes, if you look at the jelly bean jar that's sitting on my desk at home, you could probably forecast, right. Like, that's very hard for

Speaker 4  1:19:43  
them to track, only based on 20% Walmart, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:19:52  
I'm getting what you're saying. I'm getting what you're saying, and I'm conjuring by saying, Look, you can build a very good forecast, perhaps better than Amazon, although that's questionable, but you're not going to resolve fundamental uncertainty, right? The problem that we have is that we want to deliver quickly. Check, nice. I like that. Takes advantage of a resource we have stores close to customers. Check, I like that, right? Because it's hard for these other guys to replicate. But there's a problem with this, which is further disaggregation of inventory. So that's the one thing that's left. And I'm kind of asking myself, How do we deal with this one thing that's left, right? What are your thoughts?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:31  
Yeah, for example, anticipating

Speaker 1  1:20:39  
the behavior of purchasing, of the presence of these small SKUs. Let's try this. Let's try this. Okay, let's think about how the system works, right? And later on my way, I'll share, like, some sophisticated stuff with you guys, which you can read on your own time. Okay, let's think about how these systems work. These are called fulfillment systems. Okay, how does the fulfillment system work? Right? So I place my order, right? I'm sitting here, and I place the order for two bags, two pounds, each of 1000s, right? So that goes to some Walmart server. Where should the WalMart where should they fulfill my demand from? Ideally, close by, right? So they could pick the closest point. Does it have to be the closest point? No, right? So we can look at like maybe three or four stores around me, right? And sort of say, so let's say I'm sitting here, okay, and there's two stores, okay, there's the store in Quincy and there's the store in Lynn, like I was talking, okay, and let's say actually, both stores have

Speaker 1  1:21:53  
inventory, right? So the Quincy store has two bags left. And the, you know, the lint store has only one bag, okay, and the lint store is closing. Where should they fulfill from? Yeah, maybe the Quincy store, right. But they have, like, one year, you know, one bag left, blah, blah, blah, and they take the hit of like, you know, sending this thing, this tab, a little bit, whatever logistics thing that they're using a little bit further right? So the whole here, in terms of pooling is, you don't actually have to pool within a single store if you're going to pay for the logistics in any case, right? You may as well pull geographically across all of these stores, right, and trade off dynamically. Now this is actually, as it turns out, become, like, hugely important problem, okay, figuring out how to do this is like getting out on steroids. Why? Because you're making this decision on, like, you know, a single order by single order basis, right? So we've discussed all this, right? I just wanted to, kind of like wrap up with kind of what that intuition actually is, right? And then we go, we quit my hand joke, right? This is sort of the intuition, right? If you imagine carrying whatever product across a whole bunch of stores. And, you know, ecom DC. Think of the gray stuff as kind of like, the stock that you need to sell expected demand. And think of the white boxes as safety stock, okay, if these things were kind of carried, like, just independently of each other, right? What we're expecting is that at the end of like, you know, selling everything, most of the safety stock is still left right, because that's how safety stock works. It's just that you don't know in advance where you're going to have safety stock left and where you're not going to have safety stock left. Right. If you had a crystal ball somehow that told you that you're going to have safety stock left here and not there, you'd be great shape, right? The systems people are building today are like turbo charged versions of Daniel that tried to do exactly this. Okay? These systems rely very heavily on something called reinforcement learning. Okay, so there's a map here. Don't worry about the math. This is a book from a talk that I gave to a very large audience on this topic. But what's going into this math, right? I keep going back to the game of Tetris. Okay, so, by the way, this is a video from a computer Tetris player that I had the world record for the highest scoring computer Tetris player 22 years ago, right? And it uses reinforcement learning to make these decisions. This is a video from anyways, what's going on, if you think about what's going on over there, right? The Tetris piece is kind of like a memory, right? This actually makes your analogy. Hopefully you've all played Tetris, if you've not, what is actually happening in the game of Texas, right? In this game of Tetris, what you learn about is patience, right? You want to place things strategically right, like that Quincy decision. You want to wait to kind of get protectors and things like that. And this requires kind of understanding how the state of that board is going to evolve. That's actually exactly what's happening in these settings where the Tetris board, effectively is inventory positions across all of these different locations, right? And what you're trying to do over time is balance these inventory positions across the 30 warehouses that you have around you, essentially stores, so you can virtually pool risk across all those places. The funny thing is, and I'll just the last thing, I'll say, right, the people that started working on this problem were Amazon, okay? So many years ago, in 22,009 I did a project with a chief scientist at Amazon that actually led to kind of how they make these decisions. And I'll share that document with you, right? But today, that same, those same ideas, are actually being used when they're even more impactful at a place like gua okay? So just to summarize this entire discussion that we've had on, like, inventory, supply chains and so on and so forth, right? This is kind of the heart of retail, just like $2 trillion right? And the thing is constantly moving. Where things are today, is time to customer Okay? And you're sort of seeing the things, the ingredients needed to, kind of making that time to customer happen, right? But you can also play the game of understanding what's going to happen going forward, right? Like, how does an Amazon react to this? And so forth, and so this is, this is kind of, you know, hopefully plenty of food for thought. And when we come back, you know, Thursday, I'm actually going to end this kind of this section by talking about resilience. Okay, so if we're making long standing investments in supply chains, right, how do we make those those investments? And in today's world with tariffs and things like that, these are getting to be very hard decisions to make, and so I want to talk about a simple framework to approach that improvement. Okay, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:54  
Guys. Next, teacher gonna kill you never.
