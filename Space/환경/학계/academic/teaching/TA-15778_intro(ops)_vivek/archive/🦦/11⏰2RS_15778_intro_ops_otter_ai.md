# summary

The meeting covered the importance of resilience in supply chains, emphasizing proactive over reactive measures. A case study compared Nokia and Ericsson's responses to disruption, highlighting the value of alternative suppliers. The framework proposed quantifies potential impact and time to recovery for each supply chain node, focusing on high-impact, high-risk suppliers. Strategies discussed included alternative suppliers, vertical integration, and product design changes to reduce dependency. The session concluded with a framework for quantifying risk based on time to recovery, aiming to proactively identify critical supply chain points.

All right, so we have a lot of ground to actually cover today. So by the way, first of all, I wanted to kind of thank you guys for doing the survey. So I've actually been doing the survey for donkeys here, Charlie. I've just been doing it forever, wishing the program to do like, a class wide survey, and select me the first year they did a class wide survey, so there's a bit of a duplication, and they didn't tell me they'll do a class wide survey. So I want to make sure that, like, I could track feedback longitudinally. So I appreciate you doing two surveys. Great. I'm very, very thankful for that. I'll go over this at the end of the class, okay, so at the end. So basically, I mean, there's numbers, the numbers are good, and so on and so forth. So what's really interesting is you guys, like, provide tons of feedback, as you can tell, like, read it. So I've kind of read the feedback, and I want to kind of talk to you about the feedback. So I'll spend like, 15 minutes at the end of class, like doing that, so we'll do this at the end of class, right? But today is resilience, okay? So just to kind of give you a sense of what's left in the class, we have like, four or five sessions together. We're not too much time, right? And so what do I want to talk about in defining that problem? So this is actually a new session. This session is two, three years old. The reason for this session was kind of, at some level, the experience we all went through during covid, but then also, like a very personal experience. So not my last company, but the one before that. It was acquired by Nike. And so when covid happened, we could acquire

by Nike, made six months. And then when covid hit, there was a total nightmare with respect to kind of the supply chain. And you know, I ended up spending a good amount of my time with Nike leadership thinking about what their supply chain must be. And we're talking about like a very large investment. And so it was quite the experience actually thinking through this investment of, you know, four or $5 billion right? Which they hadn't really thought about before, and so I thought that basically made sense to sort of think about, like, is there some sort of framework we can think of around this? You don't find yourself in a spot in a corner, like when faced with something surprising, and that's like, at least, at the very least, you know, the grown ups about this, and we understand, you know, just in front of our face, you know what the trade offs are. Now what's, what's really kind of funny about this is, I was hoping to go ahead and give this session. When I created this session last year, two years ago, the conversation would be covid. But like, here we are again, right, like, you know, different sorts of shocks impacting supply chains, right, related to kind of tariffs and this and that I listed with another person, the CEO of S and P, you know, last, you know, last, last spring, this past spring. And you know, one of the things that we were talking about was basically this recipe, one big part of their business, a giant part of their business, is selling data, right? And there's huge demands for that data, because everything started changing so fast, people are scrambling to kind of understand, Oh, hey, you know, I can't buy this anymore from here. Where do I buy it from? And so on and so forth. So this is a big problem, and so what I thought I'd do is kind of give us a sense of what's a reasonable way of approaching this problem. Okay, how might we approach this problem? Because this is one of those things where, if you if you go back, if you think about, you know, this, this spectrum of risk. I drew very, very, maybe second class. I drew the spectrum of risk, right? I said, you know, you got predictable on the one side. And you know, then you have, like, something like, you know, predictable variability. You have sort of unpredictable variability, right? We've kind of been dealing with all this stuff so far, right? You know, what's at this end was sort of something I call kind of catastrophic variable, right? And it's kind of hard to sort of manage, that. It's not easy. And so what I'd like to kind of talk about today is, at some level, kind of a bare bones framework, okay, as bare bones as it can be, at some level to think about this. And the framework basically has sort of three pieces to it. Okay, so there's two proactive pieces. The third piece is kind of at some level, obvious, you know, a reactive piece. I'm not actually going to be focusing on the reactive piece. There's a lot of, you know, culture building this and that, you know that comes as part of this, and I'm not going to be able to do it justice at the time we but I think I mentioned a colleague of mine, lovey, who teaches a risk management class. He focuses quite a bit on that reactive piece. And so you can get that over there if you care about instead, what I'm going to do in today's session is really focus on kind of the proactive pieces. And specifically the first piece, okay, which is just simply kind of understanding, as we think about resilience, as we think about, you know, managing for this sort of tail risk over here, right? How do we even think through that tail risk and quantify where that risk even is, right? Like, how do we, how do we look at our company? How do we look at all our resources as at our infrastructure, and even characterize that like, Hey, this is where all that risk sits. Okay? So that's, that's, that's kind of the game plan for today. And then, having done this, I'm going to spend two sessions talking about the demand level. Okay, that's tomorrow. And the day after there, I'm going to be talking about a whole bunch of different demand levers. We've been worrying about the supply lever so far, but I want to talk about the demand lever, where that part is going to end. Is kind of thinking about what I call customer centricity, which is essentially thinking about managing a business, almost by managing individual customers of the business. I guess that's where that part is going to end. And then I want a section on generative AI. Okay, so that's, that's kind of, what's, you know, what's in, what's in, what's in front. Okay, questions before we get started, how's the simulation?

Who is, who is, was

like literally, do nothing.

I'll be having fun. What are you laughing?

It's tiring. I No one needs to sit. By the way,

I did hear that there's like some team that's meeting every hour, or something like that every two hours. Sounds crazy. I should participate in this next

I'm sorry, did you win? Of course.

All right, so

hopefully this is a good break from the simulation. All right, all right. So let's, let's start with basics. Okay, let's start with basics. So we're talking about resilience, resilience to what, right? So, really, you know, if I think about these sorts of things here, you know, colloquially, you might kind of call these things disruptions, right? These are things that perhaps you did not expect to happen. You know, are happening. Let's start here, as you think about a disruption, right? What are disruptions? Let's, let's give me, let's get going here, what is sort of a reasonable list of disruptions that you might want to actually think about, yeah, supply chain disruption, sure, but like, what's kind of causative to that? Natural disasters? Okay? So one thing is kind of like a natural disaster, right? So these are whatever earthquakes and storms and all that kind of crazy

stuff. I like that could be political, yeah, political shifts,

right? What are examples of that? Tariffs? Regimes, all the sort of stuff, right? This can be, this can be pretty significant, and kind of rather, the impact can be huge. As we're as we're as we're sort of as we're actively sort of seeing

sure good. What do you mean by this, like making

our code or developing a car that disrupts that?

Oh, okay, so you can think about disruptions in sort of a positive sense, right? And you can kind of think about technology disruptions, you know, that makes something much easier. That's great. Great. These sorts of things go in the other direction. You might find yourself heavily invested in something that's worthless, right? Good. I like that. Go ahead. Cost you. Good. So why would I do that?

So even though you are trying to hire

people, sometimes people cannot apply

for that job,

right, right? So, you know, those are bad things, for to be sure, but I guess the things I want to sort of focus on over here things that come as a big surprise, right? So what might result in, like a labor shortage that comes as a big surprise, I'm sorry, like a strike could be one, all right, a strike could be one. What else? Okay, right, so all of these things could sort of impact labor, any other significantly different things from here, go ahead,

quality issues, but probably were not expected into manufacturing the process. So, for example, you're building a medical device and is above the expected level. So then you just have to, like, take that product out and

like, say to me, why that would come as a surprise, because was I acknowledge the issue, yeah,

because it's like normalized products at the end, like you have like certain levels that you oversee, yeah? So for example, I experienced that product that was like out of pocket, patient. Were

not counting on that. So I think what you're talking about is basically, you have some process, you're manufacturing something, and something goes wrong, and you know, you don't know exactly what it is, right? I'm not going to necessarily think about access to disruption, because at some level you should expect this, right? Why? Like, I view that as kind of like, sort of risk on the left hand side, right, like you run any manufacturing process, because I'm not familiar with the device you're talking about. But for instance, you know a colleague of mine works very actively in pharma manufacturing, right? And sort of pharma supply chain, more generally, these types of issues are very common, right? Oftentimes it is strict testing. And sometimes, you know, an entire batch is bad, or a sequence of batches, you trace that back to something tangent, somewhere, or something like that, right? But in those processes, yeah, that's terrible. But you you know that this is going to happen. You know, once a year you can expect something off this nature that happens, whatever. Maybe I'm going, you see what I'm saying, political, critical, human error, yeah? So you could have, like, somebody that's something silly, and alcohol factories have fun, right? Or something or something like, yeah, critical human error.

Yeah, third time I tell you the story about this,

for example, in the case of Susana ang, machine broke down, and the medical device cannot be a leader. Wouldn't that be like technical disruption?

So that's 100% of disruption, right? Let me, let me write this, actually, let me write, let me write that, right? So, so a machine goes down, or something like that, right? How is this sort of disruption different from some of these disruptions? Right? That you're absolutely right. They're both disruptions. But what's the difference between kind of the disruption of like a machine going down, and some of the things at the top, good?

Yeah, yeah. So maybe one way of kind of thinking about these things, right? One way about thinking about these things is sort of as follows, right? If you kind of think about this, like, if we did this for a while, you'd have things like execution problems, some supplier performance issues, supply supplies apart, and all of a sudden the part is, like, kind of not dispatch, right? So that damages you. Oh, there's delay at a port or something like that, right? These are all like disruptive things, right? But if you sort of think about these disruptive things, I want to kind of think about them as known unknowns, right? So I don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but I know it's going to happen, right? And when I know this thing is going to happen with some frequency, and as a result, I can kind of hedge for this, and it makes sense to hedge for this, right? Like building a business case to hedge for this sort of risk is not nearly so hard. And in fact, if you sort of think about everything we've talked about in this class so far, right, all of the sort of volatility we've talked about in this class so far falls into kind of that category, right, the known, unknown sort of category. This is volatility. That's just part of doing business, right? I don't expect my business to run like kind of clockwork. I constantly expect these, like little jagged disruptions as we, as we sort of go along, the kind of cost of doing business as we go to the top, though you're sort of thinking about these sort of Black Swan things, right, pandemic, right, right. Like, where's that going to come from? Okay? You know, I'm not going to predict that. Like, suddenly, you know policy is going to change, and you're going to start doing things you've not done for 100 years, right? So these sorts of things are like unknown unknowns, and to a large extent, you can't, you can't really plan for them or control them, right? You can't really capture them with a nice little symbol or something like that, right? Whereas the things at the bottom, I could sort of capture that with a nice little signal. Okay, so really, the sorts of risks we've kind of talked about so far are the sorts of risks over here, right? Like, think of a port delay, right? How does a port delay impact us? A port delay might impact us as a supply shock, right? You know, the stuff was supposed to take a week to get to me. Now it takes two weeks. Okay, we understand this, and we think about this, right? And we carry things like safety stock and so on and so forth to manage that, right? And so we've been kind of managing the stuff at the bottom, stuff at the top, a little bit harder. Okay, now let's just size this. Okay, so I'd like to kind of size what the cost of this sort of risk is, right? Like, so normally, if I kind of think about, you know, what is the cost of this risk, you know, how might you, you know, how might you actually think about, right? So the short of it is, the number is actually pretty big, okay, so this is, like a, this is, these are stats from, like, a big reinsurance stating from Swiss Re, okay. And so broadly speaking, you know, they come up with a good estimate every year. You know, roughly speaking, you know, the estimate this year or last year, really the full year, last year of 2024 right? The economic value of those sorts of risks globally was about three $30 billion $328 billion right? And the interesting thing, by the way, is off the 320 $8,000,000,000.03 18 actually came from natural catastrophes. Okay, so I think about the 328, natural you know, the difference is 10 billion. Excess 10 billion is fine. That's man made, but the rest of it is effectively natural catastrophes. Now, why does the insurance industry Look at this? Because some of this risk is actually insured. Is actually insured. A large part is uninsured, right? So if you look at the second column over here, right, about half of that risk is insured, okay, so basically, if I kind of think about insured losses, right, insured losses are about $146 billion okay, of all of these sort of incur losses on the left, right and off, 146 if you think about what fraction came from natural disasters and things like that, it's 137 so basically, if you sort of think about what drives this risk, right these days, a large part of it is like, just natural disasters, okay, that kind of, you know, kind of throw you for me, right? The first thing that somebody talked about, earthquake or storm, whatever. Okay, so those losses are gigantic. Now, to be clear, there are man made losses, but those man made losses actually pale in comparison. Okay, man made loss is about 10 million, right, relative to the 130 7 billion from natural disaster. Now here's another interesting picture. Okay, I can actually look at the cost of these losses over time, okay, if you look at the cost of these losses over time, okay, and these are sort of, these are insured losses over time, okay? And roughly speaking, this ratio of insured to uninsured has been 50% forever. Okay, so these are what the losses actually look like over time. You know, there's explicitly, like a dashed red line, which is sort of a trend. The trend is like staring in the face, kind of question for you, why? Why? Why are these losses growing over time? Why these losses growing? Sort of, they're sort of this inadvertible, kind of like rise over here. Why is that happening? Sandra, is it because more people actually buying their insurance? No, this is kind of what I said earlier. The rate, the fraction of what's insured versus uninsured, is about 50% okay, so one thing maybe, climate change. Subject, maybe. So why? Maybe one thing is climate change, all right, nine months, maybe

more documentation.

So let me tell you about this number, right? So these are insured losses. So basically, insurance companies have paid out on these things, and what we're seeing is that that payout has increased over time, right? One explanation for this could be more people have high insurance like three samples, and that's actually not the case, because you're also measuring uninsured losses as this happens, right? It continues to be roughly 50%

it's kind of it's kind of it's a little

bit weird. It's a little bit

weird process, because as civilization progresses, more investments are made, therefore the damage, because metal adjusters, is

higher. Oh, okay, so you're saying, like one, one thing may just be inflation or, like, economic growth, right? One of the other economic growth, some combo, right? Some combo thereof, right, good. So by the way, this is not inflation, because these are normalized numbers, okay, everything over here is in 20, $25 okay, but this could be economic growth. Okay, so one thing could be economic growth.

Um,

yeah, the sad, I mean, this would be, that would be nice. The economy has not grown sevenfold. The world economy has not grown sevenfold in this period of time. This is world, yeah, so it's not grown seven fold, but that's nice one, one thing could be, could be, indeed, economic growth. That's probably one decent for sure, because there

is Sean to that point, I would just say, like globalization has more interconnected hurricane or a tsunami, TSMC is going

to have a different proportion Good

Good, good. So basically, if we sort of think about how companies are connected to each other, when I use the word supply chain, it doesn't have to be a physical supply chain, right? This could be an information supply chain, be whatever, right? Things are very, very tied up, right? So there's very, very strong network effects as a result, a risk, risks are no longer localized, right? A risky kind of one corner of the world can dissipate, like, massively, right? Okay, so that could be one thing that's, that's, that's where we're driving, right? Probably a big one. Of technology.

So complexity in goods and services, right? So if I think about goods and services today, how we assemble them, right? They're typically not composed of something super simple, right? You need tons of different things to provide you with, you know, service, good, whatever it is, and you need all those things to provide that for you. So one of those things goes wrong, you're kind of screwed. So there's kind of two things going on here, right? But one is, I like, I like the way you guys have put this right, because you were saying, on the one hand, if I think about the products we're building, if I think about the services we're selling, these are becoming much more complex offers over time. That's the nature of things, right? Like As consumers, we demand better things. These things get more complex. As they get more complex, by their very nature, right, become riskier products and services to provide, right? And one thing goes wrong, to hold things off the shelf, to kind of make matters even worse, right? You know, supply chains are very low. So not only is the thing complex, you're now exposed to risks in many, many different parts of the world that actually impact so you get these two things together, and that kind of is contributing, in probably a pretty big way, you know, this sort of rise, right? So there's sort of, and we said this so, you know, increasing economic activity environment, but then we got all this stuff, right? Supply chains are global, and to make matters worse, by the way, right? Like, we've become efficient, but let's, let's think about that, right? Like, so this entire class has been at some level, about efficiency, right? You only kind of put something together when you need it, you know, like all that sort of stuff, right? As soon as you have one of these disruptions that goes, you know, that hurts you, right? So, so there's a big increase over time. Joke, you

want to add something just

arguably, I'm not

sure if it's the case for this instance, but you would just say

that people are paying more attention to these instances, or things like that. We share apart increasing in

frequency. Got it. Got it. Yeah. So this was kind of the point from earlier, right, where we sort of talked about like Sandra, I think, right? And what we said was that can't really be the case, because what we're talking about is paid out like insurance, and the fraction of insurance has paid out uninsured losses. Okay? Because both those numbers are actually important otherwise, otherwise you see one number going up and the other number. Not

good. All right.

So here's one. Let's do this. Let's start with talking about, like, the thing that I asked you to read, Nokia and Ericsson. You guys read that. Okay? And by the way, it's very hard to find, like, case discussions of this sort of stuff, because nobody likes to talk about right? So, like, I found this discussion in Nokia and Ericsson. That's like, vintage, right? Like, I couldn't believe myself, right, right? Like, the best public discussion I can find is, like, 20 years old, but it kind of captures, like, you know, a few important things. So as you sort of think about Nokia and Ericsson, what are the differences, right? Like, tell me about you, tell me about the key differences between the two, right? Why did one survive? Why did the other not survive? Like, let's, let's kind of go through that, like, level set. From there, both the show tops have their

hands. I'll go again.

So I think Nokia was pretty fast in reacting to the disasters, and they sort of redesigned

the supply chain. Was slow in reacting

to that supply chain disaster. Okay, so it's clear that Nokia reacted fast. Okay, that's that's clear. Okay, good. How do they I mean, why did Ericsson not react fast? I guess, right, like this raises the question of why chain so that's

why they respond.

Okay, so you're saying maybe, look, he actually appreciated the importance of a disruption, right? Because it's a crucial chip that goes into the phone. It's not like some kind of side thing, right? There's no phone without the chip or the brains of the phone. So feels like hard to imagine that Erickson did not realize that, like, the brains of their phone are important to making their phone right. You see what I'm saying, Michael was there a component

of kind of communication breakdown. They weren't efficiently responding

in time. So, like, he was more reactive

to Yeah,

what? What was Erickson's response? If you guys remember what happened at Ericsson, yeah, who got the information? At Ericsson? Who got the information? It's some low level tech, right? So some low level tech actually fielded the information from Philip, right? And what did that tech do? Nothing? Right? The tech did absolutely nothing. And then Nokia, I'm sorry, Phyllis contacted them later, saying, Hey guys, you know, this is actually a pretty significant issue. Blah, blah, obviously, that's that bring high what was what happened at Nokia, in contrast,

Daniel fast communication, because we have experienced something before, so we got prepared,

yeah, so they actually communicated very quickly, right? Like, like, the highest levels of the company knew about this, like, basically the same thing, right? So one issue that we're saying is, like, just, they're just awareness sensing, right? So the organization and Nokia was kind of aware of what happened, you know, at Ericsson, they simply ignored. Okay, good. So that's kind of okay. So they're somewhat reactive. They sense this quickly. What else Alexey

business for Ericsson was, was better in network sales. Like different divisions here,

different divisions here,

different strategic focuses. Was working

for Colombia. I see it was known as the main part of but they were both market leaders in the space at the time, not like one was tiny, the other was gigantic, right? They're both market leaders at the time,

okay, was kind of prepared for this kind of stuff. So apart from the communication flow, they've got conditions. So they've got the cup suppliers. Yeah, they call just straight away, yeah, when Ericsson was about to move to make all this product access. Supply of the chips was out of the market,

yeah. So what was Nokia's move, right? So Nokia basically said, Hey, this could be a big deal, right? And the first thing they did, what were some of the first things they did, one they were actually walk me through what they did First, with respect to Philips Arjun, well, they calculated

exactly how much of an impact exactly how

much of an impact, okay,

basically what their options were. Yeah, determine the options, right? So, yeah. So what did

they do with respect to Phillips? What did they ask for this?

Go ahead. Do it

okay. So one is, like, they found alternative suppliers, right? What they asked?

Yeah, they did more than that, actually, right? They said, Philips, when you get all this stuff up, we're going to power all your all your capacity. And Eric, so that's the thing about what Nokia did, right? So what Nokia did is they got on it very quickly. I think we all see this, right? Having gone on it quickly, they went and they found alternative suppliers, right? And they got it back. And with respect to Philips, they went and they put pressure on Phillips, and they secured, like limited supply from Phillips, right? And say, Hey, you have to give us a commitment that's going to do A, B and C, right? And as a result, when things came back up, you know, they weren't impacted Ericsson, actually was. They said that being pretty bad for Ericsson, by the way. You know, I don't think, I don't recall if the case discusses this, but the center have been pretty bad for Ericsson. Erickson, had a product launch coming up, delaying their product launch, that this whole market was kind of very hot at the time, right? They really lost out as sort of a result of this, and kind of it kind of hurt them. I kind of hurt them pretty badly. Let me ask you guys this. What did

you know? What did Nokia is, you

know, Nokia clearly reacted to this better than Eric said. What did this cost Nokia? Right like, what was right? Like, what did you know? What were Nokia's investments to be able to pull something like this off?

What do we what do we think?

Yeah, it's just a math risk management deal that handles this analysis one year. It's

just a web I'm sorry, the risk

management team in the supply chain department, okay, like you have a team that evaluates all the risk, creates a business case for each one of these activities and sets potential strategy for potential disasters.

I feel like that's a little hard to talk about, right? Because if you sort of think about this, it's, as we just talked about, there's so many things that can happen, little bit difficult to imagine that you have a risk management department that's gaming out all these things, right? These things are hard to game up at some level, yeah,

but at least you have some in many supply chains that I have been Yeah, few of them have the even top the department level. So, so I mean, this is a huge difference in terms of the maturity of the supply chain of those companies.

Okay, so I think having a risk management department is an indicator that they're very sophisticated and thinking about these issues. But what I'm trying to point out is that just simply having that risk management department doesn't quite explain what sort of happened over here, right? Because it's not, it's not like this is something that had been gamed out, right? You can't game out like a random fire, right? There's more than that. I'm saying that's part of it, but it has to be more than that, right? Yeah, let's

see. Maybe it's like a design of their company structure, the part

of it is probably just culture, correct. There's sort of a cultural thing over here where you wanted to, kind of like, escalate these things kind of quickly, get things across quickly, and so forth. Great, that's another big thing. Okay, neither of these things are really significant investments, though. You sort of think about it, it's work, by the way. It's a lot of work to establish that culture. It's not dollars. You don't have to put dollars necessary. Maybe if you want the risk management department, there's some dollars. But again, it's small,

but I was thinking usually, what most of the risk would be associated to suppliers. So you create a collaboration plans with the suppliers to distribute from different places and mitigate this potential risk. In terms of suppliers, usually,

that might actually be a cost, right? So I like where next door is going. So the culture stuff, very, very important, right? Like, I want you to recognize that, right? Like, it's, I know, in like, a classroom, this might come across as, like, kind of like, okay, they talked about it. They did not talk but it's a significant difference, right? Like, like, basically building a culture where, so maybe a story will help you. So, right, so I know this guy named Jamie donin. Jamie, Jamie is an MIT grad from 93 okay. And Jamie, towards the end of his career, was managing all of the Toyota manufacturing in the US. So basically, he ran all famous actors in years. That's a pretty big one, and pretty significant actually, for him, because, and he's sort of, like, culturally, it's a big deal. This is sort of the first non Japanese guy who actually had sort of a job like this. And I spent hours talking to Jamie about, like, you know, how do you think about quality? How do you think about, you know, this sort of stuff, right? And it all in his mind. It all boils down to culture, right? And it's a culture of, like, no detail being too small, right? No detail is too small. As soon as you kind of have that culture of, like, no detail being too small, you kind of, like, a lot of things kind of flow from this. And so at some level, I feel like there's a huge cultural difference in this particular story between Nokia and Ericsson. You can't turn on a diamond and suddenly, you know, say, oh, I want this culture right? Like it's something you actually have to develop, you know, over time. And you kind of like it's almost like a almost cultish in a way, right? Like you have to, you have to want to drink the Kool Aid. And kind of really, you know, really, kind of get, get into this, like, Jamie, when you're talking about this, we give you, like, 19 analogies for playing golf, this, to that, all kinds of crazy stuff, right? Like, this kind of school of like this, this sort of culture like no detail is too small, right? Like, in fact, actually, Jamie's philosophy to magic risk is a little bit different from my own right. Like his view is that, like, you should almost never have a buffer of anything, which sounds insane, right? But what is his philosophy over there, not having a buffer? His philosophy over there, not never having a buffer of anything. Is essentially saying, Listen, if you need the buffer, it means something went wrong. And I don't want to hide that something went wrong. I will kind of see what that thing was, so I can get rid of it, right? And there's this, like, really nice analogy that he talks about, you know, kind of imagining a ship going through a canal, right? So, if you imagine a ship going to canal, the stones at the bottom of the canal, you have plenty of water in the canal, the ship will never hit the stones. Right? On the other hand, if the water level starts getting really low, think of the water level as a buffer. You might actually get the stones. And his whole point is, want to find those stones, get rid of them, and not keep the stones. And okay, and so this is a lot of words, and it's quite fookier, right? But, but there's a huge cultural investment, all right? So that's that's kind of on the soft side, but it's extremely important on the hard side, the next door's point, the ability to be able to go to another supplier, somewhere else, and grab the same product, right? What do you think is goes behind that? Right? Like, what, what's needed to make something like that possible? Right? They did this, right? Like, you guys told me, this is one of the things they did. What's needed to make something like that possible? Yeah, absolutely. So this goes into kind of thinking about the product itself, right? So at some level, you're designing a product. As you design the product, you're kind of thinking about, okay, like, what if I don't have this chip, right? And that probably costs money, right? So building a product that suddenly can, kind of like, work with multiple things, right? That cost money, establishing relationships with multiple suppliers. All of that cost money, right? The thing I started this conversation with, like Nike spending like $4 billion off, right? Why it's establishing multiple suppliers, it really costs money, right? So these things are actually expensive, but then, but the price itself does not suffice, right? Like the cultural piece is actually equally important, and I don't want to sort of give that sort of short trip, right? We're not really talking about it at length, but I don't want to give that short trip. Now, with all that being said, here's kind of a review, except 25 and this is from Gartner, and it's, you know, how much do folks care about the sort of risk we're talking about? And you can read this chart, but the short of it is, they don't, okay, right? Like, so, so light blue and blue is basically, I don't care, right? And so what you can see is, like, across sectors, yeah, high tech, I think just because of how globalized that supply chain has historically written they kind of care the most. But even there, right? 70% of people, sort of surveyed there, said they don't care. So why do you think this is the case? Right? By the way, this display, how does this play out? This plays out in the following sense, making these investments, anything to do this is reflected by this. So my question is, these risks are so big, why do people hit them?

People tend to think that bad things are going to happen less. They

underestimate the chance of happening. People are generally, like,

more optimistic, I think you're going in the right direction.

So there's these famous two famous guys, Conlon and Tversky, okay, they won Nobel Prizes for characterizing how human beings are irrational in their decision making, right? So you see, you took your econ 101, class, right? And that's all contingent on like people being rational. Lots of people like rash, as it turns out, right? And Conrad and Turkey won Nobel Prizes for kind of like thinking about like, can we? Are we kind of irrational in kind of recognizable ways? Right? One way in which, you know where, quote, unquote, predictably irrationally because the title of the booking is, we are very, very bad at estimating tail risk, right? Human beings suck at estimating Taylor's. You tend to under emphasize tail risk in like all the decisions, right? When it comes to bad when it comes to good things, we overestimate Taylorism. So it's kind of crazy. Okay, so this is built into kind of humanity when it comes to bad tail risks, exactly as Derek put it, we systematically underestimate, okay, so, yeah, these are big tail risks, but we all sort of underestimate. Okay, all right. So, so what should we do? Okay, so, what does one do given this sort of set up, right? So let's take stock of where we are, right. Lots of these, sort of like unknown unknowns, high costs. We know what's needed to do this, right? What's needed is sort of, roughly speaking, an investment in culture, so that you're reactive and so on and so forth. There's also hard investments, right? It's not just a culture thing. And the hard investments are kind of hard to make, right? They're hard to make because, well, we saw that Gartner sort of thing, right? And we just said, like, you know, we're terrible at kind of estimating tail risks. So how should we sort of think about this? So when they kind of created this session, I kind of did, like a bit of a literature review. I found, like, a lot of these kind of grand frameworks. So you can buy a bunch of books and a bunch of frameworks, you know, that I've listed over here. But you know, my reaction to all this is this, right? Which is, you can kind of plan all you want, but you know, when shit hits the fan, right? Mike Tyson kind of said it fast, right? If you've not seen this, you're seeing it, okay. So, okay, so given Mike Tyson's view of the world, right, how should we sort of think about this, right? And so, as I said at the start, I want to kind of talk about the three things. And really, I want to talk about one thing, okay, just to kind of say, like, listen, there's so many moving parts here, but what can we do? What can we do in solid, sort of a solid, reasonable, okay, so what I want to focus on is sort of saying, listen, everything is so uncertain, right? So talking about risk is very hard. It's all unknown, unknown. So if we're talking about these sorts of risks, how can we even kind of figure out where that risk is? So what I mean by this? Okay, so let's say, let's make this real. Okay, so let's make this real. Let's say you're talking about like a supply like a truly global supply chain, like a car company, like automotive tends to have one of the most complicated supply chains out right? So you go to a car company like Ford, right? Ford probably has a supply chain that has, like, four tiers. If you get to the bottom tier, there's hundreds of 1000s of supplies, right? These are truly sort of massive supply chains, right? You don't even have visibility over the whole supply chain, okay, so if you're sort of dealing with one of these massive supply chain. How do you just go, like, what does it mean to kind of invest in resilience, right? The supply chain is so massive, it's like, I didn't even know where to start, right? Like, what do I do? Right? Like, in particular, going to the supply chain and say, Oh, for every supplier, I'm gonna have a backup supplier. That's like, a non starter, right? You can't, you can't even do that kind of stuff. Okay? So to my mind, sort of first order thing is to be able to look at a massive supply chain and sort of say, Listen, I don't have the money to like, I'm running a business, right? Like, yeah, I care about this is important, but I also have to write math. So I have limited resources. Given my limited resources, where should I pay attention? Where should I invest in having multiple suppliers and whatever it is like next door was talking about, where should I invest in thinking about product design that's flexible so that, you know, if I don't have like a part, I can make up for it with another part or whatever. Okay, and all this is very expensive, so I can't do it everywhere. So how do I prioritize? How do I kind of find those forms? Okay? And so my game plan is to kind of talk about a very simple framework. To do this. The framework is actually very nicely constant, as it turns out, if we, if we have time, I'll talk about how to actually, literally run the framework, right? There's some opposition involved in it. The next time I'll do that right, the optimization is not, not as important as the framework itself. And then what I want to show you is, if you apply the same framework to pre pandemic four, what would it tell make sense? Okay, so basically, I want to focus on that first piece. And I want to say, Listen, I want to come up with a win of talking about risk in this setting where right, like we're talking about, like storms and earthquakes and whatever, I clearly can't have a sigma, right? So how do I actually talk about risk here? When talking about risk in a certain way, I want to sort of look at a supply chain and say, given this is how I'm talking about risk, where is that risk in the supply chain? How do I find right? And then, having done that, I want to take the same thing applied before, pre pandemic, and say, If you applied this before, what would it say about where risk is? It make sense. That's all I wanted. Okay, Michael, you had a question. Okay, great. Okay, so, so, as I said, I want to talk about Ford, I already said in a very complicated, you know, very complicated supply chain, 10 tiers of suppliers. Just at the first tier. These are called, like, tier one suppliers, right? There's about 1400 of these suppliers, right? So it's just a massive kind of supply chain. So let me ask you this, if you're looking at one of these supply chains. How should you measure risk in the first place? How should we measure what units would you want to use to measure risk?

Daniel dollars, always the right

answer. I'll use dollars. Okay, good. But now tell me more. So dollars, and what sense? Why is it dollars? What? What dollars? Good? I like it. So, what is impacting, how much?

Right, in terms of sales or something, right? So at some level, the way I want to kind of talk about risk is to sort of think about it in terms of impact, or potential impact. Okay, so I want to think about risk in terms of potential impact. I'll call that Fiat. Let's think about risk in terms of potential impact. And what is potential impact. Potential impact is lost sips, lost revenue, right? That's the main thing I know. Now, by the way, you know this is this can also be made more complicated, right? You can sort of say it's not just about immediate lost revenue, you know what? About LCD and this and all these other things. You can make it much richer. But let's try to keep it simple, right? Because we need this calculation to be robust. And that's the thing about, you know, risk, measuring risk in terms of potential impact, potential impact in turn, is measured in dollars, right? Where do those dollars come from? You just lost it, okay? That's, that's what, that's the numeraire. That's how I wanted to talk about,

yeah, I just want to comment, sure. And

so that's how, 100% this,

by the way, interestingly enough, you know, since you're talking about finances, you don't have a finance class, but if you kind of think about the concept like value, risk and so on and so forth, these also suck at capturing bills, right? So if you sort of think about like, one of many things led to the crisis in 2008 but by the way, one of the things that led to the crisis in 2008 was also underestimation of failures, except there it was done at mechanized scale, right? So it was systematically undervalued, and it resulted in all kinds of patterns, right? But nonetheless, my point is, you can have all these universe it's good trying to understand how we're talking about risk. Now, the question is, like, quantify, right when we think about this, this concept of value and risk, what's a robust way of kind of talking about this impact of,

okay, do you also add to that? What are the chances that it will happen? Or because

this is a good degree, good, good. I like this. So a very natural next question to ask is to say, can I put probabilities

Right? Very, very natural, unless it's right, unless we talk about the catastrophes in this thing, I

cannot hide right. Like, how, like, just about it right. Like, a lot of these things we're talking about are, like, they might never happen in your lifetime, right? Like, I think about, like, quantifying the likelihood of risk due to pandemic, right? Not gonna happen. Like, how are we gonna figure that out? Right? Really, not hard to figure out. So you're immediately pointing out an issue we're talking about risk here, which is, it's very hard to put probabilities on this. This is a stark contrast with what we've talked about so far, right? Like the risks we talked about so far, we've been able to put one like probabilities on all these things, but now we talk about risks where we can't put probabilities, right? So how should we think about okay, so I want to sort of think about this in a pretty simple way. Okay, essentially, here's what I'd like to do conceptually. Okay, this very, very simple concept. So imagine this picture. Okay, where on this axis, on the y axis, okay, I'm going to measure potential impact di in dollars, right? So, and as we just discussed, right? We think about this potential impact in dollars as like, this is my lost revenue, you know, because of this risk, or whatever it is, okay, what I want to kind of do on the x axis, okay, is ask the following question. I want to focus on, like, one piece of the chain, of the supply chain. So my supply chain could be this big mess, right? 1000s of players in the supply chain. So what I like to do is be able to pick up a player and ask myself the following question, let's say that that player went down, right? Let's say that player was taken off the board. Okay, so I have this complicated supply chain, and ask myself, look, I have a player over here. Let's say that player was taken off the board. Now, let's say that player was taken off the board for a really short time. What do we expect the impact of vendors to do? So in a supply chain, let's say, like, four.

What do you guys think?

Sure,

yeah, it does depend. Like, I guess what I'm saying is, let's say somebody told you, you know, here's one factory, and that factory has gone down for a date, right? Hopefully it doesn't matter, right? So we're sort of imagining that like, basically, if you're down for a short amount of time, it doesn't matter, right? Why does it not matter if you're down for a short amount of time? Ah, good, right? Somebody said, yes, you're carrying all the safety stock in various parts of the chain, right? You're carrying it for some reason, right? And that's going to kind of help you out. So if the thing is down for a short amount of time, there's hopefully no impact, right? But then, actually, you know, as it's down for longer, what do you think is going to happen? We expect, you expect some impact to actually take place, right? By the way, if it's down for even longer, we expect that slope effect, in fact, actually increase, right? Why? Because, you know, initially, maybe you know you have no impact because you're using safety stock or whatever. Then as you start running out of sources of safety stock, you know, you start seeing some impact. Finally, you're out of all of your safety stock, and you see, like a lot of it, right? And so we're expecting that, if I think about, I'm going to call this time to recovery, okay? TTR, this is that terminology I'm making up. Okay? So if I think about time to recovery, how long for that little node in my supply chain to come back alive? Right? If the time to recovery is small, I'm sort of expecting see if I have a different color here, right? If the time to recovery small, I'm expecting sort of, sort of no impact, right? That's kind of what I'm expecting, if time to recovery is really small, there's really no impact on my supply chain. But as time to recovery picks up, what am I expecting this thing is going to go up, right? We're sort of expecting maybe a curve that looks something like this, right? So our job is going to be the following, okay? We want to actually produce a curve like this for every node in our supply chain. Okay, so I want to look at my entire supply chain go point by point, right? I'm going to go, I'm not going to do this manually, obviously, right? This is where, you know, you can write some optimization and this and that, right? But conceptually, we're going to go node by node, and we're going to produce a picture that looks something like this. Okay, all right, by the way, What assumptions do you need for this picture, for me to produce a picture like this? What assumptions do I need?

Um, I mean,

really, right now I'm just producing this, given the state of my supply chain, sure, so this does not allow me to, like, have multiple nodes go down, right? You can extend this, but the point I make over here is you can do this with making no assumptions, okay, like the challenge that we were talking about a second ago, right? Like probabilities and this, and that I don't need anyone to produce a picture like okay, to produce a picture like this. All I'm sort of saying is, right, how sensitive is my supply chain, my business, my old business, right to disruptions in corners of the business. Okay, now, the term that we're going to kind of talk about over here, right? This is, this is the point until which impact is zero. This, this. This is typically referred to as TTS, our time to survive, okay? So basically, what we're saying is I'm going to go node by node. I'm going to figure out the time to survive for each of these nodes. And I'm also going to actually figure out, hey, what's the impact, right? If the node is down for longer than the time to survive? OK, all right, so if I look at these two quantities, right? Like TTS is a quantity you can determine right for every node in the supply chain. If you wanted to make investments in the supply chain, where would you make investments? Cameron, yeah, so, so nodes where you think that their time to come back up exceed the time to survive, right? So first of all, where you know you believe it's time to recovery is way faster than time to survive. And this is a qualitative judgment, right? Not a quantitative judgment. This is typically going to be qualitative, right? If you think that this thing can come up faster than it's time to survive, probably not really worth that investment. On the other hand, if you looking at an investment and you believe that time to recovery is almost certainly going to exceed time to survive, you need to pay attention to that. Now. There's potentially lots of different nodes where you believe time to recovery is greater than time to survive. How would you prioritize those nodes? Go ahead. Yeah, exactly right. I look at that potential impact picture, and that's how I now. This is a perfect framework. Absolutely not, right. But what's good about this framework? What's good about this framework is you can put these things together while making almost no assumptions about your work, right? You can look at your supply chain as it runs today, right, and say, this is kind of where I'm most vulnerable, right? You can look at every point in your supply chain as it runs today and say, I'm really vulnerable here. I'm really vulnerable that I'm not vulnerable at these other places. Okay, everybody guesses this concept. I want to make it slightly more quantitative, so that the concept goes in, okay,

that's correct, but how do you how do you quantify that without assumptions? I think there's a crisis in Vietnam Good,

good, good, good, good. So I think here's the thing, this picture I can produce without actually saying anything about boy. TTRS, right? You agree with that? Yeah. Good, very good. So where it gets qualitative, okay, is you as a risk manager, as a CEO, typically? Okay, saying, Hey, I know this TTS number for sure, right? So now your qualitative decision is, do you think TTR is going to be to the right of TTS for the left of

TTS if there's like a tsunami and they're closed for six months, or they're destroyed? Yeah, TTR is endless.

I completely agree. There's no, there's no there's no perfect answer to this, right? There's no perfect answer. That's why this is all right. So no perfect answer, but one sort of way of, sort of thinking about it, one like, like patterns that one sees, right? So for instance, if it's something very, very technical, and it's hard to find a substitute, right, that's something where you would imagine TTRS really like, if it goes down, right? Because the sorts of going down that we're talking about in here are like by the major catastrophic, right? So one thing that will sort of help you with figuring out, Hey, don't worry about this or not, is asking yourself, how easy is this for me to substitute yourself? It's very easy to substitute now. You don't have to wait for the factory to come back up. You can say, oh, you know the tsunami there. There's plenty of supply of this stuff. I can go to this other place, by the way, these days, as people sort of look at this stuff, as we're talking the SMP people, the big focus is on, like, a rare minerals, right? So there's a huge focus on rare right? And as a result of those rare minerals, you know, things that depend on those rare, rare minerals, right? So these are all places where you sort of think about the TTR, because it's so hard to find a substitute, right? These are all places where you're, you know, there's active investment in kind of figuring out, how do we build resiliency, right? And that active investment is playing out in terms of new battery technologies that don't need them, you know, new mining complexes, all of this sort of stuff. So the pattern you're looking for, really is, how easy is it going to be for me to substitute out the supply? That's kind of what we'd be looking at. Do

you add to that the question of, well, there's some situations where all my competition, if this happens World School. So it's a market problem. It's not just me.

It's a great question. I think that sounds a good question. That's a fantastic question. So speaking of sneakers, right, like Nike, right? One of the things that got really hurt during the pandemic was home, right? The foam that goes into, like, soaps, right? That really got hit, because it turns out that all the foam in the world, right, like, comes from, you know, basically, okay, so you'd be tempted to sort of say, everybody's screwed, right? It turns out, though, that there were manufacturers that were actually pretty fast, okay? They were pretty nimble, right? Like basically finding alternative sources, and big sneaker manufacturers lost market share as a result of this, right? Because people are able. It's like the Nokia Phillips sort of thing. So I think you could say that it's a slippery slope. It's very dangerous, right? It comes back to alternatives and like, you can't count on, like, having a competitor that's not sneaky enough right, to go and jump on. It's actually that's a different way of thinking about, right? It's a very, very hard as you guys, I'm sure appreciate. It's hard to convey this as an opportunity, right? You're spending like three or $4 million yeah? Oh, you can get back for it, like, measure it next quarter, right? Hard to talk about that. Roi provided very

concrete example, yeah, sure. During

the pandemic, yeah, all of the automakers were struggling to get semiconductor chips, yeah, as part of stellantis, which is a merger of pusho, which is, you know, they have a big branch into Europe. We had a much easier time building relationships with semiconductor suppliers and getting priority. And so if we had to build cars without a specific module, we could catch it up. Yeah, because Ford, which does a tremendous job in many things, but because Ford is an American based, American company, it didn't have the same global relationships. So what they would have to do is stack up these cars and trucks for extremely long periods of time, yeah, where they could get the recovery stock to go, put them in, yeah, and make themselves a vehicle, yeah? So just having a conversation with cams about 24 model year for pickup trucks, and just started flooding the markets at a huge discount, which seems like an incredible deal. Caveat to that is those trucks have been sitting waiting for a module. Yes, all those modules and that backup stock just started coming in, so they're able to pop them in and go put them out. So all of those 24 model year pickup trucks they're selling at, what is it? A 1510, $15,000 Yeah, they're losing. They lost

all of those because they're missing a pocket of me. So I want to actually come back to exactly the story a quick second. Okay, but here's what I'd like to do. Okay, let me I just want to drill in this concept, right? Like I want to make sure this concept sticks, because it's something we can use without, kind of being, you know, without making up stuff, right? I can literally, like, produce a picture like this, without assumptions. And so I just want to make sure this concept sticks. Now come back to Ford, and then we quit, okay, um, so just to kind of make this concept stick right, here's like a toy supply chain, right? So here's my toy supply chain. I'm going to build up a toy supply chain, right? And here's my toy supply chain. I sell three products on the right, okay, product one, product two, product three, and I produce three components I get. I buy components, a red component and a green component from three suppliers on the left, okay, supplier A, B and C, okay. And so supply a supplies green components to products for products one and three. Supplier B sells red components for products one and two, and supply C actually can produce both red and green components, okay, and it sells these red components for the use in product two and the green component for use in product three. If I look at the products themselves, product one requires both a red and a green component. Product two requires just the right component. Product three requires just the green component. Okay, so it's my supply chain questions about the structure of this supply chain. It might be just this, like simple clinical kind of example. Okay, so let's add like, a little bit of detail to the supply chain. Okay, so first is, let's think about the capacity to produce in a week, all right? And so a can produce, you know, 250 green parts a week B can produce 200 red parts. A week C can produce 150 red parts and 100 greedy parts. Okay, so that's what they're capable of producing in one week. And let's assume, by the way, that they hold on to one week of safety stock. Okay, so this is what they can produce in a week, and because, you know, they're running a legit, proper supply chain, they hold on to one week of supply as safety stock. Okay, so that's, that's kind of the supply on the right hand side. Everybody doing that. Now, on the right hand side, I have demand, okay, and so in particular, you know, for product one, I have 150 units demanded per week, valued at $3 for product two, I have 200 units demanded per week, value, I get $1 for it. For product, three, 200 units a week, I can sell, I get $1 Okay, so this is kind of the demand side of the picture. Okay, so that's demand. That's how much you know, that's my margin on each of these products, right? Everybody good with this good so now let's kind of figure out how the supply chain runs today. Okay, let's figure out how the supply chain runs today. So today, the way the supply chain runs is a right produces 250 green parts. It sends 150 green parts for product one, and it sends 100 green parts for product three. Okay, so that whole supply of 250 is split up into 150 150 going to product 150 going to product, 100 going to product, right? Um, B produces 200 parts. It sends 150 to product one and 50 and 50 to product two. Okay, right. So 100 that 200 gets split 150 50. And finally, C produces 150 of the red parts, 100 of the green parts it sells, sends all 100 of the red parts to two and the 100 green parts to three. Okay, making sense so far. So as we, by the way, look at this picture our demand. And, you know, does this picture work, right? Can we actually satisfy all our demand? Right? Yeah, we can right, like that. Demand for the first guy is 150 units a week, and I'm getting 150 green parts, 150 red parts. For the second product, demand is 200 a week. I'm getting 50 red parts from B, 150 red parts from c1. 50 plus 50 is 200 so I'm getting enough. And same story with product three, I need 200 green parts. I get 100 100 of them from a and 100 of them, right? So everybody's gonna do this, okay, so now here's my question to you, okay, let's say that, for whatever reason, supply of C goes down. Okay, let's say supplier C goes down, right? What I would like to understand okay, is what does that picture look like with respect to supplier C, right? And let's think about this qualitatively for a second, and then I want you guys to kind of think about it yourselves for a couple minutes. Okay, so if I sort of think about this qualitatively for a second. If supply of C goes down two runs, your two is not going to get their shipment of 150 units, and three is not going to get their shipment of 100 units of the green point, right? So two needs more of the red stuff, right? We're going to get more of that red stuff from from B, right? Why? Because B is and B is sitting on some safety stock, right. Similarly, you know, let's hear right, like three was expecting 100 units of like green. Green powers right, it can't get the green component. So where would three get its green components from an A sitting on some safety stock as well. Okay, so we're hoping that initially nothing happens, but then stuff will eventually happen, because we'll run out of safety stock, right? So spend two minutes, okay, talking to your friends to figure out what this picture looks like for node C, okay, I think we understand what the picture is, right? But just just to kind of get it down, spend two minutes with your friends, and let's come up with that. And let's come up with That

picture for note C, see

Angie watching.

It? Should I leave a 50? Should I leave Yeah, okay, can I listen to this answer? Would you be willing to share my feedback I received? I want to learn my strengths and weakness. Thank you very much.

You okay,

go ahead. I would say, first I would consider, how long is it down for supply of C

well, we want to sort of evaluate it for arbitrary amounts of time, right? So we say, well, it's down for a short amount of time. What happens longer? How? Right? So I might produce this full curve. And this curve is kind of how long it's down for. And this is sort of impact. And what we want to do is produce that go ahead,

so we assume that C has the

safety. No, that's gone. That's completely gone. C is completely off the table.

Yeah. And then,

for first, if we have DNA, we can use their safety stock. Good. The constraints probably be because we need 150 we also from C Yes,

good. So basically, we've kind of lost this 150 is what you're talking about, right? And you're saying, you know, get get that from this safety stock, right? And so if I got that from this safety stock, there's 200 units of that safety stock here. I'm going to send 150 per week. I'm going to run out of this in 200 divided by 150 1.33 weeks, right? What happens after the 1.33 weeks, you can, but you're not going to be able to produce all of it. Yes, all right, right. I'll still get this right, but you're going to lose this. So I'm going to lose so. So basically, we're saying after, and I'll clean this up right after 1.33 weeks, we lose 150 units of demand, right? Make sense, good. All right, let me what happens next. So B runs out first. What happens later?

He can supply for longer. But that point three,

three. Produce these 50.

Yeah, this is gone, absolutely so. So basically, after week 1.33 you're going to lose demand of product two. I completely agree, right? I'm asking, What about a right so a right now is being used to help us produce product three, right? So if I sort of think about this, I've lost this supply, right? That is gone. Where am I going to get this from? I can get this from a right? And a has 250 units of safety stock, right? So that's going to last, 250 divided by 102.5 weeks, right? And after the 2.5 weeks, what am I going to lose? I'm gonna lose an additional 100, right? We'll lose an additional 100. Okay? After after 2.5 weeks. So basically what we're saying is, I just sort of said that cleanly. This is kind of what we're saying, right in simple English, but you can kind of look at this later, after class, right? Basically, we're saying, listen, B was, this is exactly the idea. You know, initially B makes up for C for product two. It supplies an additional 150 green parts per week. That will last for 1.33 weeks. But after that, you'll lose $150 a week in lost sales, right? And a makes up a C on product three, they're going to supply an additional 100 green parts a week from their safety stock for 250 units of safety stock there, that'll last 2.5 weeks, but after that, you lose $100 a week of last sales. And so what's the picture like over here, right? If I sort of think about this as a picture, basically, we're saying, you know, initially my my potential impact is zero, right? But how long is my potential impact zero, 1.33 weeks. Okay, then I'm gonna have potential impact that goes up, right? What's the slope? How much does potential impact go up by 100 150 over 150 a week, right? Why? Because that's basically this guy over here. This 150 has disappeared. So I'm going to lose 150 units of demand over here, $150 right? So I'm going to kind of at a slope of dollars, 150 per week, right? When does the slope of this line actually increase at 2.5 weeks? Because this is now where A is also done, right? So at 2.5 weeks is kind of also out of inventory, right? And that's going to cost us an additional $100 a week, right? And so this is going to go up even more. That slope is $250 Okay, so this is kind of the conceptual picture, right? But obviously we want to produce this conceptual picture for the entire supply chain, you can do this by doing some linear optimization, right? I want to do that with you, right? I can share it with you, if

you don't just think here, right? So this is okay,

and I can produce this picture for every node in a supply chain. Now let's say I went and I did this at four, okay, let's say I did this at four. Okay, sorry. Everybody understand the picture, right? They're basically saying, as an impact of time to recovery, what's your kind of potential as a function of time to recovery? What's your potential impact, right? So now let's say I did this at four. To do this at four, okay? And we sort of did this across a host of tier one suppliers, okay? And we put them into basically six categories, all right. Now vast majority, there's basically no impact. Why? Because these are products where you can easily find substitutes and so on so forth, right? And then there was kind of a small group where the impact was actually quite high, okay, so let's look at this more. Okay, so basically, if I look at all my notes, right, there's like four or 5000 tier one suppliers, right? And I kind of looked at them on the following chart. Okay, so what I'm doing over here is I'm talking about potential impact, all right? And how are we thinking about potential impact? We're thinking about potential impact as a function of time to recovery, exceeding the time to survive. Okay, so producing potential impact on the x axis and then the y axis, by the way, what I'm producing is, how much are you spending on that supply? Okay, alright, by the way, who do you think we're spending a lot of money on? What are the sorts of things you're spending a lot of money on? Yeah, Archer, the high

risk ones are, again, semiconductors and modular suppliers

that are I'm saying, Who are we spending a lot of money? Like, we're spending lots of dollars, right? Like, my cost of revenue for this stuff is very high. Supplies with what? Yeah, yes, of course, yeah. So,

like the engine and like the road steel and this and that and all this other stuff, right? Where do you think that stuff is? That stuff's all on the left, right? That's high spend for supply. What's kind of strange about this picture?

Yeah, people were spending the least on have the ability to have biggest impact.

Yeah, right. So you look at this, basically the people that like, if I look at the guys over here, we're not spending a whole bunch of money on the people that have very high potential impact on our supply chain. We're not spending a whole bunch of cash on right, but thanks to kind of doing this, we know that these are people with high potential impact, despite the fact that they're not people that we spend a lot of money. Now, let me ask you this, if you kind of look at one of these supply chains, like, intuitively, who do you think are the expensive players in the supply chain? Oh, the people you spend a lot of money on, right? You're saying semiconductor. Semiconductors because you know this, but it's going to be intuitively, the people you spend a lot of money on as not semiconductor for automakers, right? The cost of a car that goes into semis is 2% 2% of the landed cost of a car goes into semiconductors. It's like nothing, right? So are you paying attention to chips? Of course not. It's like worthlessly, right? And it turns out all those people over there, they're all chips, right? And this picture was produced in 2015 right? With data from 2015 so the power of this is what right? The power of this is saying, Listen, I can be completely objective about producing a picture of right? There's no There's no subjectivity in this picture. I can be completely objective about producing this picture. What this picture is going to tell you about is it's going to value suppliers based on risk, how much impact they actually have on their supply chain, as opposed to, let's say, how much you're spending on what does this do in the case of Ford? What this does in the case of Ford is it points you to parts of the supply chain, right? Well, you would normally think there's a lot of risk, but turns out there is a lot. Okay, you can similarly, sort of take this thing, apply it pretty much any setting, right? For folks, I think very hard to do exactly that do this, you need to start with mapping out your supply chain carefully, so on and so forth. And people these days are spending tons of money to produce exactly these sorts of pictures, right so they proactively know web and rich flies. Now, what do you do once you've discovered Okay, I want to wrap actually, if you don't mind, right? So what do you want? What do you want to do after you discover this, yeah, find

the alternative

suppliers. Like increase the time.

So one is find alternative suppliers. What else can you? Alexei, yeah, but maybe vertically integrate or buy a lot of this stuff, right? Right? By the way, for these guys was even trickier, right? Because they're not spending a lot on the chips, and the chip manufacturers don't view these guys as important customers. So it's like doubly bad, you see, you see what I'm saying, right? So it's a very, very tricky situation, right? As things stand, what else would we

do today? Change the product design so that the dependency is reduced,

change product design, right? So, hey, I can take an ARM chip, or I can take a chip from Intel. I can take a chip from Yeah, so it cost me a little bit more in terms of design. It's totally worth it, right? Like, given, given this sort of flexibility, okay, so what have we sort of talked about, all right, just to kind of wrap, right? And this is basically all what you just talked about putting in pictures, right? So what do we talk about? Really? We talked about one thing, all right? And this is kind of the most important thing we can kind of talk about quantity. All the other stuff really is going to come from your intuition, your knowledge of the supply chain, right? And so what we basically talk about is kind of proactively trying to figure out where this lies, right. We basically focus on two things. We focus on, how do we measure? How do we talk about, you need to talk about risk in terms of the impact it actually has on your business, right? But then, as you sort of talk about that, the challenge is very difficult for me to put probabilities on things and that kind of stuff, right? So how do I try to quantify that risk when I know it's going to be impossible for me to come up with the probability of a pandemic or something like that? So what we talked about is a framework that lets us do just that, right? It's the sort of thing with understanding impact as a function of time to recovery, right? And what we saw is, if we applied this framework in the context of, let's say, a massive supply chain, like for right, it would literally point to things that actually matter, places where, funnily enough, you're not spending a lot on the suppliers, but they have significant, disproportionate impact on your business. Okay, so that's it for today. I wanted to talk about the feedback. I guess we'll talk about it tomorrow, because, I mean, I've I do have a lot to talk about over there but let's wrap for today and let's start tomorrow. We'll talk about freedom.
