1. problem definition  
Collective learning platform between and among scholars and entrepreneurs

2. problem to solve:  
In operations for entrepreneurship, two desires that can be need-solution pairs are not matched. First is scholar’s desire to teach and experiment their theories. Second is entrepreneurs’ need for consulting to craft strategy and tactics and execution plans throughout their journey from nailing to scaling to sailing.To be specific, scholars wish to have easy-to-use place to get feedback on their theories where they post both informal thoughts/brainstorms as well as more polished essays, plus links to research. Entrepreneurs however, are in constant need of research and data/accumulated wisdom that can help them address many challenges. However that information is very scattered and does not come in the form of advice customized to the challenges faced by particular individuals/teams.

3. how AI can help?  
- by aggregating an appropriate market/readership and continually searches the web for relevant links to each post (AI as student and simulation from Mollick & Mollick)  
- create bot that digests an individual entrepreneur’s challenges and walks him/her along with solid advice at each step of the way (AI as mentor and tutor from Mollick & Mollick)

4. means of delivering vision  
- simulated interaction: [https://chat.openai.com/share/80399298-29cd-4f71-b822-f7270e59aa87](https://chat.openai.com/share/80399298-29cd-4f71-b822-f7270e59aa87)

5. todo/wish feedback  
- what modality (text, code, image, audio, 3d, video) would be effective for the above?

- classify datasets into four types: pooling the compass 
- does case studies have format?
- what should be the reward function? (finding similar cases (scale, sector) and simulate though their experiences; flight simulator)

- do you have access to https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies? trying to learn structures of the document e.g. https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/copycats-clones-fast-followers-note-replicating-business-models
