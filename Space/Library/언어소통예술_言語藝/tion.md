In evaluating whether a paper makes a theoretical contribution, the core question is not whether the idea is novel or well-executed, but whether it changes how a specific audience thinks. The value of a scholarly contribution lies not in the ideas themselves, but in what they do for readers. This perspective, that writing is about readers, not writers, places the audience at the center of the contribution equation. All three elements of contribution—interestingness, importance, and face validity—are defined relative to a specific scholarly audience.

This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating and developing theoretical contributions, particularly in contexts where the goal is to challenge assumptions and shift understanding within a scholarly audience. It emphasizes the interdependence of surprise, consequence, and plausibility—anchored in the beliefs and expectations of a defined readership.

I think of it as the contribution triangle. The key elements of the triangle are articulated below.

Audience: The Anchor of All Contribution

Before any idea can be said to make a contribution, it must be clear to whom it contributes. A paper must identify its audience and demonstrate familiarity with that audience’s assumptions, expectations, and theoretical conversations. Contribution is inherently relational—it is not a property of the idea alone, but of the idea’s effect on a community of thought. Thus, authors must ask: What does my audience currently believe? And what would it take to change that belief?

Identifying your audience means asking: What community are you speaking to? What do they believe or assume about the phenomenon you’re studying? What literatures do they rely on, and what would surprise them? A contribution is never general; it is always relative to an audience. The same idea may be boring to one audience and paradigm-shifting to another.

The contribution triangle—Interesting, Important, Valid—only takes on meaning once the audience is specified. What surprises one community may be obvious to another. What one field sees as trivial, another may view as a foundational challenge. Audience is not one leg of the triangle—it is the ground the triangle sits on.

1 Interestingness: Breaking a Null Assumption

Surprise is the operational test of interestingness: if the audience is not surprised, the idea is not interesting.

To frame a contribution as interesting, it must be positioned against a null expectation—something your audience assumes to be true unless shown otherwise. However, many papers fail to specify the null clearly, leaving readers unsure of what is being challenged.

A well-formulated null typically takes the form:

“The audience would expect X to be true, but under certain conditions, we show that Y is actually the case.”

To surface and articulate your null, ask:

● What would my target audience assume to be true in this situation?

● What implicit prediction would existing theory make?

● What prior finding or belief am I inviting the reader to question?

Examples:

● Null: “You thought R&D was done to create new knowledge.”

○ Null Breaking: “In fact, R&D is often done to be learn from others’ existing knowledge”

● Null: “You thought that individuals commit suicide for psychological reasons.”

○ Null Breaking: “In fact, there are conditions under which suicide is driven by social (structural) reasons.”

● Null: “You thought the rise in ADHD diagnosis is due to modern childhood issues (video games, too much sugar, too little outdoor play)” ○ Null Breaking: “In fact, the rise in ADHD might be causes by changing regulatory considerations (standardized school testing)”

A clear null not only creates space for surprise, it also anchors the entire theoretical narrative of the paper.

A paper is interesting when it breaks a null assumption held by the audience. As Murray Davis (1971) argued in his essay 'That’s Interesting!', a paper is interesting when it challenges a belief the audience holds to be true, not simply when it is novel. Interestingness arises from surprise, not novelty. An idea is not interesting because it is new; it is interesting because it violates an expectation. This makes interestingness conditional on what the audience already believes—their orthodoxy. An idea with “interesting potential” becomes a contribution only when it is framed against a specific null. The same idea can be framed as interesting or uninteresting depending on how it is positioned.

This distinction between novelty (newness) and surprise (unexpectedness) is crucial. Surprise requires a prior belief; novelty does not. A finding that LLMs behave like humans in a decision task is only interesting if the audience assumed they would not. If they already expect

2 convergence between human and machine behavior, then the result, however novel, is not surprising—and therefore not interesting.

This is why "gap-spotting" is not enough. Simply identifying something that has not yet been studied does not make a paper interesting. There is an infinite number of things that haven’t been done yet. But most of them probably don’t matter. Many papers fail to contribute because they spot a gap in the literature without problematizing existing assumptions. Gap-spotting answers the question “What’s missing?” Problematization asks, “What might be wrong with what we think we know?” A true contribution challenges what the audience believes. not just what they’ve already covered.

Moreover, not all assumptions are created equal. Drawing from Alvesson and Sandberg (2011), who argued that contributions should be generated by problematizing existing assumptions, we can distinguish between different levels of assumptions. These range from in-house assumptions (least impactful) to root metaphors, paradigmatic, ideological, or field-level assumptions (most impactful). Challenging deeper, broader assumptions is harder, but it is also what often leads to high-impact theories. For example, Williamson’s transaction cost economics challenged the field-wide assumption that markets were frictionless, reshaping how scholars understood the boundaries of the firm.

Framing the right null is itself an act of intellectual search. You are navigating a rugged landscape of possibilities, trying to locate a framing that breaks an assumption your audience did not expect to be broken.

Importance: The Consequence of the Surprise

While surprise is what makes a claim interesting, importance is what makes it matter. A paper must show that its surprising insight has meaningful implications—for theory, for practice, or for how we understand the world. An interesting result becomes a contribution only if it allows the audience to explain something they previously could not, predict something in a new way, or reframe a foundational assumption.

Bartunek et al. (2006), in their work on what makes research interesting, emphasize importance as a criterion, though they do not define it precisely. Importance emerges when a finding changes what an audience is able to do or understand. For instance, a new theory that explains why firms invest in R&D despite high spillovers (because R&D helps absorb others’ knowledge) matters because it alters our interpretation of firm behavior—a theoretical consequence with explanatory and predictive weight.

If a paper is surprising but does not appear to change anything of significance, it tends to be dismissed as merely cute. Reviewers and editors may acknowledge that the paper “made them think,” but without a consequential takeaway, the reaction remains intellectual amusement, not scholarly impact. Cute papers are interesting but not important. Important contributions make the audience ask not just “Really?” but “So what?”

Consider one of the examples from earlier:

● Null: “You thought R&D was done to create new knowledge.”

3 ○ ○

Null Breaking: “In fact, R&D is often done to be learn from others’ existing knowledge” Importance: Explains the well-known empirical anomaly that firms do R&D even in industries with very high spillovers (i.e., their knowledge flows rapidly to rivals).

Face Validity: Credibility and Persuasiveness

Even a surprising and important idea fails as a contribution if it lacks face validity. This is not empirical validity per se, but the plausibility of the logic that connects the null-breaking insight to its implications. Face validity is what allows a skeptical but informed reader to suspend disbelief—to say, “I see how that could be true.”

Face validity is not the same as intuition or familiarity. It is the audience's judgment that the logical steps connecting the surprising claim to its implications are reasonable, even if unproven.

Bartunek et al. (2006) acknowledge the importance of validity in theoretical contributions, although they do not fully articulate what constitutes it. In this framework, validity rests on the theoretical logic that connects the surprise to the implication.

For example, in Cohen and Levinthal (1989), the claim that R&D enables firms to absorb external knowledge is not just asserted but justified by a conceptual logic: learning from spillovers is not costless. Some portion of R&D spending can thus be understood as investment in absorptive capacity. This argument persuaded readers not because it was proven empirically, but because it made sense.

Similarly, Daniel Kahneman’s experiments on loss aversion had face validity not because of statistical significance, but because readers could see themselves choosing $50 for sure over $100 with a 50% probability. The effect was psychologically and intuitively plausible.

Consider one of the examples from earlier:

● Null: “You thought R&D was done to create new knowledge.”

○ Null Breaking: “In fact, R&D is often done to be learn from others’ existing knowledge” ○ Importance: Explains the well-known empirical anomaly that firms do R&D even in industries with very high spillovers (i.e., their knowledge flows rapidly to rivals).

○ Validity: As scholars, we are all aware that when we embark on our research journey, the process of writing papers (akin to R&D) significantly enhances our ability to read and learn from others’ papers.

Diagnosing Contribution: Questions to Ask

To surface audience assumptions, ask: What has been taken for granted in recent literature reviews? What would seem implausible or controversial if stated plainly in a seminar? What would contradict a widely taught framework or canonical model?

4 To apply this framework, scholars can use the following diagnostic prompts to test whether their work meets the standard of contribution:

Audience

● Who is the audience for this paper?

● What does this audience currently believe that I’m asking them to reconsider?

Interestingness

● What is the null expectation I am breaking?

● Would my audience actually be surprised by this result or claim?

● How deep or foundational is the assumption I am challenging?

Importance

● What changes if my audience accepts this finding?

● Does it enable a new explanation, prediction, or theoretical shift?

Face Validity

● Is the logic connecting the surprise to its consequence clear and believable?

● Can an informed, skeptical reader accept this claim as plausible, even if not proven?

Putting It All Together: A Composite Function

While this framework primarily focuses on theoretical contributions, it can also be applied to methodological or empirical work that challenges assumptions about how we generate knowledge, measure constructs, or interpret evidence.

These three elements—interesting, important, and valid—form the vertices of a triangle, anchored in the audience. A strong contribution sits inside that triangle, balancing all three in relation to what the audience believes and values.

We can think of contribution as a function:

Contribution = f(audience | interesting + important + valid + interactions)

Each element is necessary but not always sufficient on its own. There can be compensating variation: a highly surprising and persuasive idea may compensate for modest importance; a profoundly important claim may justify more interpretive flexibility in the logic. These attributes also interact: surprise heightens importance; importance raises the stakes of face validity; face validity enables the uptake of surprise.

For example, a paper that offers a novel insight into why a widely accepted theory fails under certain conditions may seem unimportant at first. But if the logic is airtight and the claim is surprising enough, it may prompt readers to rethink how robust that theory really is. Conversely,

5 a less surprising insight may still matter deeply if it resolves a critical theoretical contradiction or opens a new domain of application.

It is critical to recognize that, as the author, you must choose what content belongs in each vertex of the contribution triangle: interesting, important, and valid. This is not a mechanical task. It is a creative challenge that involves search, evaluation, and judgment. Authors often become prematurely locked into a specific formulation for each corner, limiting the potential impact of the paper. Be deliberate in exploring multiple ways to frame your contribution before settling on a final configuration. Equally important, each vertex must contain distinct content. You cannot assign the same substantive idea to more than one corner. A contribution is only compelling when it offers a unique surprise, a separate reason it matters, and a credible justification for believing it.

This framework also implies that non-contributions can be diagnosed along a spectrum. While offered partly tongue-in-cheek, the following typology encourages scholars to reflect on which dimension their work might be lacking:

● Interesting + Important + Valid = Contribution

● Not Interesting + Important + Valid = Boring (technically sound but fails to capture attention)

● Interesting + Not Important + Valid = Cute (provocative but inconsequential)

● Interesting + Important + Not Valid = Unsubstantiated Insight (compelling idea without credible support)

● Interesting + Not Important + Not Valid = Speculative Fluff (clever but implausible and trivial)

● Not Interesting + Important + Not Valid = Consulting (practically motivated but theoretically weak)

● Not Interesting + Not Important + Valid = Self-Referential Formalism (formally tight but purposeless)

● Not Interesting + Not Important + Not Valid = No Clear Contribution (no meaningful surprise, implication, or persuasive logic)

Ultimately, to make a contribution is to change what an audience believes, and to do so by telling them something they didn’t expect, showing why it matters, and persuading them that it could plausibly be true.

Strengthening a Contribution

To improve a paper’s contribution:

● Reframe your core claim relative to a clear null. Ask: What does your audience believe that you are challenging?

● Make the implications of the surprise explicit. What changes if your result is true?

● Tighten the theoretical logic linking your surprise to its consequence to increase face validity. Crafting a contribution is both an intellectual and rhetorical task: it requires

6 knowing what to challenge, why it matters, and how to convince others that your insight deserves their belief.
