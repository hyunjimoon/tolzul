## The CLEAR Acronym

| Letter | Principle | Question to Ask |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **C** | **Concrete** | Can I replace this abstract noun with a verb? |
| **L** | **Lean** | Does this sentence earn its place? |
| **E** | **Earned** | Is this claim backed by evidence + mechanism? |
| **A** | **Accessible** | Does the first sentence state the paragraph's point? |
| **R** | **Reader-centric** | What does the reader need to know next? |

## Master Scholars & Their Principles

### 📘 Steven Pinker (The Sense of Style)

| Principle | Description | Transform |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Classic Style** | Write as if showing the reader something in the world | "We find that..." → "The data reveal..." |
| **Curse of Knowledge** | Assume reader doesn't know; define terms on first use | Jargon → Plain English + Definition |
| **Kill Nominalization** | Convert noun-forms back to verbs | "investigation of" → "we investigate" |
| **Strong Verbs** | Replace be/have with action verbs | "is suggestive of" → "suggests" |
| **Right-Branching** | Main point first, qualifications after | "X, which Y, suggests Z" → "X suggests Z. Y explains why." |
| **Logical Transitions** | Logic connects, not just words | Remove "However"—does it still flow? |

#### Nominalization Kill List
```
❌ "The investigation of X"      → ✅ "We investigate X"
❌ "The acquisition of resources" → ✅ "Acquiring resources"
❌ "The assumption is that"      → ✅ "We assume"
❌ "There is a tendency to"      → ✅ "X tends to"
❌ "The result was an increase"  → ✅ "X increased"
```

### 📗 Scott Stern (Strategy & Entrepreneurship)

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Causal Precision** | State A→B→C chains explicitly | "Capital reduces flexibility, and flexibility predicts growth" |
| **Boundary Conditions** | Always specify when claims hold | "This relationship holds when..." |
| **Empirical Referent** | Anchor every claim to data | "($\rho = -0.052$, $p < 0.001$)" |
| **Mechanism First** | Explain why before what | Lead with mechanism, follow with finding |

#### Causal Chain Template
```
A causes B.          → "Capital attracts aligned stakeholders."
B causes C.          → "Aligned stakeholders compress belief variance."
C causes D.          → "Compressed variance blocks pivoting."
Therefore, A→D.      → "Therefore, capital blocks pivoting."
```

### 📙 Charles Fine (Operations Management)

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Input→Process→Output** | Frame as systems | "Capital (input) → Commitment (process) → Rigidity (output)" |
| **Clock Speed** | Quantify rates and ratios | "$CR = C_u / (C_u + C_o)$" |
| **Actionable** | Reader knows what to do after reading | 3-step protocol, diagnostic metrics |

#### Systems Thinking Template
```
INPUT:    What goes in?     → Capital, promises, stakeholder expectations
PROCESS:  What transforms?  → Commitment formation, belief alignment
OUTPUT:   What comes out?   → Strategic rigidity or flexibility
FEEDBACK: What loops back?  → Success attracts more capital → more rigidity
```

### 📕 Andrew Gelman (Statistical Rigor)

| Principle | Description | Transform |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Data Speaks** | Let statistics carry weight | "dramatically" → "$2.7\times$" |
| **Single Hedge** | One uncertainty marker per claim | "may potentially suggest" → "suggests" |
| **Earned Claims** | Match claim strength to evidence | "demonstrates" → "is consistent with" |
| **Acknowledge Limits** | State what data cannot show | "We document associations, not causal effects" |

#### Hedging Hierarchy
```
STRONG (use rarely):     "demonstrates", "proves", "establishes"
MODERATE (default):      "suggests", "indicates", "is consistent with"
WEAK (for speculation):  "may", "might", "could"

Rule: Never stack hedges. "may potentially suggest" → "suggests"
```

## Practical Checklists

### ✅ Sentence-Level Checklist

- [ ] Is the main verb an action verb (not is/are/was/were)?
- [ ] Is the subject concrete (not "it" or "there")?
- [ ] Does the sentence start with known information?
- [ ] Is it under 25 words? (If not, split)
- [ ] Remove "the fact that", "in order to", "it is important to note"

### ✅ Paragraph-Level Checklist

- [ ] Does the first sentence state the paragraph's main point?
- [ ] Does each sentence follow logically from the previous?
- [ ] Would removing transition words break the logic? (If yes, fix logic first)
- [ ] Is there exactly one idea per paragraph?
- [ ] Is the paragraph under 150 words?

### ✅ Section-Level Checklist

- [ ] Does the section title preview the content?
- [ ] Do subsection titles form a logical sequence?
- [ ] Is there a clear "They Say → I Say" structure?
- [ ] Are contributions stated explicitly (not implied)?
- [ ] Is "So What" answered?

## Transition Logic (Not Just Words)

### ❌ Bad: Verbal Transition Only
```
Signaling theory suggests precision helps.
However, we find a U-shape.
Therefore, the theory needs modification.
```
→ "However" is doing all the work. WHY is there contrast?

### ✅ Good: Logical Transition
```
Signaling theory suggests precision helps—when investors verify claims.
But not all investors verify. Some project their vision onto abstract promises.
For projection-oriented investors, precision constrains rather than enables.
This heterogeneity explains the U-shape.
```
→ Each sentence sets up the next. Logic creates the transition.

### Test: Remove Transition Words
If removing "However/Therefore/Moreover" breaks comprehension, the logic is weak.
Fix the logic first, then add transition words only if needed.

## Templates for Common Moves

### 🔹 Introducing Prior Literature ("They Say")
```
[Theory] holds that [core claim] (Author, Year).
This prediction assumes [implicit assumption].
We test whether this assumption holds in [context].
```

### 🔹 Stating Your Contribution ("I Say")
```
We identify [X] as a boundary condition for [Theory].
The theory's predictions hold when [condition A].
When [condition B], the opposite applies.
```

### 🔹 Presenting Empirical Findings
```
[Finding stated simply]. 
The magnitude is [statistic]: [interpretation].
This pattern holds across [robustness checks].
```

### 🔹 Handling Objections
```
Some may argue that [objection].
We cannot rule this out with [data type].
However, [mitigating evidence] suggests [response].
Residual limitation: [what would resolve this].
```

### 🔹 Stating Practical Implications
```
For [audience], the implication is [action].
Step 1: [Concrete first step]
Step 2: [Concrete second step]
Step 3: [Concrete third step]
```

## Management Science Style Guide

### Tone
| Avoid | Use |
|-------|-----|
| "We prove" | "Our evidence suggests" |
| "dramatically" | "$2.7\times$" |
| "toxic", "fatal" | "negatively associated" |
| "the murky middle" (repeatedly) | "intermediate positioning" |
| "I" | "We" (even for sole author) |

### Metaphors
- **One primary concept** is acceptable (e.g., "Promise Vendor")
- Multiple competing metaphors feel scattered
- Introduce formally: "a phenomenon we term the 'X'"

### Claims
- Association ≠ Causation (always acknowledge)
- Boundary conditions > Universal claims
- Effect sizes > Adjectives
