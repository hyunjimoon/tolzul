# Inducement Prizes and Innovation

## Summary
Uses novel dataset from Royal Agricultural Society of England (1839-1939) to examine causal effect of innovation prizes. Exploits random variation in which technology areas receive prizes across years. Finds pace and direction of technological change respond to prizes, with prestige more effective than monetary rewards.

## Research Question
Do inducement prizes causally affect innovation rates and direction? What role does prize type (monetary vs prestige) play?

## Key Concepts

### Prize Design
Awards offered for specific technological achievements in agriculture. Variation across years in which areas receive prizes provides identification.

### Types of Awards
**Monetary prizes**: Cash payments for winners
**Prestige awards**: Recognition without financial reward

## Main Results

### Causal Effect on Innovation
Prize offerings increase patenting in targeted technology areas relative to control areas.

### Prestige > Money
Non-monetary prestige awards more effective motivator than pecuniary

 prizes.

### Direction of Innovation
Prizes successfully redirect innovative effort toward targeted problems.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: Prestige is a better motivator than cash for innovators - challenges pure pecuniary incentive models.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Difference-in-differences with random prize assignment
**Data**: RASE awards 1839-1939; patent records by technology class
**Analysis**: Panel regressions exploiting within-class variation in prize availability
