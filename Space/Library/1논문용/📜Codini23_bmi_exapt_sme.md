Although research underlines the need for [SMEs](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/social-sciences/company "Learn more about SMEs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to innovate their Business Model, they [face](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/face "Learn more about face from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") considerable challenges in exploring external business opportunities and experimenting/developing their available resources in unexpected ways. We posit that one way that [SMEs](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/computer-science/small-and-medium-enterprise "Learn more about SMEs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can innovate their Business Model is through [exaptation](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/exaptation "Learn more about exaptation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), a discontinuous evolutionary process that allows utilizing and adapting existing resources in new application domains. Using a [case study](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/computer-science/case-study "Learn more about case study from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") approach, we investigate the case of a SME that has successfully innovated its Business Model through [exaptation](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/exaptation "Learn more about exaptation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We then discuss how three key exaptation processes lead to value creation, delivery and capturing, thus supporting Business Model Innovation in [SMEs](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/topics/social-sciences/company "Learn more about SMEs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
