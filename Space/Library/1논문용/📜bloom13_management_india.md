# Does Management Matter? Evidence from India

## Summary
Landmark **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** on management consulting for Indian textile firms. Shows that adopting **basic management practices** (quality control, inventory management, HR practices) increases productivity by **17%** and profitability. First causal evidence that management practices directly cause productivity differences.

## The Central Question

**Puzzle**: 
- Some firms much more productive than others, even in same industry
- Large productivity gaps persist for decades
- **Why?** Technology? Capital? Labor quality?

**Bloom et al. hypothesis**: 
> **Management practices** explain much of productivity variation

## Research Design

### Setting: Indian Textile Manufacturing
- **Sample**: 28 textile plants near Mumbai
- **Treatment**: Free management consulting (5 months, 1 consultant/week)
- **Control**: 6 plants, no consulting
- **Timeline**: 2008-2010

### Management Intervention

**Practices introduced** (38 total):

#### 1. **Quality Control**
- Defect tracking systems
- Root cause analysis
- Statistical process control
- **Example**: Log fabric defects, trace to cause

#### 2. **Inventory Management**  
- FIFO (first-in-first-out)
- Storage organization
- Stock tracking
- **Example**: Reduce raw material wastage

#### 3. **Production Planning**
- Work scheduling
- Machine maintenance logs
- Downtime tracking
- **Example**: Plan maintenance to minimize disruptions

#### 4. **HR Practices**
- Performance reviews
- Attendance tracking
- Incentive systems
- **Example**: Link pay to individual performance

### Why RCT Is Critical

**Problem with observational studies**:
- Good management ↔ Good firms (reverse causality)
- Omitted variables (firm quality)
- Selection bias

**RCT solution**:
- Random assignment → causal identification
- Treatment vs. control → clean comparison
- Can measure: adoption, productivity, mechanisms

## Key Findings

### 1. **Management Practices Have HUGE Causal Effect**

**Productivity**:
- Quality defects: **-50%**
- Inventory: **-20%**
- Output per worker: **+17%**

**Profitability**:
- Return on capital employed: **+17 percentage points**
- Profits: +$300,000/year average

**Magnitude**: Comparable to investing in new machines!

### 2. **Low Adoption Despite Large Returns**

**Puzzle**: If management practices have 17% ROI, why aren't they adopted?

**Barriers identified**:

#### A. **Information**
- Firms don't know what "good management" is
- No local examples or training
- **Evidence**: Firms surprised by results

#### B. **Organizational Constraints**
- Family ownership → resist professional management
- Difficult to monitor implementation
- Worker pushback on changes

#### C. **Credit Constraints**
- Consulting costs money (even if ROI is high)
- Can't finance working capital for new practices

#### D. **Managerial Time**
- Owner-managers stretched thin
- No bandwidth to implement changes
- **Evidence**: Firms with dedicated managers adopt more

### 3. **Practices Are Complementary**

**Finding**: Adopting practices in **bundles** more effective than piecemeal

**Examples of complementarity**:
- Quality control + inventory management
- HR practices + production planning
- Monitoring + incentives

**Implication**: Can't cherry-pick—need systematic approach

### 4. **Effects Persist**

**Long-run tracking** (3 years post-intervention):
- Most practices maintained
- Productivity gains persist
- Firms adopt additional practices on their own

**Interpretation**: 
- Not just "Hawthorne effect"
- Real organizational learning
- Evidence of organizational capital (à la BHS 2023)

## Critical Insights

> **Why this matters**: First proof that management practices are not just correlated with performance—they CAUSE better performance. Settles decades-old debate about whether "management matters."

### Four Revolutionary Implications

#### 1. **Management Is a Technology**

Like physical technology:
- Can be measured
- Can be taught
- Has large returns
- Diffuses slowly

**Unlike physical technology**:
- Harder to copy (tacit knowledge)
- Requires organizational change
- Context-dependent

#### 2. **Productivity Gaps Are Partly Management Gaps**

**Implication for development economics**:
- Not just capital or education
- **Also**: Organizational capability
- Can improve with training/consulting

**Policy relevance**: 
- Industrial policy should include management training
- Subsidize consulting for small firms
- Diffuse best practices

#### 3. **Why Misallocation Persists**

If management practices have such high returns, why don't they spread?

**Answer**: Multiple frictions
- Information barriers
- Organizational resistance  
- Credit constraints
- Managerial capacity limits

**Not** just "bad managers"—systemic barriers

#### 4. **Micro-Foundations for Aggregate TFP**

**Macro puzzle**: Why is TFP so low in developing countries?

**Micro answer**: Management quality
- India: Average score 2.5 / 5
- US: Average score 3.5 / 5
- **Gap**: Explains ~20% of productivity gap

## Methodology Details

### Measuring Management Practices

**Bloom-Van Reenen Survey**:
- 18 management practices scored 1-5
- Based on structured interviews
- Double-blind scoring (interviewer + validator)
- Covers: Monitoring, targets, incentives

**Example questions**:
- "How do you track production problems?"
- "How do you set performance targets?"
- "How is worker performance evaluated?"

### Outcome Measures

**Primary**:
- Quality (defect rates)
- Inventory (stock levels, wastage)
- Labor productivity (output per worker-hour)

**Secondary**:
- Profits (EBITDA)
- Sales
- Employment

**Mechanism**:
- Practice adoption (which practices implemented?)
- Time use (manager time allocation)
- Worker behavior (attendance, turnover)

## Classic Examples

### Example Firm: Treatment Plant

**Before**:
- Quality defects: 15% of output
- Inventory: 2 months of raw materials
- No production tracking
- Workers paid flat wage

**After** (5 months of consulting):
- Defects: 8% (implemented SPC, defect logs)
- Inventory: 1 month (FIFO, better storage)
- Daily production meetings
- Performance-based bonuses

**Result**: 
- Output +22%
- Profits +35%
- ROI on consulting: 250%

## Discussion Notes

From [[14.282 Organizational Economics]]:

**Why India?**
- Large productivity dispersion
- Many family-owned firms (resist change)
- Rapid growth sector (textiles)
- Feasible to measure practices

**Key Debate**: 
> Is management "best practices" or context-dependent?

**Bloom et al. view**: 
- Core practices (quality, inventory, HR) are universal
- Implementation details vary
- Evidence: Same practices work across countries

**Alternative view** (Gibbons):
- Practices must fit organizational context
- Complementarities with strategy, culture
- One-size-fits-all consulting can fail

**Resolution**: 
- **Basic** practices (defect tracking) likely universal
- **Advanced** practices (innovation management) more contextual

## Questions for Further Research

1. **Which practices matter most?** Can we identify "core" vs. "context-dependent"?
2. **What about services?** Do same practices work in non-manufacturing?
3. **How to scale?** Consulting is expensive—can training or peer learning substitute?
4. **Long-run effects?** Do firms continue to improve after consulting ends?
5. **Spillovers?** Do untreated firms learn from treated neighbors?
6. **Cultural barriers?** What role does trust, hierarchy play in adoption?

## Empirical Implications

**Testable predictions**:
1. Management quality → productivity (✓ confirmed)
2. Credit-constrained firms adopt less (partially confirmed)
3. Practices are complementary (confirmed)
4. Family ownership → lower adoption (confirmed)
5. Persistence → organizational learning (confirmed)

**For policy**:
- Subsidize management consulting for SMEs
- Create peer learning networks
- Build local consulting capacity
