## Causation vs. Effectuation (Based on Sarasvathy 2001)

|**Aspect**|**Causation**|**Effectuation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Basic Definition**|Processes that take a particular effect as given and focus on selecting between means to create that effect|Processes that take a set of means as given and focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means|
|**Starting Point**|Predetermined goal/effect|Given set of means (who you are, what you know, whom you know)|
|**Logic**|Logic of prediction: "To the extent we can predict the future, we can control it"|Logic of control: "To the extent we can control the future, we do not need to predict it"|
|**Decision Criteria**|Expected returns; maximize potential returns|Affordable loss; predetermined level of acceptable risk|
|**Approach to Competition**|Competitive analyses (e.g., Porter's five forces)|Strategic alliances and partnerships|
|**Knowledge Use**|Exploitation of preexisting knowledge|Exploitation of contingencies|
|**Future Orientation**|Focus on predictable aspects of uncertain future|Focus on controllable aspects of unpredictable future|
|**Goal Nature**|Preexistent, well-defined goals|Goals emerge and evolve through the process|
|**Process Type**|Many-to-one mappings (many means to one effect)|One-to-many mappings (given means to many possible effects)|
|**Planning Style**|Elaborate planning and prediction|Precommitments to reduce uncertainties|
|**Market Approach**|Market assumed to exist; grab market share|Market created through stakeholder commitments|
|**Example Metaphor**|Chef given a menu, shops for ingredients, cooks the meal|Chef looks in cupboard, sees what's available, creates a meal|
|**Business Context**|Better for well-established markets and clear goals|Better for new venture creation and uncertain environments|
|**Failure Management**|Focus on avoiding failures|Focus on managing failures effectively|
|**Outcome Focus**|Market share in existing markets|New markets created through alliances|

**Key Insight from Paper**: Sarasvathy argues that causation and effectuation are not opposing forces but can work together. Causation is excellent for exploitation (when you know what you want), while effectuation is excellent for exploration (when the future is unpredictable and you're creating something new).
