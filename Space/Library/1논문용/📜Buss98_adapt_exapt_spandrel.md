Adaptation and natural selection are central concepts in the emerging science of evolutionary psychology. Natural selection is the only known causal process capable of producing complex functional organic mechanisms. These adaptations, along with their incidental by-products and a residue of noise, comprise all forms of life. Recently, S. J. [Gould (1991)](http://spider.apa.org/ftdocs/amp/1998/may/amp535533.html#c36) proposed that exaptations and spandrels may be more important than adaptations for evolutionary psychology. These refer to features that did not originally arise for their current use but rather were co-opted for new purposes. He suggested that many important phenomena–such as art, language, commerce, and war–although evolutionary in origin, are incidental spandrels of the large human brain. The authors outline the conceptual and evidentiary standards that apply to adaptations, exaptations, and spandrels and discuss the relative utility of these concepts for psychological science.

| Introduction 🧠                              | - Evolutionary psychology synthesizes evolutionary theory with psychological phenomena<br>- Concepts of adaptation and natural selection are central<br>- Criticism exists about the importance of natural selection and adaptation                                                                                      |
| The Evolutionary Process 🧭🌏                | - Evolution involves changes in organic structure over time<br>- Darwin's theory has three key ingredients: variation, inheritance, and selection<br>- Natural selection works through differential reproductive success<br>- Inclusive fitness theory expands classical fitness to include effects on genetic relatives |
| Products of the Evolutionary Process 🌏      | - Three main products: adaptations, by-products, and random effects<br>- Adaptations are inherited characteristics that facilitate reproduction<br>- By-products are non-functional characteristics coupled with adaptations<br>- Random effects are neutral mutations that neither help nor harm                        |
| Constraints on Optimal Design 🧭             | - Evolution is slow, causing time lags in adaptation<br>- Local optima can prevent better solutions<br>- Lack of genetic variation limits possible adaptations<br>- Costs of building adaptations create constraints<br>- Need for coordination with other mechanisms limits optimal design                              |
| Exaptations and Spandrels 🤜                 | - Exaptations are features co-opted for new functions<br>- Two types: co-opted adaptations and co-opted spandrels<br>- Spandrels are side effects of other features<br>- Features must enhance fitness to qualify as exaptations                                                                                         |
| Terminological and Conceptual Confusions 🗺️ | - Six main confusions identified in using these concepts<br>- Includes confusion between adaptation vs. psychological adjustment<br>- Confusion between current utility vs. past functionality<br>- Confusion between function vs. functionless by-product                                                               |
| The Role of Natural Selection 🌏👓           | - Natural selection is crucial for both adaptations and exaptations<br>- Selection explains original adaptations being co-opted<br>- Selection maintains exaptations over time<br>- Selection causes structural changes in exapted features                                                                              |
| Testing Hypotheses 🧠👓                      | - Evolutionary hypotheses must be precisely formulated<br>- Must coordinate with known evolutionary biology<br>- Should generate testable predictions<br>- Should be more parsimonious than competing hypotheses<br>- Must be computationally capable of solving proposed problems                                       |
| Discussion 👓                                | - Adaptation-based research has produced numerous empirical findings<br>- Exaptation concept hasn't yet led to many empirical discoveries<br>- All evolutionary concepts must meet rigorous scientific standards<br>- Evolutionary psychology remains a promising theoretical perspective                                |
