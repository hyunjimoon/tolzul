Prolonged indecision in the face of market volatility can be detrimental to the startup's survival and growth prospects.                                                                                            | In an unstable market, such as during a global pandemic or significant regulatory changes, a biotech startup developing a COVID-19 vaccine may take longer to pivot to a different product or market segment. The instability in the market may require the startup to gather more data, assess the changing landscape, and adapt their strategies before making a pivoting decision. In contrast, in a stable market, the startup may be able to make quicker decisions based on clear market signals and trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | In an unstable market, a biotech startup developing a novel drug for a rare disease may quickly pivot to a more promising market segment if the initial target market experiences significant disruptions or regulatory hurdles. The rapid changes in the market landscape may prompt the startup to swiftly reallocate resources and adapt its strategy to ensure survival and capitalize on emerging opportunities in alternative market segments.                                                                                                                                                          | Gans et al. (2019) discuss how entrepreneurial strategy is shaped by purposeful learning and experimentation, which aligns with the idea of requiring more time to gather information in unstable markets.<br><br>Camuffo et al. (2020) highlight purposeful experiment (would they take longer to pivot?) how a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision-making involves iterative hypothesis testing and belief updating, suggesting that unstable markets may require more experimentation and learning before pivoting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | more agile = faster speed = faster pivot?<br><br>Murray & Tripsas (2004) emphasize the role of purposeful experimentation in entrepreneurial firms, which supports the idea of startups needing to adapt quickly in unstable markets.<br><br>Sull (2004) discusses the importance of disciplined entrepreneurship, which aligns with the notion of startups being decisive and agile in the face of market volatility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| O: Optimism (gap of belief and real on market acceptance) | A highly optimistic biotech startup targeting the Alzheimer's disease market may initially focus on advancing its novel therapeutic candidate, even in the face of early clinical setbacks. The startup's strong belief in the market potential may drive them to persist longer with their current approach before considering a pivot to a different neurological disorder or treatment modality.                                                                                | A more cautiously optimistic biotech startup in the fiercely competitive immuno-oncology space may be quicker to update its market beliefs and pivot to a specific cancer indication or patient subset where its drug shows the most promising efficacy. The startup may prioritize finding the right market fit over perfecting the product, recognizing the challenges of differentiating itself in a crowded market.                                                                                                                                                                |
| C: Confidence on market acceptance                        | A biotech startup with a high degree of confidence in the market demand for a new gene editing technology, such as CRISPR-based therapies for genetic disorders, may focus more on refining its technical platform and expanding its pipeline to multiple indications. The startup's strong conviction in the market acceptance of gene editing may lead it to stay the course with its core technology, even if early clinical results are mixed.                                 | A biotech startup with less confidence in the market adoption of a novel drug delivery system, such as targeted nanoparticles, may be more willing to pivot its product development efforts if it receives lukewarm interest from pharmaceutical partners or encounters challenges in demonstrating clinical value. The startup may decide to adapt its delivery technology to a different therapeutic area or explore alternative applications where market acceptance seems more promising.                                                                                          |
| E: Experiment opportunity                                 | A well-funded biotech startup pursuing a broad platform technology, such as a new class of small molecule drugs, may have the resources to conduct parallel experiments across multiple therapeutic areas and indications. This allows the startup to update its market beliefs more rapidly and pivot to the most promising opportunities based on data from a diverse set of experiments.                                                                                        | A biotech startup with more limited funding, focusing on a specific indication like a rare genetic disease, may need to allocate its resources more carefully to a smaller number of critical experiments. In this case, the startup may prioritize gathering data to validate and refine its lead product candidate, rather than broadly exploring alternative market applications. The more focused experimentation may lead to a lower degree of updating market beliefs relative to product beliefs.                                                                               |
| R: Risk endurance                                         | A biotech startup with a high risk tolerance, backed by investors who understand the inherent uncertainties in drug development, may be more willing to pursue novel treatment modalities or target indications where the clinical and regulatory path is less well-defined. This risk-tolerant approach may lead the startup to more readily update its market beliefs and pivot to new opportunities as data emerges, even if it means deprioritizing its initial product focus. | A biotech startup with a lower risk appetite, perhaps due to pressure from conservative investors or a need to demonstrate near-term clinical progress, may choose to focus on a more validated treatment approach or a well-established market segment. In this case, the startup may allocate more resources to refining its product and demonstrating clear value within the chosen market, rather than pivoting to potentially riskier or less proven opportunities. The risk-averse strategy may result in a lower degree of updating market beliefs relative to product beliefs. |

| SR: market segment size<br>                             | A biotech startup targeting a large market segment, such as developing a novel cancer immunotherapy, may take longer to pivot compared to a startup focusing on a smaller market segment, like a rare disease. The larger market size offers higher potential revenues and allows for larger sample sizes in clinical trials, which may encourage the startup to persist longer in this segment before considering a pivot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A biotech startup targeting a large market segment, such as developing a new type of insulin for diabetes management, may pivot more quickly to a different market segment if they face intense competition from established players. The presence of multiple competitors in the large market may pressure the startup to differentiate itself rapidly or risk losing market share, thereby prompting a faster pivot to an alternative segment where it can establish a stronger competitive position.                                                                                                       |
| BR: belief and real gap<br><br>(optimism)               | A biotech startup may initially believe that there is a high demand for a new type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for treating solid tumors. However, if the actual market demand is lower than expected or if the development of the ADC faces unexpected scientific challenges, there will be a gap between the startup's beliefs and reality. In this case, the startup may need more time and experiments to validate their assumptions, potentially leading to a longer time to pivot to a different approach or market segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A biotech startup may have a strong belief in the potential of their novel gene editing technology for treating a specific genetic disorder. However, if clinical trials reveal that the therapy is less effective than anticipated or faces unexpected safety concerns, the large gap between the startup's initial optimism and the actual market reception may prompt them to pivot quickly to a different application of their technology or a new therapeutic area altogether, in order to minimize further resource investment in an underperforming direction.                                         |
| DB: Diffuseness of prior belief<br><br>(confidence)<br> | - A biotech startup focusing on developing a novel gene therapy for a rare genetic disorder (Dravet syndrome) may stick with this market segment longer if there is high uncertainty about the therapy's efficacy and market potential. They may conduct more preclinical to gather evidence and reduce uncertainty before considering a pivot to a different therapeutic area or indication.<br><br>- A biotech startup that has invested heavily in the development of a particular drug based on strong initial evidence might delay pivoting, even in the face of emerging research that suggests limited efficacy. Their high confidence in the original research and commitment to the drug's potential may make them less responsive to new, contradictory information, thus extending the time needed to reassess their market strategy and possibly pivot to alternative treatments. | A biotech startup with a novel drug delivery platform may have a diffused prior belief about which therapeutic area to target. As they gather more evidence from market research and scientific studies, they may quickly pivot to a specific disease area that shows the most promise for their technology, as their initial uncertainty allows for more flexibility in adapting their strategy based on new information. The startup's openness to change, given their lack of strong initial convictions, may enable a faster pivot when presented with compelling data supporting a particular direction. |
| ER: Experiment opportunity (function of capital)        | A well-funded biotech startup with a large capital base may have the resources to conduct more extensive preclinical and clinical trials for their lead drug candidate. This financial cushion allows them to gather more comprehensive data before deciding whether to pivot to a different drug candidate or therapeutic area. In contrast, a startup with limited capital may need to make pivoting decisions earlier based on a smaller set of experimental results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A well-funded biotech startup developing a novel gene therapy may be able to simultaneously test its application in multiple rare genetic disorders. With the financial resources to conduct parallel experiments, the startup can quickly gather evidence on the therapy's efficacy across different indications. This approach allows the startup to rapidly identify the most promising target market and pivot accordingly, as they can compare results from multiple experiments and make a data-driven decision in a shorter timeframe.                                                                 |
| CT (Capital Threshold to pivot Market)<br><br>          | A biotech startup with a high  capital threshold (e.g., requiring a high return on investment or a certain market) may have a longer time to pivot market if their current pair of product feature and market segment fails to meet expectations. For example, a startup with high capital threshold may quickly pivot to a different cancer type or therapeutic modality, once the early clinical trial results do not show a significant improvement over existing treatments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | A biotech startup with a high capital threshold, developing a cell therapy for a specific type of cancer, may rapidly pivot to a different oncology indication if early clinical results fail to meet their ambitious growth targets. The startup's high expectations for financial returns and market share may drive them to quickly reallocate resources towards a more promising market segment that has a better chance of delivering the desired outcomes, rather than persisting with the initial indication and risking further capital investment on a suboptimal strategy.                          |

| DR: Market Instability, volatility<br>                      | Sommer et al. (2009): [[📜Trial-and-error learning and parallel pursuit of alternatives in managing uncertainty]]<br>Novel startup companies often face not only risk, but also unforeseeable uncertainty (the inability to recognize and articulate all relevant variables affecting performance). The literature recognizes that established risk planning methods are very powerful when the nature of risks is well understood, but that they are insufficient for managing unforeseeable uncertainty. For this case, two fundamental approaches have been identified: trial-and-error learning, or actively searching for information and repeatedly changing the goals and course of action as new information emerges, and selectionism, or pursuing several approaches in parallel to see ex post what works best. Based on a sample of 58 startups in Shanghai, we test predictions from prior literature on the circumstances under which selectionism or trial-and-error learning leads to higher performance. We find that the best approach depends on a combination of uncertainty and complexity of the startup: risk planning is sufficient when both are low; trial-and-error learning promises the highest potential when unforeseeable uncertainty is high, and selectionism is preferred when both unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity are high, provided that the choice of the best trial can be delayed until its true market performance can be assessed.<br><br><br>Girotra & Netessine (2011): [[📜How to build risk in your business model]]<br>To create value, companies typically focus on revenue, cost structure, and resource velocity. Improving those factors is the main focus of management literature. But all of them are vulnerable to sharp changes in demand and supply.<br><br>Companies can innovate their business models to reduce the impact of such swings. But they can also create value by adding some risk. For instance, more than 30 years ago Rolls-Royce identified a major pain point in the aircraft industry: maintenance of airplane engines. An engine breakdown grounds the plane while the airline pays for repair time and materials. So Rolls-Royce offered a service contract whereby the airline would pay for an engine’s flight hours rather than for time and materials. The new contract triggered a completely new value creation dynamic, because Rolls-Royce was motivated to improve its own products and maintenance processes.<br><br>Business model innovations are much cheaper than product and technology innovations, and they can be approached in a systematic way. Furthermore, nearly all the big ones have already been done—so you can simply adapt them to suit your own situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The supposition that traditional strategy typologies are inadequate to describe the breadth of differentiation exhibited among new ventures was supported. Factor and cluster analysis revealed six generic new venture strategy archetypes that can be distinguished along two dimensions; scope of segmentation, and product vs. marketing emphasis. The extent to which the archetypes tend to dominate in different industries was found to vary according to the industry's position on the industry supply chain. Strategies with a narrow scope of segmentation tended to prevail in industries near the end of the supply chain, whereas those that adopted a broad approach tended to predominate in industries near the beginning or middle of the supply chain.<br><br><br>[Bhargava et al.

We examine these issues for a platform firm that serves two markets, labeled as user and developer markets, with the latter emerging after the user market is proven. While the size of each market positively impacts participation in the other, our model allows for uncertainty regarding developer participation. We demonstrate that product versioning is an especially attractive strategy for platform firms, i.e., the tradeoff between market size and margins is tilted in the direction of more versions. However, when expanding the product line carries substantial fixed costs (e.g., marketing cost, cost of additional plant, managing multiple sets of inventory, increased distribution cost) then the uncertainty in developer participation adversely impacts the firm’s ability to offer multiple versions. We show that for established firms with lower uncertainty about developer participation, the choice is essentially between an expanded or minimal product line. Startups and firms that are entering a new product category are more likely to benefit from a “wait and see” deferred expansion strategy. Still, we demonstrate that uncertainty in developer participation can make early expansion desirable because it expands the installed base and, with the consequent increase in developer participation levels, increases the long-term incremental gain from product line expansion.<br><br>[[📜Bhargava12]][Commercialization of Platform Technologies: Launch Timing and Versioning Strategy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1692252) <br><br>Many emerging entrepreneurial applications and services connect two or more groups of users over Internet-based information technologies.

| BR: belief and real gap<br><br>(optimism)                   | [Jiang & Liu (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3242238):[[ 📜Impact of managerial optimism on competition and firm outcomes]]<br>Research has shown that many managers and entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic and are inclined to believe that negative shocks happen to them less frequently than to others. However, there is also evidence suggesting that such optimism is often inaccurate in reality and managerial optimism can lead to the failure of a company. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the impact of managerial optimism on firms’ performance in a competitive market. Our analysis shows that a manager’s optimism about demand can increase the firm’s profit. Moreover, only one firm having managerial optimism can be win-win for both firms in a duopoly, because it can increase the level of product quality differentiation between the firms, alleviating price competition. However, if both firms have optimistic managers, the benefit of increased differentiation disappears, and firms are weakly worse off, compared with the case of both firms having realistic managers. Our research suggests that a firm should hire a realistic manager when managerial optimism is already pervasive in a competitive market.<br><br>[Shepherd & Patzelt (2013): Operational entrepreneurship and technology commercialization](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.mit.edu/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/sej.3)<br>Although (opportunity) beliefs are becoming increasingly recognized as fundamental to understanding entrepreneurial cognition and strategic action, little is understood about the mechanisms that are responsible for the formation and evolution of these beliefs. Introducing the mechanisms of gists, matching, and updating from philosophy’s and psychology’s coherence theory, we propose a theoretical framework to explain how third-person opportunity beliefs (beliefs that one has recognized an opportunity for someone with the right knowledge and motivation) are formed and how they evolve to become fi rst-person opportunity beliefs (beliefs that one has recognized an opportunity for himself or herself). We conclude by examining how the model contributes to literatures ranging from entrepreneurial cognition and action, to strategic myopia and organizational attention, to opportunity recognition, discovery, and creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| DB: Diffuseness of prior belief<br><br>(confidence)<br>     | Hora & Dutta (2013): [[📜Outcome of young biotech firms' investment in alliances amidst participation uncertainty]]<br>Leaders are important social actors in organizations, centrally involved in establishing and maintaining institutional values, a view that was articulated by Philip Selznick (1957) nearly a half-century ago, but often overlooked in institutionalists' accounts. Our objective is to build on Selznick's seminal work to investigate the value proposition of leadership consistent with institutional theory. We examine public interview transcripts from 52 senior executives and discover that leaders' conceptualizations of their entities align with the archetypes of organization (i.e., economic, hierarchical, and power oriented) and institution (i.e., ideological, creative and collectivist) and cohere around a set of relevant values. Extrapolating from this, we advance a theoretical framework of the process whereby leaders' claims function as transformational mechanisms of value infusion in the institutionalization of organizations.<br><br>[Revising Commitments: Field Evidence on the Adjustment of Prior Choices](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.mit.edu/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12378)<br>The very poor in developing countries often make intertemporal choices that seem at odds with their individual self-interest. There are many possible reasons why. We investigate several of these reasons with a lab-in-the-field experiment in rural Malawi involving large stakes. We make two contributions. First, we construct a new dependent variable: revisions of prior choices regarding the allocation of future income. This allows us to directly examine intertemporal choice revision and its determinants. In particular, this dependent variable permits a novel test for the existence of self-control problems: we find that revisions of money allocations toward the present are positively associated with measures of present-bias from an earlier baseline survey, as well as the (randomly assigned) closeness in time to the first possible date of money disbursement. Second, we investigate other potential determinants of revision, aside from self-control problems. We find little evidence that revisions of money allocations toward the present are associated with spousal preferences for such revision, household shocks or the financial sophistication of respondents.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
