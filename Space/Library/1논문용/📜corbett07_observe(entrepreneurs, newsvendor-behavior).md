This work empirically assesses the degree to which inventory decisions made by entrepreneurs  
and small businesses are informed by the logic underlying the newsvendor or base stock model  
and are influenced by the decision-maker’s risk profile. We used a web- and email-based survey,  
combined with a telephone follow-up to elicit risk profiles, obtaining 51 usable responses. Our  
findings suggest that entrepreneurs do follow the newsvendor logic, but more so for high-margin  
than for best-selling products. We find that entrepreneurs’ risk profiles are consistent with a key  
prediction from prospect theory, displaying risk aversion for profits and risk-seeking behavior for  
losses. Furthermore, we find that risk aversion for profits is associated with higher safety stocks,  
in contradiction to existing theory, and discuss several possible explanations for this finding.
