| 2              | we have no experience of a necessary connection between events | If everything we know comes from experience, this immediately raises a problem. How could we ever make predictions about the future? After all, we can never  experience the future. Thankfully, we can make use ofa  handy principle called cause and effect.  Inthe past, we've learned that certain events cause other  events. All we need to do is transpose that knowledge into the  future, and we have a method for making predictions about what's going to happen. So, let's imagine you're playing a  3/9 18min left  — =   experience of a necessary connection between events.  When we think about the relationship of cause and effect, we  imagine it as a necessary relationship. In other words, we believe that there's something in the cause that by the laws of nature produces a certain effect and couldn't possibly  produce any other effect. For example, if you were to put your  unprotected handina fire, it would burn. You don't believe it would freeze your hand or turnit to stone because it's not in the nature of fire to do that. But where does this idea of necessity come from? Remember, Hume's empirical method  gives us a handy way of identifying where an idea comes  from.  We need only to point to the impression that caused it. So, where then have we experienced this idea of necessity? Well, nowhere. We've never experienced necessary causation. All we've ever experienced is one event frequently followed by  another. For example, we've experienced fire followed by burning plenty of times, but not once have we ever experienced fire necessarily followed by burning.  There's nothing in an experience itself that tells us that an effect is the one and only effect that possibly could have arisen. Since we've no experience of necessity, Hume invites us to rethink our idea of cause and effect as merely constant conjunction between events. In other words, all we ever  experience is that some events frequently follow other events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Chapter 3 of 3 | inductive reasoning can't be justified rationally              | OK, so we might not directly experiencea necessary link between cause and effect, but what if we could  use reason to find out if there's a connection? Well, let's give it  ago. When we're trying to determine a general theory, like the  necessary connection of cause and effect, we usually use  inductive reasoning. This is the form of reasoning used when we draw general conclusions froma synthesis of several specific observations.  It's the mode of thinking operating in the background when we make inferences about the future based on past observations, like inferring that fire will burn us again in the  future because it has done so in the past. But Hume famously criticised the validity of this form of reason. Inductive reasoning, he argues, is viciously circular. The key message here is, inductive reasoning can't be justified rationally. Let's  consider an example that pretty much everyone agrees with. Weall believe that the sun is going to rise tomorrow morning and then the morning after that.  Why do we believe this? Well, based on inductive reasoning.  The sun has risen every other day of our lives, so we feel pretty confident that it'll rise tomorrow as well. You might think this is solid reasoning. The problemis, in order for the  argument to work, we need to make a big assumption. We need to assume that things will continue to behave in the  future as they've done in the past.  4/9 13min left  Se =   This assumption is impossible to prove. We can't experience  the future directly, nor can we define the underlying causes  of the universe with absolute certainty. Our laws of physics  are based entirely on past observation, and for all we know,  they could change overnight. Now maybeit strikes youas  just plain obvious that the laws of physics are going to remain stable into the future. They've remained stable all your life, so  they're probably not going to change now, right? But notice, if you try to justify the future stability of the laws of physics by pointing to the past, then you're using inductive reasoning.  And what did Hume teach us about inductive reasoning?  That it only works if we take it for granted that the future will be like the past. Therefore, you're assuming the very thing you're trying to prove. In philosophy, this is called vicious circularity. Inductive reasoning, then, can't be justified  rationally. We have no choice but to accept the remarkable conclusion that we have no rational justification for believing the sun will rise tomorrow.                                                                         |
| Chapter4 of 7  | humans think instinctually rather than rationally              | So, Hume has shown that we have no rational basis for making any inferences about the future. But don't let this put you off planning for tomorrow. Hume was the first to admit that there's a natural limit to this kind of skeptical reasoning. We might not be rationally justified in habitual connection between the two events. So when we see the first event, our minds lead us to expect the second. That's all there is to it. Consider, for example, the way young children learn. Clearly, children are able to form associations between events, even if they don't do it consciously. They learn, for instance, that when they touch a candle's flame, it hurts. So, eventually, they learn to avoid touching flames altogether. Do children discover this through some abstract process of reasoning? Of course not. Children don't learn through reason but through instinct. And it's a good thing that they do, too, because instinct is a lot more reliable than reason is. Could you imagine if humans experienced the world as a chain of completely disconnected events and we had to piece the world together through a conscious process of reasoning from cause to effect before we made any decision? Humans would have died out a long time ago, that's for sure.This natural instinct for inductive reasoning isn't unique to humans either. Animals, too, learn from their experiences and come to associate causes with effects. Dogs, for instance, learn to associate the sound of a whistle with their owner or the sight of their bowl with food. It's clear that dogs infer something that's beyond their immediate perception and this inference is based on past experience. It turns out, then, that the way humans think is far closer to our animal cousins than we may care to admit. We, too, are creatures of habit and instinct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Chapter 5 of 7 | ⭐️Human action is both free and determined.                    | If it's true that humans are guided more by  instinct than by reason, this raises another problem. If reasoning doesn't have any influence on our behaviour, if we're just animals governed by blind instinct, then what room does that leave for human freedom? This is really just a  reformulation of the free will versus determinism debate  which has been raging in philosophy for centuries. The debate considers howit's possible to reconcile the fact that human actions are causally determined, in this case by our instincts, with our conviction that we have freedom over how  we act in any given situation.  The concepts of free will and determinism seem completely incompatible with one another. But Hume, surprisingly,  doesn't see it this way. For Hume, this whole centuries-long  debate is simply the result of confusion over the words that  philosophers have been using. He suggests that if we only redefine the concepts of free will and determinism along the lines of his theory of cause and effect, thenit'll be plain as day  that free will and determinism are compatible. The key  message here is, human action is both free and determined. As we've seen, Hume argued that the concept of necessary causation is derived from our habits and not from the external world.  By doing this, Hume has opened up the possibility that events could produce any number of effects other than the  ones they actually do. Thus, for example, we could say that So  nw   = "  However, the wax doesn't melt necessarily, and it's always  possible that some other effect will ensue. What's more, just as physical processes exhibit regularities between cause and effect, human action also exhibits regularities between inner motivations and outer behavior. For example, when people  feel hungry, they're generally moved to find something to eat,  and when people feel angry, they often raise their voices. We say that people's inner feelings determine their behavior because we observe that certain kinds of behavior frequently follow from certain kinds of inner states.  However, there's no necessary connection between the two. It's perfectly possible that we don't bother eating despite being hungry or that we keep our voices quiet despite being  angry. Human behavior is therefore on a par with physical  processes in the universe. Both are determined insofar as they both exhibit regularities of cause and effect, and yet there's no necessity between cause and effect in either domain. It's this space between our inner motivations and  outward behavior that's the proper domain of free will. |
