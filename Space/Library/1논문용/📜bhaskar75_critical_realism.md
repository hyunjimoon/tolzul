# 📜 A Realist Theory of Science

## 🗄️1: Core Framework (Q&A Format)

| Section | 🔐Research Question | 🔑Key Message & Framework | 📐Formal Concept | 🧱Literature Brick |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Main Thesis** | What must the world be like for science to be possible? | Reality is **stratified**: empirical (observed), actual (events), and **real** (underlying mechanisms with causal powers) | **Ontological Stratification**: Real → Actual → Empirical | • Kant (transcendental arguments)<br>• Hume (causation critique) |
| **Core Claim** | Why separate ontology from epistemology? | The **epistemic fallacy** conflates being with knowledge. Reality exists independently of our observations | **Intransitive Objects**: Structures exist independently of scientific inquiry | • Popper (falsification)<br>• Kuhn (paradigms) |
| **Key Insight** | How do causal powers work? | Powers are **dispositional** - they may be exercised without being manifested, and exist without being actualized | **Transfactual Causation**: Powers operate even when unobserved | • Harré & Madden (causal powers)<br>• Geach & Anscombe (tendencies) |

## 🗄️3: Transitive vs Intransitive Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Examples | Implications |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Transitive** | Socially produced knowledge (theories, models) | Scientific theories, measurements, paradigms | Fallible, revisable, historically conditioned |
| **Intransitive** | Objects of scientific inquiry (real structures) | Gravity, social structures, causal mechanisms | Exist independently of our knowledge of them |

**Key Insight**: Scientific progress involves refining *transitive* knowledge to better align with *intransitive* realities.

## 🗄️4: Emergence and Stratification

### Emergent Properties
- Wholes possess properties that parts lack
- Higher-level phenomena are **irreducible** to lower levels
- Example: Water (H₂O) extinguishes fire; hydrogen and oxygen are combustible

### Stratified Reality
```
Social Structures (emergent from...)
    ↓
Psychological Processes (emergent from...)
    ↓
Biological Systems (emergent from...)
    ↓
Physical/Chemical Processes
```

## 💭 Critical Insights for Dissertation

### Connection to Strategic Ambiguity
**Bhaskar's Framework Applied to τ (Promise Precision)**:

1. **Empirical Level**: Observable funding outcomes, pivot rates
2. **Actual Level**: All events (including unobserved pivots, internal learning)
3. **Real Level**: *Underlying mechanisms* that generate outcomes
   - Coalition dynamics
   - Belief updating processes
   - Commitment escalation traps

### Why This Matters for Your Research

```
Traditional Approach:
  Empirical → Empirical (correlation)
  "Low τ correlates with later success"

Critical Realist Approach:
  Real → Actual → Empirical (causal mechanism)
  "Strategic ambiguity activates coalition-building mechanisms
   that generate flexible stakeholder networks,
   which produce adaptive capacity,
   which manifests as later success"
```

### Retroduction (Inference to Best Explanation)
- Not just: What patterns do we observe?
- But: What *must* be the case for these patterns to exist?
- Discovering the **generative mechanisms** behind observed regularities

## 🎯 Application to OIL Framework

| OIL Component | Critical Realist Interpretation |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **V (Vagueness)** | Observable promise precision (Empirical) |
| **τ* (Optimal Precision)** | Theoretical construct about Real mechanisms |
| **Coalition Effects** | Generative mechanism in Real domain |
| **Success/Failure** | Actualized outcomes from mechanism activation |

**Methodological Implication**:
- Don't just measure τ → Success correlation
- Identify the **causal powers** that low τ activates
- Test whether these powers are actually exercised

2. **Collier, A. (1994)**. *Critical Realism: An Introduction to Roy Bhaskar's Philosophy* - Accessible introduction

4. **Sayer, A. (1992)**. *Method in Social Science* - Methodological implications

## 🔗 For Your Paper

### How to Cite in Introduction
> "Following critical realist philosophy (Bhaskar, 1975), we distinguish between the *empirical* patterns we observe in startup funding and the *real* generative mechanisms that produce these patterns. Our OIL framework theorizes the causal powers activated by strategic ambiguity."

### Strengthens Your Argument By:
1. Justifying *why* you need mechanism-based explanation
2. Distinguishing your approach from correlational studies
3. Grounding the "generative" claim in established philosophy

**핵심 통찰**: "관찰된 사건을 산출하는 기저의 구조와 힘"
- Reality has *depth* - we must theorize beyond surface patterns
- Causal powers may exist without being exercised
- Emergence is real, not just descriptive convenience

*"The intelligibility of science necessitates the existence of real, stratified structures with causal powers."*
