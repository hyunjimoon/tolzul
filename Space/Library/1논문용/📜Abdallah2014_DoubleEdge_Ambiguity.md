## 🗄️3: Comparison Across Theories

| Dimension | Static Ambiguity Theory | Double Edge Theory | Your OIL Framework |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **τ Over Time** | τ constant | τ should increase | τ*(t) = f(V(t), i(t)) |
| **Early Phase** | Ambiguous = suboptimal | Ambiguous = productive | Low τ* optimal (H1) |
| **Late Phase** | Ambiguous = suboptimal | Ambiguous = destructive | High τ* needed (H2) |
| **Mechanism** | Clarity always better | Trade-off by phase | Bayesian optimization |
| **Empirical Prediction** | Linear τ → outcomes | Non-linear, phase-dependent | U-shaped or phase-interaction |

## 💭 Critical Insights for OIL Framework

> **THE KEY PAPER for H1 ≠ H2**

### Why This Paper is Critical

This paper explains WHY vague promises (low τ) have OPPOSITE effects early vs. late:

**Early Phase (Planning) - PRODUCTIVE**:
```
Low τ → Multiple interpretations → Diverse stakeholders buy in → Coalition formation
But: Reduces certainty → Lower early funding (H1: α₁ < 0)
```

**Late Phase (Execution) - DESTRUCTIVE**:
```
Still low τ → Confusion about direction → Coordination failures → Implementation problems
Unless: Ambiguity resolved → High coalition → Success (H2: β₁ > 0 if τ increases)
```

### Mathematical Connection to OIL

**Abdallah & Langley's Insight**:
```
τ*(t) is NOT constant

Early: τ*ₑₐᵣₗᵧ = max{0, √(Vₑₐᵣₗᵧ/4iₑₐᵣₗᵧ) - 1} → LOW
Late:  τ*ₗₐₜₑ  = max{0, √(Vₗₐₜₑ/4iₗₐₜₑ) - 1}  → HIGH

Because:
- Vₑₐᵣₗᵧ high (uncertain opportunity) → low τ* optimal
- Vₗₐₜₑ lower (learning occurred) → higher τ* optimal
- iₑₐᵣₗᵧ high (exploration mode) → low τ* optimal  
- iₗₐₜₑ lower (exploitation mode) → higher τ* optimal
```

### Implication for Your Hypotheses

**H1 (α₁ < 0)**: Productive ambiguity CAUSES lower early funding
- Mechanism: Vagueness preserves options BUT reduces investor certainty
- This is the PRODUCTIVE SIDE's cost

**H2 (β₁ > 0)**: If ventures successfully transition (increase τ at right time)
- Mechanism: Early ambiguity → broad coalition → later success
- Conditional on: NOT staying in destructive ambiguity zone

**Critical Insight**: 
β₁ > 0 ONLY IF ventures escape the "destructive ambiguity trap"
→ Suggests interaction: (τ₀ low) × (Δτ positive) → success

## 🎯 Research Implications

### For H1: Early Funding (α₁ < 0)
**Mechanism = Productive Ambiguity's Trade-off**:
- Low τ enables coalition → BUT reduces certainty
- Investors require precision → penalize vague promises
- **Result**: α₁ < 0 (early funding penalty)

**Quote from Paper** (conceptually):
"Productive ambiguity facilitates buy-in from diverse parties but creates hesitation from resource providers requiring clear plans"

### For H2: Later Success (β₁ > 0)
**Mechanism = Conditional on Transition**:
- Ventures that START with low τ (productive ambiguity)
- Build broad coalitions
- Then INCREASE τ at right time (avoid destructive ambiguity)
- **Result**: β₁ > 0 (later success)

**Critical Moderator**: Timing of τ increase
- Too early: Kill productive ambiguity → narrow coalition
- Too late: Destructive ambiguity → confusion
- Just right: Maximum coalition + eventual coordination

### New Hypothesis H3 (from this paper)
**H3: Interaction between τ₀ and Δτ**
```
Later Success = β₀ + β₁·τ₀ + β₂·Δτ + β₃·(τ₀ × Δτ)

Where:
- β₁ > 0 (vague initially → broad coalition)
- β₂ > 0 (increase precision → coordination)
- β₃ < 0 (if start high, less benefit from increasing)
```

## 🔬 Empirical Strategy Insights

### Measurement Requirements

**Need to measure τ TRAJECTORY, not just τ₀**:

```python
# From Abdallah & Langley
τ₀ = precision_at_founding  # Initial promise precision
τ₁ = precision_at_first_round  # After first funding
τ₂ = precision_at_later_rounds  # After learning

Δτ_early = τ₁ - τ₀  # Early adjustment
Δτ_late = τ₂ - τ₁  # Late adjustment

# Test interaction
success ~ τ₀ + Δτ_early + Δτ_late + (τ₀ * Δτ_early)
```

### Observable Proxies

**Productive Ambiguity** (early):
- Number of distinct stakeholder types attracted
- Breadth of coalition formed
- Diversity of board/investors

**Destructive Ambiguity** (late):
- Coordination failures (delays, pivots)
- Internal conflicts reported
- Turnover of key personnel

**Successful Transition**:
- Explicit strategic clarifications in communications
- Narrowing of product scope
- Increasing specificity in milestones

## 🗺️ Key Examples from Paper

### 1. **Strategic Planning Process**
- **Early**: Ambiguous mission statement → Gets everyone on board
- **Late**: Still ambiguous → "What are we actually doing?"
- **Solution**: Clarify during implementation without losing coalition

### 2. **Product Development**
- **Early**: Vague product vision → Attracts diverse technical expertise
- **Late**: Still vague → Engineering team doesn't know what to build
- **Solution**: Specify requirements while maintaining strategic flexibility

## 🔍 Questions This Paper Raises

1. **Timing**: WHEN exactly should ventures increase τ?
   - After seed round? After Series A?
   - Event-driven (product-market fit)?
   - Time-driven (12 months)?

2. **Rate of Change**: How FAST should τ increase?
   - Gradual (smooth transition)?
   - Discrete jumps (pivots)?
   - Domain-dependent?

3. **Reversibility**: Can ventures GO BACK to low τ?
   - If environment becomes more uncertain?
   - Strategic pivots require re-ambiguity?

4. **Measurement Challenge**: How to distinguish:
   - Productive ambiguity (good) vs.
   - Destructive ambiguity (bad) vs.
   - Optimal ambiguity (τ*)
