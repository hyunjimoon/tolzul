# Contractibility and the Design of Research Agreements

## Summary
Examines R&D contracts between biotech firms and pharmaceutical companies to test property rights theory predictions. When research is non-contractable (early stage), contracts more frequently include termination rights coupled with broad IP transfers, but only when biotech firms face financial constraints. Provides clean empirical test distinguishing control rights mechanisms from alternative explanations.

## Research Question
How do financial constraints and contractibility of research outcomes affect the allocation of control rights in R&D agreements?

## Key Concepts

### Contractibility
**Non-contractable research**: Early-stage projects where outcomes cannot be fully specified ex ante
**Contractable research**: Later-stage projects with clearer milestones and deliverables

### Termination Rights with IP Transfer
Special clause allowing pharma firm to exit contract at any time while:
- Relinquishing rights to patents
- Paying penalty fees to biotech

This mitigates risk that biotech will divert funds to other projects while maintaining biotech incentives.

## Main Results

### Main Finding
Termination-with-IP-transfer clauses appear more frequently when:
1. Research is non-contractable (early stage)
2. Biotech firm is financially constrained

The relationship disappears for financially secure biotech firms.

### Placebo Test
Contracts with termination rights alone (no IP transfer) show no such pattern, confirming the theoretical mechanism.

### Contrasts with Earlier Work
Lerner & Merges (1998) found control shifted to pharma for early-stage projects, but without distinguishing financial constraints or properly weighing control provisions.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: This paper demonstrates how to properly test incomplete contracting theory - by identifying specific contractual clauses that theory predicts and showing the pattern disappears when key assumptions (financial constraints) are relaxed.

### Methodology Innovation
Not all control rights are equal - must identify which specific provisions theory predicts and weight them appropriately rather than simple counts.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Analysis of biotech research agreements
**Data**: 580 contracts from ReCap database of biotech-pharma agreements
**Outcome**: Indicator for termination-with-IP-transfer clause presence
**Key Variables**:
- Research stage (proxy for contractibility)
- Biotech financial constraints
- Contract characteristics

**Identification**: Conditional correlation analysis with placebo tests using similar but theoretically distinct clauses
