## 🎯 Investment Thesis

### "Dare to Do Legendary Things"

> "The best founders don't compete in existing markets - they create new ones where they are the only player."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Pattern Breaking**: Best startups break patterns, not follow them
2. **Legendary > Incremental**: Aim for category creation
3. **Idea Frameworks**: Structured approach to evaluating breakthrough potential
4. **"Taught me how to invest"**: Foundational thinking for early-stage

### Startup Idea Frameworks:
- **Inflection theory**: What technology/social change enables this NOW?
- **Non-consensus right**: Must be contrarian AND correct
- **Living in the future**: Founders who see what others don't

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

Mike Maples represents the **extreme Believer investor**:
- Invests at V≈1 when others see nothing
- Focuses on "will this change the world?" not "do the numbers work?"
- Category creation over market share capture

### The "Legendary" Test (V≈1 requirement):
```
Incremental (V≈0.3): "10% better mousetrap"     → Pass
Category (V≈0.7):    "New way to catch mice"    → Maybe
Legendary (V≈1.0):   "World without mice"       → FUND
```

## 📋 Notable Investments

| Company | V Level | Category Created | Outcome |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Twitter** | 1.0 | Real-time public conversation | IPO |
| **Twitch** | 0.9 | Live game streaming | $970M (Amazon) |
| **Lyft** | 0.9 | Ridesharing | IPO |
| **Okta** | 0.7 | Identity management | IPO |
| **Chegg** | 0.6 | Student services | IPO |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On pattern breaking:**
> "Pattern breakers don't win by being better at someone else's game. They change the game entirely."

> **On timing (inflection theory):**
> "The best founders are living in the future and building what's missing."

> **On non-consensus:**
> "If everyone agrees your idea is great, you're probably too late."

## 🔄 Maples' Framework Applied to Paper U

| Founder Type | Mike's View | Paper U Mapping |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Incrementalist** | "Won't fund" | V≈0, Analyst channel |
| **Category Creator** | "Interesting" | V≈0.5-0.7, Murky middle risk |
| **Pattern Breaker** | "FUND" | V≈1, Believer channel |

### Why "Legendary" Avoids Murky Middle:
- Forces binary choice: legendary or not
- No "pretty good" investments
- Either V≈1 (fund) or V<0.5 (pass)
- Murky middle (V≈0.5) automatically rejected
