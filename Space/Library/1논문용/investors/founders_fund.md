# Founders Fund

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Venture Capital |
| **Style** | Believer (vision-focused) |
| **Sector** | Deep Tech, Space, AI, Biotech |
| **Stage** | Seed - Series B |
| **AUM** | $11B+ |
| **Founded** | 2005 (Peter Thiel) |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

> "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."

### Core Beliefs:
1. **Contrarian** bets on transformative technology
2. **Long time horizons** (10+ years to outcome OK)
3. **Founder-centric** (back exceptional people, not just markets)
4. **Monopoly potential** over incremental improvement

### What They Look For:
- "0 to 1" innovations (not "1 to n")
- Founders with unique insights
- Technologies that seem impossible to most
- Large TAM (even if speculative)

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

Founders Fund represents the **Believer investor type**:
- Project their own vision onto founder's narrative
- Less focused on near-term metrics
- High tolerance for ambiguity (V≈1)

### Companies They'd Fund (V≈1):
- SpaceX ("colonize Mars")
- Anduril ("rebuild defense")
- Stripe (early, "internet payments infrastructure")

### Companies They'd Question (V≈0):
- Incremental SaaS improvements
- "Better mousetrap" without vision
- Cost reduction plays

## 📋 Notable Space/Mobility Investments

| Company | Sub-sector | Thesis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **SpaceX** | Launch + Starlink | Multi-planetary civilization |
| **Anduril** | Defense tech | Rebuild American defense |
| **Relativity Space** | 3D-printed rockets | Manufacturing revolution |

## 🔄 Contrast with Space Capital

| Dimension | Space Capital (Analyst) | Founders Fund (Believer) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Core question** | "Does this make money?" | "Could this change everything?" |
| **Time horizon** | 5-7 years | 10-20 years |
| **Risk tolerance** | Moderate | High |
| **Vagueness preference** | V≈0 (precise) | V≈1 (visionary) |
| **Due diligence focus** | Unit economics | Founder + vision |

## 💡 Paper U Implication

Founders Fund's success with V≈1 companies (SpaceX, Palantir) supports the hypothesis that:
- **High vagueness can succeed** when matched with Believer investors
- The "murky middle" (V≈0.5) fails because it attracts neither Analyst nor Believer
