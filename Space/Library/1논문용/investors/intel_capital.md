# Intel Capital (Mobility Practice)

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Corporate Venture Capital |
| **Style** | Analyst (integration-focused) |
| **Sector** | Autonomous Driving, ADAS, Mobility |
| **Stage** | Series B+ |
| **Parent** | Intel Corporation |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

> "Invest in technologies that can integrate with and enhance our autonomous driving platform."

### Core Beliefs:
1. **OEM integration path** is essential
2. **Proven technology** over speculative R&D
3. **Supply chain fit** with existing automotive ecosystem
4. **Revenue visibility** within 3-5 years

### What They Look For:
- Clear technical specifications
- OEM relationships or potential
- Regulatory pathway clarity
- Unit economics at scale

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

Intel Capital represents the **Analyst investor type** in AV:
- Acquired Mobileye for $15.3B (V≈0 company)
- Focus on verifiable technology claims
- Integration potential over pure vision

### The Mobileye Model (V≈0):
- "EyeQ chip: 36 TOPS at 5W"
- Clear OEM contracts
- Measurable safety improvements
- Path to revenue from day one

### What They Avoided:
- L5 autonomy without clear timeline
- Consumer robotaxi plays (too speculative)
- Hardware without software moat

## 📋 Key AV Investments

| Company | Focus | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mobileye** | ADAS chips | $15.3B acquisition → IPO |
| **Moovit** | Transit data | $900M acquisition |
| **Chronocam** | Event cameras | Acquired |

## 🔄 Contrast with SoftBank Vision Fund

| Dimension | Intel Capital (Analyst) | SoftBank Vision (Believer) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AV thesis** | "ADAS now, full autonomy later" | "L5 will transform everything" |
| **Key bets** | Mobileye (V≈0) | Cruise, Nuro (V≈0.7-0.9) |
| **Time horizon** | 3-5 years | 10+ years |
| **Outcome focus** | Revenue, OEM deals | Market transformation |
| **Risk tolerance** | Moderate | Very high |

## 💡 Paper C Relevance: Commitment Trap

Intel's strategic approach avoided the commitment trap:
1. **Acquired proven technology** (Mobileye) vs. building from scratch
2. **OEM validation** before full commitment
3. **Maintained optionality** (Mobileye as separate unit, later IPO)

### Contrast: SoftBank's Cruise Investment
- $2.25B at V≈0.8 (L4/L5 vision)
- Committed before market validation
- GM integration challenges
- 2023-2024 major setbacks
