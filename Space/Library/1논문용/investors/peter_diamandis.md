# Peter Diamandis / XPRIZE / Abundance360

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Ecosystem Builder / Investor |
| **Style** | Extreme Believer |
| **Sector** | Space, Longevity, AI, Resources |
| **Vehicles** | XPRIZE, Singularity U, Abundance360 |
| **Philosophy** | "The best way to predict the future is to create it" |

## 🎯 Investment/Building Thesis

### "Exponential Thinking"

> "The day before something is a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **The best way to predict the future**: Create it
2. **The exponential era**: Technology curves are exponential, not linear
3. **Exponential thinking**: Train your mind to see curves, not lines
4. **The future is faster than you think**: Most underestimate speed

### Key Frameworks:

| Framework | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **6 D's** | Digitization → Deception → Disruption → Demonetization → Dematerialization → Democratization |
| **Moonshots** | 10x thinking, not 10% |
| **Abundance** | Technology creates abundance, not scarcity |
| **XPRIZE** | Incentive competitions for breakthroughs |

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

### Exponential Thinking = V≈1 Investment Philosophy

Diamandis's framework explains Believer investor psychology:

```
Linear investor (Analyst):
  "Current trend → 10% improvement → 5 years"
  → Prefers V≈0 (verify extrapolation)

Exponential investor (Believer):
  "Current inflection → 10x transformation → unpredictable"
  → Prefers V≈1 (can't verify, must believe)
```

### The "Deception" Phase Problem

Exponential technologies have a "deception phase":
- Growth looks flat/failing
- Looks like failure to Analyst investors
- Only Believer investors stay invested

**Paper U implication**: V≈1 companies in deception phase need Believer capital
- Analyst sees: "No traction after 3 years"
- Believer sees: "Still in deception, doubling quarterly"

## 📋 XPRIZE Portfolio (Moonshot Investments)

| XPRIZE | Sector | V Level | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Ansari XPRIZE** | Space | 1.0 | SpaceShip One (won) |
| **Google Lunar XPRIZE** | Space | 1.0 | Progress, no winner |
| **Carbon XPRIZE** | Climate | 0.9 | Multiple finalists |
| **Avatar XPRIZE** | Robotics | 1.0 | Ongoing |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On prediction:**
> "The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself."

> **On exponential curves:**
> "Linear thinking is the default. Exponential thinking must be trained."

> **On moonshots:**
> "If you're not embarrassed by your first moonshot, you're not thinking big enough."

> **On timing (deception phase):**
> "During the deception phase, exponential technology looks like failure. This is when you should invest."

## 🔄 6 D's → Paper U Mapping

| D Phase | V Optimal | Investor Type |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Digitization** | 0.3 | Analyst (verify tech) |
| **Deception** | 1.0 | Believer only (looks like failure) |
| **Disruption** | 0.7 | Both (proof emerging) |
| **Demonetization** | 0.5 | Analyst (business model clear) |
| **Dematerialization** | 0.5 | Analyst (scaling) |
| **Democratization** | 0.3 | Analyst (mass market) |

### Key Insight for Paper U:

Optimal V changes through technology lifecycle:
- **Early (Deception)**: V≈1 required (only believers fund)
- **Mid (Disruption)**: V≈0.7 works (hybrid)
- **Late (Democratization)**: V≈0 works (metrics clear)
