# Katherine Boyle / a16z American Dynamism

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | VC (a16z Partner) |
| **Style** | Believer (mission-driven) |
| **Sector** | Defense, Govtech, Aerospace, Manufacturing |
| **Stage** | Seed - Series B |
| **Fund** | a16z American Dynamism |
| **Philosophy** | "Rebuilding America" |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

### "American Dynamism"

> "We invest in founders who are building in sectors vital to American interests—aerospace, defense, education, housing, transportation, and more."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Govtech and American dynamism**: Government as customer, not obstacle
2. **Mission-driven founders**: Veterans, aerospace engineers, patriots
3. **Regulated markets**: Complexity as moat
4. **Long-term contracting**: Defense = recurring revenue

### Sector Focus:

| Sector | Why "Dynamic" |
|:---|:---|
| **Defense** | US needs tech edge, legacy contractors slow |
| **Aerospace** | SpaceX proved disruption possible |
| **Manufacturing** | Reshoring = national priority |
| **Infrastructure** | Crumbling systems need tech |
| **Education** | Human capital development |

## 🔬 Paper U/C Relevance

### Paper U: Govtech = Unique V Dynamics

Government-focused startups have unusual optimal V:

| Customer | Optimal V | Why |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Consumer** | 0 or 1 | Mass market or vision |
| **Enterprise** | 0.3-0.5 | ROI focus |
| **Government** | 0.6-0.8 | Mission + capability |

**Government buyer psychology**:
- Needs to believe in mission (Believer)
- Needs to verify capability (Analyst)
- Must justify to oversight (Documentation)

**Result**: V≈0.7 may be optimal for govtech
- "We will transform [agency] capability" (vision)
- "Using proven technology X, Y, Z" (verification)

### Paper C: Defense as Trap-Resistant Sector

Defense startups may avoid commitment trap:

| Trap Mechanism | Defense Counter |
|:---|:---|
| No market feedback | Contract milestones = feedback |
| Echo chamber | Government PMs provide reality |
| Pivot impossible | Contracts are modular |

**But also trap-prone**:
- Mission commitment can blind
- Classified work limits outside input
- Founder-veteran identity tied to approach

## 📋 Notable American Dynamism Investments

| Company | Sector | V Level | Mission |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Anduril** | Defense | 0.9 | "Rebuild American defense" |
| **Hadrian** | Manufacturing | 0.7 | "Aerospace supply chain" |
| **Epirus** | Defense | 0.8 | "Directed energy weapons" |
| **Skydio** | Drones | 0.7 | "Autonomous drones for all" |
| **Shield AI** | Defense AI | 0.8 | "AI pilot for military" |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On American dynamism:**
> "For too long, Silicon Valley ignored sectors that matter most to American security and prosperity."

> **On mission-driven founders:**
> "The best defense founders are often veterans who saw the problem firsthand and decided to fix it."

> **On government as customer:**
> "Government is the most patient, most mission-aligned, most recurring customer you can have."

## 🔄 American Dynamism → Thesis Framework

| AD Principle | Paper | Application |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Mission + metrics | U | V≈0.7 optimal zone |
| Government feedback | C | Built-in doubt mechanism |
| Sector expertise | N | Pure strategy (govtech) |

### Defense Portfolio as Paper N Test

American Dynamism portfolio = pure strategy test:
- All companies target same customer type (government)
- All share similar V profile (0.6-0.8)
- Diversified within segment (defense, infra, etc.)

**Hypothesis**: Pure govtech strategy > mixed consumer+govtech
