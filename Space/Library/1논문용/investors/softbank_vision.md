# SoftBank Vision Fund (Mobility)

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Corporate VC / Growth Equity |
| **Style** | Believer (transformation-focused) |
| **Sector** | Mobility, AV, Logistics, Transportation |
| **Stage** | Series A-C (large checks) |
| **AUM** | $100B+ (Vision Fund 1&2) |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

> "Bet big on companies that will define the future of mobility."

### Core Beliefs:
1. **Full autonomy (L5)** will transform transportation
2. **Winner-take-most** dynamics in mobility
3. **Capital as moat** - fund companies to outspend competitors
4. **Long time horizons** acceptable for transformative bets

### What They Look For:
- Category-defining potential
- Large addressable markets
- Founder with ambitious vision
- Willingness to pursue "blitzscaling"

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

SoftBank Vision Fund represents the **Believer investor type** in mobility:
- Invests at V≈0.8-1.0 (visionary promises)
- Less focused on near-term unit economics
- "Change the world" narrative essential

### High-V Investments:
- **Cruise** ($2.25B): "Full self-driving in cities"
- **Nuro** ($940M): "Autonomous delivery revolution"
- **Uber** (multiple rounds): "Transportation OS"
- **DiDi**: "China's mobility platform"

## ⚠️ Paper C Relevance: Commitment Trap Cases

SoftBank's mobility portfolio provides **commitment trap exemplars**:

### Cruise: Trapped by Vision
```
2018: "L4 autonomy imminent"
      ↓ SoftBank invests $2.25B
2020: "Still testing"
      ↓ More investment to "stay the course"
2023: Pedestrian incident
      ↓ Pause operations
2024: Major restructuring

Pattern: High μ → Believers fund → τ↑ → Can't pivot → Trap
```

### Nuro: Similar Pattern
```
V≈0.9 promise: "Autonomous delivery everywhere"
Reality: Limited deployments, regulatory challenges
Response: Keep pushing same approach (trapped)
```

## 📋 Mobility Portfolio

| Company | Vagueness | Outcome | Trap Status |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| Cruise | 0.8 | Restructuring | Trapped |
| Nuro | 0.9 | Struggling | At risk |
| Uber | 0.7 | IPO (mixed) | Escaped (pivoted from AV) |
| DiDi | 0.6 | Regulatory issues | External shock |
| DoorDash | 0.5 | IPO (success) | Escaped |

## 🔄 Contrast with Intel Capital

| Dimension | SoftBank (Believer) | Intel Capital (Analyst) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vagueness preference** | V≈0.8-1.0 | V≈0-0.3 |
| **Due diligence** | Vision + founder | Technology + economics |
| **AV bet** | Cruise (L4/L5) | Mobileye (L2/L3) |
| **Outcome** | Struggling | $15B acquisition, IPO |

## 💡 Key Insight for Paper U/C

SoftBank's portfolio demonstrates:
1. **V≈1 can work** when market timing is right (Uber in ride-hailing)
2. **V≈1 can trap** when technology timeline is wrong (Cruise in AV)
3. **Believer investors accelerate commitment trap** by funding continuation of failing strategies

### The "More Capital" Trap
```
Problem signal appears
    ↓
Analyst response: "Pivot or cut losses"
    ↓
Believer response: "Fund more to reach breakthrough"
    ↓
Deeper commitment → Harder to pivot → Trap complete
```
