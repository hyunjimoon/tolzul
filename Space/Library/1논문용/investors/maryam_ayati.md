# Maryam Ayati / Supply Chain Blockchain Expert

## 📊 Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Expert / Advisor |
| **Style** | Analyst |
| **Sector** | Supply Chain, Logistics, Blockchain |
| **Focus** | Tokenizing supply chains |
| **Philosophy** | Tokenized Transparency |

## 🎯 Thesis Focus

### "Tokenizing Supply Chains"

Core belief: Blockchain technology enables unprecedented supply chain transparency, traceability, and efficiency.

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Supply chain opacity is costly**: Lack of transparency creates inefficiency and fraud
2. **Tokenization enables trust**: Immutable records reduce counterparty risk
3. **Logistics data has value**: Properly tokenized, supply chain data becomes tradeable asset

## 🚗 Transportation/Mobility Relevance

### Supply Chain × Transportation Nexus

| Application | Transportation Impact | Token Use Case |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Freight Tracking** | Real-time shipment visibility | Location/status tokens |
| **Fleet Management** | Vehicle utilization data | Asset utilization tokens |
| **Last-Mile Logistics** | Delivery verification | Proof-of-delivery tokens |
| **Cross-Border Trade** | Customs and compliance | Documentation tokens |

### Why Supply Chain Tokenization Matters for Mobility

1. **Asset tracking**: Every vehicle, container, package becomes traceable
2. **Payment automation**: Smart contracts enable instant freight payments
3. **Carbon accounting**: Tokenized emissions data for ESG compliance
4. **Multi-party coordination**: Trustless collaboration across logistics partners

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

### Promise Precision in Supply Chain Blockchain

| Promise Type | V Level | Typical Outcome |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| "Transform global trade" | 0.95 | Overpromise → pilot purgatory |
| "Reduce fraud in X corridor" | 0.6 | Specific, testable |
| "Save X% on documentation" | 0.4 | Highly specific ROI |

**Key insight**: Supply chain blockchain startups that succeeded used **lower V** (more specific promises):
- "Track diamonds from mine to store" (De Beers)
- "Verify organic certification" (Walmart produce)
- vs. "Revolutionize global trade" (failed ICOs)

## 💡 Key Themes

> **On supply chain opacity:**
> Modern supply chains involve dozens of parties across multiple jurisdictions—no single party has complete visibility.

> **On tokenization benefits:**
> When every handoff is recorded on an immutable ledger, trust becomes programmable rather than relational.

> **On data value:**
> Supply chain data is valuable but fragmented. Tokenization allows stakeholders to share data while retaining ownership.

## 📋 Blockchain Supply Chain Applications

| Use Case | Example | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Provenance** | Food traceability (IBM Food Trust) | Live |
| **Trade Finance** | Letter of credit automation (we.trade) | Evolving |
| **Freight** | Bill of lading digitization (TradeLens) | Discontinued* |
| **Pharma** | Drug authentication | Growing |

*TradeLens discontinuation is itself a Paper C case study—commitment trap?

## 🔄 Analyst Style Evidence

Maryam Ayati's focus on tokenization reflects **Analyst investor** preferences:
- Measurable metrics (tokens traced, cost saved)
- Technical specificity over grand vision
- ROI-focused evaluation
- Prefers V ≈ 0.4-0.6 (implementation-ready)

## ⚠️ Paper C Relevance: TradeLens as Commitment Trap

TradeLens (Maersk + IBM) as potential commitment trap case:
- Started with grand vision (V ≈ 0.95)
- Struggled with consortium coordination
- Shut down despite significant investment
- Lesson: Even specific tech needs network effects
