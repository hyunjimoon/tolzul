# Peter Thiel / Founders Fund

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Venture Capital |
| **Style** | Believer (contrarian) |
| **Sector** | Deep Tech, Defense, Space, AI |
| **Stage** | Seed - Series A |
| **AUM** | $11B+ (Founders Fund) |
| **Philosophy** | Zero to One |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

### "Zero to One" Framework

> "Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page will not build a search engine. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Zero to One** (not 1 to n): Creating something new vs. copying
2. **Successful businesses are built on secrets**: What valuable truth do few people agree with you on?
3. **Competition is for losers**: Seek monopoly, not competition
4. **You are not a lottery ticket**: Definite optimism beats indefinite optimism

## 🔬 Paper U/C Relevance

### Paper U: Believer Archetype
- **V≈1 investment preference**: Grand visions with unclear paths
- Core question: "What important truth do few people agree with you on?"
- This IS the Believer test - can the investor PROJECT their own vision?

### Paper C: Commitment Trap Insight

Thiel's framework explains WHY commitment traps form:

> **"Indefinite optimism"** = High μ but no clear plan
> 
> This leads to:
> - Iteration without direction
> - "Lean startup" without conviction
> - Eventually trapped in pivot cycles

**Contrast: Definite Optimism** = High μ WITH clear plan
- SpaceX: "We will go to Mars, here's the engineering path"
- Palantir: "We will transform government intelligence"

## 📋 Notable Investments

| Company | V Level | Thesis | Outcome |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Facebook** | 0.9 | "The social graph" | IPO, $1T+ |
| **SpaceX** | 1.0 | "Multi-planetary species" | $150B+ |
| **Palantir** | 0.9 | "Transform intelligence" | IPO |
| **Stripe** | 0.7 | "Internet payments infra" | $95B |
| **Anduril** | 0.9 | "Rebuild American defense" | $14B |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On secrets (key to avoiding murky middle):**
> "A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator."

> **On competition (why V≈0.5 fails):**
> "Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival."

> **On definite thinking:**
> "A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world."

## 🔄 Thiel's Two Failure Modes

| Mode | Description | Paper Connection |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Indefinite Pessimism** | No vision, no plan | N/A (doesn't start) |
| **Indefinite Optimism** | Vision but no plan → iterate forever | Paper C: Commitment Trap |
| **Definite Pessimism** | Plan but negative vision | N/A (rare in startups) |
| **Definite Optimism** | Vision + plan → success | Paper U: V≈1 success |
