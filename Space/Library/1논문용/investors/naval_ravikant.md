# Naval Ravikant / AngelList

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Angel Investor / Platform Builder |
| **Style** | Hybrid (Philosophy + Pattern) |
| **Sector** | Consumer, Crypto, SaaS |
| **Stage** | Angel / Seed |
| **Notable Creation** | AngelList (democratized angel investing) |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

### "The Evolutionary Angel"

> "Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Evolutionary angel**: Adapt investment thesis continuously
2. **On happiness I & II**: Founder mental state matters
3. **Specific knowledge**: Bet on unique, non-replicable skills
4. **Compounding**: Look for founders with compounding advantages

### Unique Investment Philosophy:

| Dimension | Naval's Approach |
|:---|:---|
| **Founder eval** | "What can this person do that no one else can?" |
| **Market timing** | "Be early to obvious" |
| **Network effects** | Essential for consumer plays |
| **Exit thinking** | "Build to last, but exit optionality" |

## 🔬 Paper U Relevance

### The "Specific Knowledge" Test for Vagueness

Naval's framework suggests WHY some V≈1 founders succeed:

```
Generic vision (V≈1, fails):    "Change the world" + replaceable founder
Specific knowledge (V≈1, works): "Change the world" + unique founder insight
```

**Paper U implication**: Vagueness works when founder has SPECIFIC path only they can see
- Elon Musk + rockets (physics first principles)
- Brian Chesky + design (RISD + hosting experience)

### Analyst vs Believer Reframe:

| Investor Question | Channel | Naval's View |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "Does this make sense?" | Analyst | Necessary but not sufficient |
| "Can this change everything?" | Believer | Required for massive outcomes |
| "Can ONLY this founder do it?" | Naval | The real question |

## 📋 Notable Investments

| Company | Specific Knowledge | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Twitter** | Jack's microblogging insight | IPO |
| **Uber** | Travis's aggression + timing | IPO |
| **Notion** | Ivan's tool-building obsession | $10B+ |
| **Figma** | Dylan's design tool insight | $20B (Adobe) |
| **Postmates** | Bastian's urban logistics | $2.65B (Uber) |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On founder selection:**
> "Specific knowledge cannot be trained. If society can train you, it can replace you."

> **On happiness (relevant to founder burnout/commitment trap):**
> "A happy founder makes better decisions. An anxious founder makes fear-based decisions."

> **On evolution:**
> "The best angels aren't static. They evolve their thesis faster than the market."

> **On crypto (Web3):**
> "Blockchains are a new computing platform, like the internet. Most people are underestimating the implications."
