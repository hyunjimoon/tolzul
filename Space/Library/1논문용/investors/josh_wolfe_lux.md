# Josh Wolfe / Lux Capital

## 📊 Investor Profile

| Dimension | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Deep Tech VC |
| **Style** | Hybrid (Analyst rigor + Believer vision) |
| **Sector** | Space, Defense, Biotech, Robotics, Materials |
| **Stage** | Seed - Series B |
| **AUM** | $4B+ |
| **Philosophy** | "Investing at the cutting edge" |

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

### "The Cutting Edge"

> "We back scientists and engineers commercializing hard science breakthroughs."

### Core Beliefs from Repository:

1. **Cutting edge investing**: Where science becomes product
2. **Cornell connection**: Academic → commercial translation
3. **Directional truth**: "Directionally correct beats precisely wrong"
4. **"What's working, what's not"**: Rigorous tracking of signals

### Unique Position: Analyst + Believer Hybrid

| Dimension | Analyst Element | Believer Element |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Due diligence** | Deep technical validation | Long-term vision acceptance |
| **Time horizon** | Track milestones | 10+ year patience |
| **Team** | Scientific credentials | Missionary founders |
| **Metrics** | Technical progress | Market transformation potential |

## 🔬 Paper U/C/N Relevance

### Paper U: The Hybrid Investor Problem

Josh Wolfe is rare - operates in BOTH channels:
- Uses **Analyst methods** (technical DD, scientific validation)
- For **Believer outcomes** (transformative technology)

**Implication**: Hybrid investors may be optimal for V≈0.6-0.8 companies that need BOTH validation AND vision.

### Paper C: Commitment Trap Early Warning

Lux's approach naturally avoids commitment trap:
```
Standard trap:  High μ → Believers → τ↑ → σ²↓ → Trapped
Lux approach:   High μ → Technical validation → Reality check → Adaptive
```

**Key mechanism**: Scientific method requires falsifiability
- "What evidence would disprove this thesis?"
- Built-in doubt maintenance

### Paper N: Portfolio as Option Portfolio

Lux explicitly manages portfolio as options:
- Each investment = option on breakthrough
- Some expire worthless (expected)
- Winners pay for portfolio
- Pure strategy per company, diversified portfolio

## 📋 Notable Investments

| Company | Sector | V Level | Technical Rigor |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Anduril** | Defense | 0.9 | High (Luckey + Eng team) |
| **Planet Labs** | Space/EO | 0.4 | Very High (satellite specs) |
| **Shapeways** | 3D Print | 0.5 | High (materials science) |
| **Desktop Metal** | 3D Print | 0.6 | High (MIT tech) |
| **Hadrian** | Manufacturing | 0.7 | High (automation specs) |

## 💡 Key Quotes for Thesis

> **On cutting edge timing:**
> "You want to be early, not first. First means you're funding the science experiment. Early means you're funding the commercialization."

> **On directional correctness:**
> "I'd rather be directionally right than precisely wrong. The specific path matters less than whether you're heading toward value creation."

> **On portfolio management:**
> "Our portfolio is a call option on the future. Some will expire worthless, but the ones that work will define new industries."

## 🔄 Wolfe's "What's Working" Framework

Lux publicly tracks:
- Technologies advancing/stalling
- Market adoption signals
- Regulatory developments
- Competitive landscape changes

**Paper C implication**: This public tracking = forced σ² maintenance
- Can't ignore negative signals
- Institutionalized doubt
