# Control versus Execution: Endogenous Appropriability and Entrepreneurial Strategy

## Summary
This paper argues that appropriability regimes are **endogenous** to entrepreneurial choice rather than exogenous environmental factors. Entrepreneurs face a strategic choice between **Control** (securing formal IP protection) and **Execution** (rapid market entry with learning). These are **strategic substitutes**—choosing one path inherently sacrifices benefits of the other. Under Rosenbergian uncertainty (economic uncertainty after successful invention), near-term idiosyncratic factors (founder identity, resources, preferences) drive the choice rather than long-term environmental conditions.

## Research Question
How does Rosenbergian uncertainty reshape the strategic choice of appropriability regime for start-up innovators?

## Key Concepts

### Control Strategy
Investment in activities designed to **prevent future competition**: patents, trade secrets, non-competes, regulatory barriers. Costs are upfront, involves delays in market entry, but offers a "quiet life" once secured.

### Execution Strategy  
Investment in capabilities to **outpace competition**: early market entry, customer learning, iterative experimentation. Allows "get ahead, stay ahead" through nurtured experience and dynamic capabilities.

### Rosenbergian Uncertainty
"Uncertainties of a specifically economic nature" that arise **after** successful invention—uncertainty about market applications, customer needs, cost structures, and competitive dynamics. Makes it impossible to rank alternative commercialization paths in advance.

### Strategic Substitutes
Control and Execution represent alternative paths to the **same objective** (securing future rents). Because entrepreneurs have limited resources and cannot coherently pursue both paths simultaneously, they must choose one, inherently sacrificing benefits of the other.

## Main Results

### Theoretical Framework
Mathematical model demonstrates:
$$V_C = \frac{\delta^t}{1-\delta}\alpha_C v - c \quad \text{(Control payoff)}$$
$$V_E = \frac{1}{1-\delta}(\alpha_E v - e) \quad \text{(Execution payoff)}$$

Control preferred when: $(\delta^t \alpha_C - \alpha_E)v > (1-\delta)c - e$

Key insight: Even **costless** IP protection may be rejected if learning advantages from execution are sufficiently high.

### Empirical Finding: Paper-Startup Pairs (N=103)
| Measure | Student-led | Faculty-led | Difference |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Patent filing rate | 32% | 70% | -38 pp*** |
| Time paper→founding | 14 months | 45 months | -31 months*** |
| Time paper→funding | 29 months | 68 months | -39 months*** |
| Time paper→product | 31 months | 82 months | -51 months*** |

Student-led ventures: lower patenting, faster commercialization (execution-oriented)
Faculty-led ventures: higher patenting, slower milestones (control-oriented)

### Interaction Effect
Student-led ventures that **do** patent incur additional 27-month delay relative to those that don't—consistent with strategic trade-off between control and execution.

## Critical Insights

### For Flexibility-Commitment Framework
This paper provides **direct evidence** that Control and Execution are strategic substitutes. Key implications:
- Commitment to Control **forecloses** Execution benefits (learning, speed, customer feedback)
- Under uncertainty, **near-term factors dominate** choice (not long-term optimization)
- Founder identity shapes appropriability regime—not just environmental factors

### Bell vs. Western Union Case
Bell (Control): Focused on patents, delayed market entry, ultimately won IP rights
Western Union (Execution): Leveraged complementary assets, rapid scaling, established market presence
Result: 1879 Patent Agreement gave WU 40% equity—reflecting that WU had "won" market position while Bell "won" control

## Methodology

**Approach**: Natural experiment using academic paper-startup pairs
**Sample**: 103 startups in electrical engineering/CS (2007-2014) where paper was co-authored by faculty and student
**Identification**: Same "idea" (paper), different founder identity (student vs. faculty)
**Data**: CrunchBase, USPTO, Google Scholar, Internet Wayback Machine

**Supports dissertation**:
- **P1**: Control/Execution substitutability explains U-shaped survival (early flexibility vs. later commitment)
- **P2**: Choosing Control too early = potential competency trap (lose learning benefits)
- **Strategic ambiguity**: Value proposition vagueness may be execution-oriented strategy

## Application to Dissertation

### Control vs. Execution → Flexibility vs. Commitment
| Control Strategy | Execution Strategy |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Commitment to IP | Flexibility in pivoting |
| Delayed entry | Early market learning |
| "Quiet life" protection | Continuous competition |
| Upfront costs | Ongoing costs |

### Implications for Strategic Ambiguity Hypothesis
- **Vague value propositions** may signal execution-oriented strategy
- Founders prioritizing **customer learning** over **investor signaling** may use ambiguity
- Discoverer-identity founders (like students) may prefer strategic ambiguity → faster pivoting

### Key Mechanism: Learning Forfeiture
Under Control: "founders cannot gain from learning the value of the innovation"
Under Execution: "learning the value of execution allows the entrepreneur to forestall additional costs should that value turn out to be low"

This directly supports the **P3 hypothesis**: Maintaining multiple options (through strategic ambiguity) preserves learning opportunities that commitment forecloses.

## 📚 Must Read

1. **Rosenberg (1994)** - *Exploring the Black Box* - Source of "Rosenbergian uncertainty" concept
2. **Teece (1986)** - *Profiting from Innovation* - Foundation of appropriability regime analysis
3. **Shane (2000)** - Technology commercialization paths vary by founder knowledge
4. **Gruber et al. (2013)** - Founders identifying multiple market opportunities achieve higher performance

## For Your Paper

**Directly applicable**: Use Control/Execution framework to operationalize Flexibility/Commitment trade-off in entrepreneurship

**Hypothesis generation**: 
- H: Founders with Discoverer identity (vs. Revolutionary) are more likely to use strategic ambiguity in value propositions
- H: Early Control investment correlates with lower pivoting rate (competency trap mechanism)

**Empirical strategy**: Paper-startup pairs methodology could be adapted to study how value proposition specificity varies by founder background
