# Quibi: The $1.75B Murky Middle Disaster

## 📊 Paper U Classification

| Dimension | Value | Interpretation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vagueness (V)** | ≈ 0.5 | "Premium mobile content" - neither TikTok nor Netflix |
| **Analyst Appeal** | ❌ Low | "User behavior prediction has no empirical basis" |
| **Believer Appeal** | ❌ Low | "10-minute episodes" = vision-constrained, not revolutionary |
| **Outcome** | Shutdown (2020) | 6 months after launch |

## 🎯 Why Murky Middle Killed Quibi

### Analyst Channel Failure
```
Analyst Question: "Does this plan make sense?"
Quibi Answer: "People will watch premium content in 10-min chunks while commuting"
Analyst Response: "What data supports this user behavior assumption?"
Quibi: "We have Jeffrey Katzenberg's intuition..."
→ VERIFICATION FAILED (no empirical evidence)
```

### Believer Channel Failure
```
Believer Question: "Could this change the world?"
Quibi Answer: "We're making Hollywood-quality content for mobile"
Believer Response: "So... a smaller Netflix? TikTok is free and endless..."
Quibi: "We're different! We have Turnstyle technology!"
→ PROJECTION SPACE TOO NARROW (format constraint kills vision)
```

### The Dual Threshold Trap

```
                    Verifiability
                         ↑
                    High │  [Netflix: "X subscribers, Y% retention, Z growth"]
                         │
                         │      ┌────────────┐
                    Mid  │      │   QUIBI    │ ← STUCK HERE
                         │      │  V ≈ 0.5   │
                         │      └────────────┘
                         │
                    Low  │  [TikTok: "Infinite scroll, anyone can be a creator"]
                         └────────────────────────→ Projectability
                              Low            High
```

## 📋 Key Mistakes Through Paper U Lens

### 1. Format Constraint Destroyed Both Channels

| Constraint | Analyst Impact | Believer Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **10-minute episodes** | Can't verify optimal length | Can't project "binge culture" |
| **Mobile-only** | No living room data exists | Excludes TV experience dreams |
| **Premium pricing ($5-8/mo)** | No price elasticity tested | Competes with free TikTok |

### 2. Neither Fish Nor Fowl

```python
quibi_positioning = {
    "vs_netflix": "Shorter, but why pay twice?",
    "vs_youtube": "Premium, but YouTube has premium too",
    "vs_tiktok": "Scripted, but less viral/social",
    "vs_podcasts": "Visual, but can't multitask",
    
    "result": "No clear winning comparison"
}
```

### 3. The COVID Counterfactual Trap

**Popular narrative:** "COVID killed Quibi (no commuting)"

**Paper U analysis:** COVID was irrelevant. The murky middle problem existed pre-pandemic:
- At home → Netflix/Disney+ better (bigger screen)
- Commuting → TikTok/YouTube better (free, social)
- Waiting rooms → Same as commuting

## 🔄 What Would Pure Strategy Look Like?

### Option A: Pure Analyst (V ≈ 0)
```
"We are a mobile-first Netflix with 3x higher engagement per minute.
Here's our A/B test data from 10,000 beta users showing:
- 47% complete rate vs. 23% industry average
- $12 CAC vs. $45 Netflix"
→ Verifiable claims, let Analysts decide
```

### Option B: Pure Believer (V ≈ 1)
```
"We're building the future of storytelling where every moment matters.
What if the best creators could reach you in the 5 minutes between meetings?
Join us to reimagine entertainment."
→ Wide projection space, let Believers dream
```
