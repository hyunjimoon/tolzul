# 🏭 Autonomous Vehicles (AV)

## 📊 Suitability Score: 9/10

### 1. Hypothesis Fit (이론적 적합성)
> **Core Question**: Does this industry have high uncertainty (H1 cost) and high pivot cost (H2 benefit)?

- **Uncertainty (H1)**: **High**
    - *Reason*: Level 4/5 timeline is unknown. Regulatory landscape is shifting.
- **Pivot Cost (H2)**: **High**
    - *Reason*: Heavy hardware (LiDAR, Sensors), fleet operations, physical testing. Hard to pivot from "Robotaxi" to "Trucking" without massive cost.
- **Time Horizon**: **Long**
    - *Series A to B*: ~24-36 months (Longer than SaaS)

### 2. 4-Dimension Profile (Week 4 Criteria)
| Dimension | Ambiguity Source | Example Keywords |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📡 Tech** | Sensor fusion, Edge cases | LiDAR, SLAM, Level 4, Perception |
| **🎯 Customer** | B2C (Taxi) vs B2B (Logistics) | Mobility-as-a-Service, Last-mile |
| **⚔️ Comp** | Tech Giants vs Startups | Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Aurora |
| **👥 Org** | AI Researchers + Auto Engineers | CMU, Stanford, DARPA Challenge |

### 3. Data Feasibility (데이터 가능성)
- **Pitchbook Coverage**: **High** (Major investment boom 2015-2020)
- **T=1 Text Availability**: **High** (Many public demos, whitepapers, safety reports)
- **Era Pair Candidate**: vs **3D Printing** (Both Hardware-heavy, Hype cycles)

### 📝 Verdict
- [x] **Primary Target** (Main Analysis)
- [ ] **Control Group** (Comparison)
- [ ] **Discard** (Too niche/No data)

---
**Notes**:
- Perfect for H2 (Real Option).
- "Vague promises" about L5 autonomy were rampant.
- Those who kept options open (platform approach) vs specific (Robotaxi only) might show different survival rates.
