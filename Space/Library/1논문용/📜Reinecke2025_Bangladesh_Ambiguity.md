# 📜 From Constructive Ambiguity to Escalating Commitment: Bangladesh Accord

## Metadata
- **Authors**: Juliane Reinecke, Jimmy Donaghey

- **Journal**: Administrative Science Quarterly
- **Volume**: 70
- **Pages**: 733–771
- **Type**: Empirical-Longitudinal

## Key Concepts
- **Constructive Ambiguity**: Initial vagueness that enables coalition formation
- **Escalating Commitment**: How initial ambiguity leads to increasing rigidity
- **Transnational Institutions**: Collective action across national boundaries
- **Evolution**: Temporal dynamics from flexibility to lock-in

## Core Argument
The Bangladesh Accord demonstrates how constructive ambiguity (which enabled diverse stakeholders to agree initially) can evolve into escalating commitment (where parties become locked into increasingly rigid interpretations). This temporal progression from flexibility to constraint reveals the lifecycle of strategic ambiguity.

## Relevance to My Research
- **Temporal Dynamics**: DIRECTLY addresses H1 → H2 transition (early vs. late effects)
- **Mechanism**: Shows HOW low τ transforms from asset to liability over time
- **Empirical Strategy**: Longitudinal approach to studying promise precision evolution

## Connection to OIL Framework
This paper is CRITICAL for understanding τ DYNAMICS:

**Phase 1 - Constructive Ambiguity** (t=0 to t₁):
- Low τ enables stakeholder agreement
- Maps to H1: vague promises reduce early certainty → lower funding
- But enable coalition formation

**Phase 2 - Escalating Commitment** (t₁ to t₂):
- Low τ becomes problematic as parties interpret differently
- Maps to need for τ to INCREASE over time
- Failure to increase τ → lock-in and rigidity

**Key insight for OIL**:
τ* is not STATIC, it's a TRAJECTORY:
- τ*(t) increases with venture age
- Optimal τ path: Low → Medium → High
- Deviation from path (staying low OR jumping high too fast) → failure

**Implication for empirical model**:
Instead of:
- H1: τ → early funding (static)
- H2: τ → later success (static)

Should be:
- H1: τ₀ → early funding
- H2: Δτ (change in precision) → later success
- H3: (τ₀, Δτ) interaction → venture survival

**This is a MAJOR refinement**: I need to measure precision TRAJECTORY, not just initial level.
