abstract: Entrepreneurial success depends on reducing uncertainty about the quality of ideas and selecting effective strategies to bring the idea to market. Mentorship plays a critical role in this process. In this paper, I examine how mentorship improves entrepreneurial outcomes within the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), a global mentorship-driven startup accelerator, through two channels: the direct effect of improving startup quality and the screening effect of identifying high-quality startups. Using mentorship interaction data from CDL, I apply machine learning algorithms to generate quantifiable measures of mentors’ advice. I propose and estimate a structural model of mentorship, where the dynamics of quality accumulation are influenced by both the direct effect of mentors’ advice and the screening effect from mentors’ learning. I find that mentorship generates value through both direct and screening effects, with significant spillovers of quality signals between mentors. This model enables a counterfactual analysis, quantifying the value added by mentors when they actively shape the strategic direction of startups, compared to a more passive role where they support the execution of the entrepreneurs’ original plans. The counterfactual analysis shows that entrepreneurs benefit from mentors’ strategic guidance, with significant heterogeneity across sectors. In emerging sectors like quantum, mentors’ strategic input has minimal impact, especially early on, suggesting that a more passive mentorship approach may be more beneficial. In these sectors, screening gains grow over time as mentors accumulate information and provide guidance that better reflects the true quality of the startups. These results offer important managerial implications for the design of intermediaries, such as accelerators that provide mentorship, suggesting that guidance approaches should be tailored to the specific needs and developmental stages of each sector.
