# Incentives and Creativity: Evidence from the Academic Life Sciences

## Summary
Examines whether incentive systems designed to promote exploration (HHMI) produce different innovation outcomes than systems designed for exploitation (NIH R01). Using a synthetic control group of comparable scientists, finds that HHMI scientists produce more highly-cited work and greater diversity in research topics, consistent with the theory that tolerating early failure and rewarding long-term success promotes exploration.

## Research Question
Do incentive structures that emphasize long-term rewards and tolerance for failure (exploration) produce different innovation outcomes compared to short-term project-based incentives (exploitation)?

## Key Concepts

### Exploration vs Exploitation Trade-off
**Exploration**: Trying new, risky approaches with uncertain payoffs but high potential
**Exploitation**: Refining existing approaches with more predictable outcomes

### HHMI vs NIH R01 Incentive Structures

**HHMI Program:**
- Funds "people, not projects" 
- 5-year funding cycles
- First review is lax (did you use the freedom?)
- Encourages boundary-pushing research
- Matches [[📜manso11_motivating]] prescription for exploration

**NIH R01 Grants:**
- Fund specific projects
- 3-5 year cycles with uncertain renewal
- First review is strict
- Incentivizes incremental, safe publications

## Main Results

### Productivity Differences
HHMI scientists show significantly higher citation rates post-appointment compared to synthetic controls, with the effect emerging after 1994 (treatment year).

### Fat-Tail Distribution
HHMI scientists produce more papers in both top 5% (hits) and bottom tails (failures) of citation distribution, consistent with greater risk-taking.

### Diversity of Research
HHMI scientists branch into new research areas more frequently, measured by:
- Novel keyword combinations
- Entry into new subfields  
- Broader citation patterns

### Team Composition
No detectable difference in team size or collaboration patterns, suggesting the effect operates through project selection rather than resources.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: The paper demonstrates that incentive design fundamentally shapes the innovation process itself - not just how much innovation occurs, but what type. This has profound implications for research funding policy.

### Measurement of Creativity
Paper uses both outcome-based measures (citation tails) and process-based measures (branching out/recombination) to capture creativity.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Synthetic control group design
**Data**: 
- HHMI award winners (treatment)
- Early-career fellowship winners with NIH grants (controls)
- Publication and citation data from Web of Science

**Analysis**: 
- Difference-in-differences comparing pre/post award periods
- Matched controls ensure similar ex-ante characteristics
- Multiple measures of research output and direction

**Innovation**: Uses multiple signals to construct comparable control group, including:
- Early-career awards (signal quality)
- Publication trajectories pre-award
- Institutional affiliations

## Connections

**Builds on**:
- [[📜manso11_motivating]] - Theoretical foundation for exploration incentives
- [[📜holmstrom89_agency]] - Multi-task agency theory

**Relates to**:
- [[📜azoulay21_grant(funding)]] - Design of grant systems
- [[📜stern04_pay(scientists)]] - Scientist preferences

**Influences**:
- Design of NIH Pioneer Awards
- Academic funding reform discussions

## Class Discussion

### Key Points
- Challenge of measuring creativity - use both tails and process
- Importance of freedom/autonomy in research direction
- Role of failure tolerance in high-risk research

### Open Questions
1. What are the welfare implications of shifting more funding to exploration-style programs?
2. How do these effects vary by career stage and field?
3. Can exploitation-style systems incorporate failure tolerance?

## Application to Course

Connects to [[🗺️(15357)]] framework:
- Ideas production function: A' = f(L_A, K_A, A; Z_A, δ)
- Z_A: Incentive design shapes type and direction of research
- δ: Different incentive structures may change the form of the production function itself
