# Matthew: Effect or Fable?

## Research Question
Does a shock to a producer's **status** (independent of quality) cause others to change their perceptions of the quality of that producer's products?

## Background: The Matthew Effect

**Merton (1968)** observed:
> "Eminent scientists get disproportionately great credit for their contributions while relatively unknown scientists tend to get disproportionately little credit for comparable contributions"

### Original Observations
- Famous scientist on paper → junior researchers get less credit
- In simultaneous discoveries → well-known scientist gets prime recognition
- Later success retroactively affects appraisals of earlier collaboration

## Research Design

### The Natural Experiment
- **Treatment**: Papers written **before** scientist wins major award
- **Control**: Matched papers from scientists who never win award
- **Outcome**: Citation rates before vs. after award

### Key Innovation: Within-Paper Analysis
Eliminates quality confounds by:
1. Analyzing only **pre-award papers**
2. Comparing same paper's citations before/after award
3. Matching on: publication year, journal, author characteristics

### Matching Strategy
Control papers matched on:
- Same publication year (controls for citation accumulation time)
- Same journal (proxy for quality)
- Author characteristics making them "award-eligible"

## Main Results

### Effect Size
- **Small but positive** post-appointment citation boost
- Effect is **short-lived** (not persistent)
- Much smaller than Merton's accounts suggested

### Heterogeneous Effects

**Stronger Matthew Effect when:**
1. ✅ **High uncertainty** about article quality
2. ✅ **Low initial status** of prize winner (at time of award)

**Weaker Matthew Effect when:**
- Quality signals already strong
- Author already well-established

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Empirical strategy is the star here**: 
> - Put in enormous work identifying and assembling data
> - Make identification argument natural
> - Only require straightforward econometrics
> - First-order: internal validity; Second-order: external validity

### Methodological Contribution

**Challenge**: Disentangle status from resources
- Status boost → more funding, better students, more resources
- Resources → better future work → more citations

**Solution**: Focus on **pre-award papers only**
- Can't affect resources used to write those papers
- Isolates pure status effect on perception

### What's NOT Measured
This design carefully **does not** estimate:
- Resource effects of status (deliberately excluded)
- Effects on future productivity
- Long-run career impacts

## Pierre's Research Philosophy

### Data Assembly First
1. Invest heavily in data identification and assembly
2. Make identification natural (not clever)  
3. Use straightforward econometrics
4. Internal validity >> External validity (initially)

### The Azoulay Approach
> "Put in large amount of work identifying and assembling the data so that the identification argument is natural and only requires straightforward econometrics."

## Connections

**Builds on**:
- [[📜merton68_matthew(effect)]] - Original Matthew effect theory
- [[📜merton57_priority(discovery)]] - Scientific priority disputes

**Relates to**:
- [[📜stern04_pay(scientists)]] - Scientists' preferences
- [[📜murray16_mice(academics)]] - Openness and innovation
- [[📜azoulay19_funeral(science)]] - Superstar extinction effects

**Methodology influences**:
- Natural experiments in innovation research
- Matching estimators for status effects

## Implications

### For Science Policy
- Status does matter, but less than anecdotes suggest
- Most important for:
  - Early-career researchers
  - Uncertain-quality work
  
### For Merton's Norms
Status **moderately** violates universalism:
- "Claims to truth evaluated by universal criteria"
- In practice: identity matters, but not as much as feared

### For Research Design
- Power of within-unit comparisons
- Value of patient data assembly
- Importance of clear counterfactuals

## Class Discussion

### The Big Picture
Matthew effect exists but is:
- ❌ NOT as large as feared
- ✅ Concentrated in specific contexts
- ✅ Short-lived
- ✅ Heterogeneous

### Open Questions
1. What about **negative** status shocks?
2. Do effects accumulate over careers?
3. How does this interact with actual quality improvements?

## Application to Course Themes

Relates to **Open Science Institution**:
- How rewards shape scientific behavior
- Trade-offs between open science and appropriability  
- Role of status in scientific labor markets

Connects to [[🗺️(15357)]] framework:
- $A' = f(L_A, K_A, A; Z_A, \delta)$
- Status as part of institutional environment ($Z_A$)
- Affects **who contributes** to knowledge production ($L_A$)

*"The results show that status effects do exist but may be smaller than one might expect."*
