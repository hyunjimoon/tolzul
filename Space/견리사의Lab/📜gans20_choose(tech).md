Abstract. A central premise of research in the strategic management of innovation is that start-ups are able to leverage emerging technological trajectories as a source of competitive advantage. But, if the potential for a technology is given by the fundamental character of a given technological trajectory, then why does entrepreneurial strategy matter? Or, put another way, if the evolution of technology is largely shaped by the strategic choices entrepreneurs make, then why do technological trajectories exhibit systematic patterns such as the technology S-curve? Taking a choice-based perspective, this paper illuminates the choices confronting a start-up choosing their technology by resolving the paradox of the technology S-curve through a reformulation of the foundations of the technology S-curve. Speciﬁcally, we reconceptualize the technology S-curve not as a technological given but as an envelope of potential outcomes reﬂecting differing strategic choices by the entrepreneur in exploration versus exploitation. Taking this lens, we are able to clarify the role of technological uncertainty on start-up strategy, the impact of constraints on technological evolution, and how technology choice is shaped by the possibility of imitation. Our ﬁndings suggest that staged exploration may stall innovation as a result of the replacement effect, increasing the strategic importance of commitment.

> **start-ups can fall victim to a similar dynamic"**: The paper shows that start-ups can experience a replacement effect similar to incumbents, but through a different mechanism. While incumbents resist innovation because new products might cannibalize existing successful products (Arrow's classic replacement effect), start-ups face a parallel problem:When a start-up achieves early success with a limited approach to a technology (the "red" S-curve), they become reluctant to invest in deeper exploration of the same technology because: 1) They've already achieved some market success, 2) Further exploration would require significant resources, 3) The successful product could be cannibalized by their own improved version 4) The immediate benefits of continuing with their current approach are more certain

This section-by-section analysis reveals how the paper builds from identifying a paradox in S-curve theory to developing a new choice-based framework that better explains both firm and industry-level patterns. The emojis highlight the interplay between individual decisions (🧍‍♀️), environmental constraints (🌏), process dynamics (🧭), and conceptual frameworks (🗺️) throughout the argument.


- staged exploration may stall innovation as a result of the re- placement effect, increasing the strategic importance of commitment

- insight of Foster (1986) was to bring together these two lines of research into a single framework that simultaneously offered structured predictions about the evolution of technology while also offering guidance into technology management.
- focus on learning is the microfoundation for the prediction that the early stages of a technological trajectory demonstrate a relatively ﬂat performance-effort proﬁle)
- paradigmatic shift in thinking ushered in by their work is grounded in their ability to offer concrete frameworks linking the emergence of speciﬁc types of technological trajectories to speciﬁc predictions regarding competitive dynamics
- relationship between a more exploration-oriented versus exploitation-oriented approach and competitive advantage is ambiguous.
- accessing the resources required to achieve the long-term home run often necessitates (or highly incentivizes) partially resolving the uncertainty of the long-term home run through 'base hits.'
- a strategic choice as to whether to prioritize maximal learning through exploration or the speed of the transition toward exploitation.

- a start-up that prioritized exploitation at a relatively early stage could simply revert back to a more exploratory mode (perhaps resulting in an ascending wave pattern in which a start-up pursuing the red trajectory could then transition back to the blue trajectory as it exhausts the value of its limited early-stage learning).
- trade-off is made even more salient by the fact that the strategic management of an emerging technological trajectory is but one of several interdependent choices made by start-up innovators, with the combination resulting in both trade-offs and limited commitments 
- “When we started the insulin project, DNA synthesis was not the risky part”
- Each of these are the option value of continuing exploration after exploitation
- where there is no imitation, the optimal T’ is increasing in T, the initial level of exploration. That is, the higher the S-curve potential reached in the initial round of exploration, the higher is the target for an S-curve in subsequent rounds
- However, when technical and institutional factors allow for the establishment of a dominant design, there is a signiﬁcant uptick in the realized performance of the technology (expanding demand),
- industry ferment is characterized by broad experimentation and competing paths (Clark 1985), it relies on a degree of common perception, access, and learning across entrants (both entrepreneurs and existing ﬁrms) engaging with the emerging trajectory.
