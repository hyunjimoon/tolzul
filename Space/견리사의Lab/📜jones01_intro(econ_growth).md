# Introduction to Economic Growth

## Summary
Foundational text on economic growth theory, covering both Solow model and endogenous growth models. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on technology and ideas as drivers of growth.

## Key Concepts

### Production Function
- In Cobb-Douglas: $Y = K^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$ 
- With technology: $y = k^{\alpha}$ (per capita terms)

### Ideas-Based Growth
- **A** represents technology/ideas stock
- Ideas are nonrivalrous: use by one doesn't preclude use by another
- Capital goods have increasing returns to scale due to ideas

## Critical Insights

> **Why this matters**: Traditional Solow model couldn't explain sustained per capita growth. Ideas-based models solve this by recognizing ideas as distinct from traditional factors of production.

### Three Key Facts to Explain:
1. Real rate of return r doesn't trend
2. Physical capital share of income (rK/Y) ≈ 1/3, constant
3. K/Y constant over time → implies sustained growth requires technology

### The Ideas Production Function
$$A' = \delta A^{\phi}L_A^{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $A'$: flow of new ideas
- $\delta$: research productivity parameter  
- $\phi$: effect of existing ideas (φ>0: standing on shoulders, φ<0: fishing out)
- $L_A$: researchers
- $\lambda$: duplication parameter

- [[1🐢Innovation]] field research

## Class Discussion Notes

From [[23_15357]]:
- **Critical**: Production function for ideas is basis for entire course
- Nonrivalrous nature of ideas → increasing returns to scale
- Larger population of researchers → exponential growth in ideas

## Questions for Further Research
- What determines φ? Is it positive (standing on shoulders) or negative (fishing out)?
- How do institutions affect δ?
- What's the optimal allocation of labor between production and research?

*"Ideas are different from most goods analyzed in economics in that they are nonrivalrous"*
