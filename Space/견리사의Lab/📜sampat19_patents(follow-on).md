# How Do Patents Affect Follow-on Innovation? Evidence from the Human Genome

## Summary
Uses examiner leniency as instrument to estimate causal effect of gene patents on follow-on research. Finds no significant impact on publications, clinical trials, or diagnostic test development. Patent holders tolerate basic research infringement; licensing markets function for commercial development. Challenges concerns about patents blocking cumulative innovation.

## Research Question
Do patents on foundational discoveries (human genes) hinder follow-on scientific research and commercial development?

## Key Concepts

### Examiner Leniency IV
Random assignment of patent applications to examiners with varying historical grant rates. Provides exogenous variation in patent approval.

### Measures of Follow-on Innovation
- Scientific publications mentioning gene
- Clinical trials using gene
- Diagnostic tests based on gene

## Main Results

### No Detectable Effect
No significant difference in follow-on innovation between genes with granted vs rejected patents (both naive and IV estimates).

### Mechanism
For discoveries that are "effectively open access": Patent holders tolerate infringement by basic researchers; licensing markets operate efficiently for commercial applications.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: Patents on upstream discoveries don't necessarily block downstream innovation - social norms and licensing markets can overcome potential hold-up problems.

## Methodology

**Approach**: IV estimation using examiner leniency
**Data**: Gene patent applications; publication/clinical trial/diagnostic test data matched to genes
**Analysis**: 2SLS with examiner fixed effects as instrument for patent grant

## Connections

**Builds on**:
- [[📜murray16_mice(academics)]] - Openness and innovation

**Relates to**:
- [[📜scotchmer91_shoulders(giants)]] - Cumulative innovation theory
- [[📜moser13_patents(history)]] - Patent effects on innovation

**Influences**:
- Gene patent policy debates
- Myriad Genetics Supreme Court case

## Application to Course

Connects to [[🗺️(15357)]] framework:
- Cumulative aspect of ideas production: A enters production function
- Patents need not block cumulativeness if institutions adapt
