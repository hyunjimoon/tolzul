# 6.S090 Probabilistic Computing

> *"How do we build AI systems that reason about uncertainty?"*

Probabilistic Computing explores how to build intelligent systems using probabilistic programming, Bayesian inference, and automated reasoning.

## 🎯 Key Topics
- Probabilistic programming languages (Gen.jl)
- Bayesian inference algorithms (MCMC, SMC)
- Generative models and simulation
- Automated model formalization
- AI for scientific discovery

## 🔗 Battlefield: 🐅 CompBayes
Core training in Bayesian methods, uncertainty quantification, and computational inference for decision-making.
