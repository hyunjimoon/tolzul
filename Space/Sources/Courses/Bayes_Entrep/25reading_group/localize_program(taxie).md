# TAXIE Business Strategy Framework

applying [[üöïtaxie]]

|Section|Purpose|Key Components|Core Functions|Implementation Details|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. üó∫Ô∏è Business Domain Representation|Models TAXIE's business environment and market position|BusinessPose, BusinessControl, MarketSpace, TaxieStartupEnvironment|distance_to_market_segment(), physical_step(), integrate_business_path()|BusinessPose tracks position (x=range, y=earnings) and heading (strategic direction); MarketSpace defines market boundaries with (150-300 miles range, 0‚àí3000earningsadvantage)andcompetitorregions(Hertzfleetat220‚àí260miles,0-3000 earnings advantage) and competitor regions (Hertz fleet at 220-260 miles, 0‚àí3000earningsadvantage)andcompetitorregions(Hertzfleetat220‚àí260miles,1400-1800); Environment integrates the physics of business movement with constraints|
|2. üß† Probabilistic Models|Provides generative models for business strategy|Sensor models, step models, path models, prior distributions|sensor_model_one(), step_model(), full_model(), uniform_pose_prior(), localized_prior()|Sensor model uses genjax.normal with market distance + noise; Step model implements mv_normal_diag for uncertain movement; Full model combines steps with sensors; Priors include uniform (whole market), mixture (market segments), and localized (around specific position)|
|3. üîÑ Inference Methods|Implements algorithms for reasoning under uncertainty|Noisy sensing, importance resampling, SIS with rejuvenation, grid-based rejuvenation|noisy_sensor(), importance_resample(), SISwithRejuvenation class, grid_fwd_proposal(), grid_bwd_proposal()|SIS scan function tracks particles through steps; Grid rejuvenation uses SMCP3 with forwards/backwards proposals; Make grid functions create exploration spaces; Grid margin set to 0.5 and resolution to 5|
|4. üïπÔ∏è Visualization and Dashboard|Creates interactive exploration tools|Market visualization, path plots, interactive widgets, dashboard|plot_market_space(), plot_path_with_confidence(), pose_widget(), camera_widget(), taxie_dashboard()|Market visualization uses colored regions for competitors; Path plots show business trajectory with confidence intervals; Dashboard combines Market Sensing tab (for exploration) and Business Path tab (for analysis); Pose widgets enable dragging to explore market positions|
|5. üìä Business Insights|Extracts actionable recommendations|Analysis functions, strategy interpretation, metrics calculation, insight generation|analyze_taxie_business_strategy(), interpret_business_strategy(), taxie_business_insights()|Analyzes two scenarios: confident (low noise) vs uncertain (high noise); Calculates key metrics: error from optimal position, position variance, probability of profitability (reaching 260+ miles range with $1500+ earnings), competitor collision risk; Final recommendation to shut down operations based on high maintenance costs and Hertz's competitive advantage|
