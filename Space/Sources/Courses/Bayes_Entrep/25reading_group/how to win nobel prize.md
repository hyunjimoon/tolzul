surround yourself with bright ppl who will tolerate you

oliver har, roger 

paul and bengt are same advisor
1. simplify - uncertainty in utility
2. asking question is painful - answering - reassure them it's painful, 
3. journey - don't end up where you aim (rome, find - learn paul milgram; aiming for common agency, important thing is multi taking. - brave move)

peter, daron, dummiest ppl in the room 

most of bengt paper are contrarian - answer is not what they think it is - energized

trading no idea what it represented - how likely is it 

the whole idea being opaque (not )

value of information - 
something we thought was one way but the other way - stick to question (dont believe the answer)

## esther duflo

student (1999)
pioneer what works and oesn't in development - jpal
16mil ppl

2019
dedicated to mit (ddp program - all over the world masters to study economics, serving rethink undergraduate) 
dedicated to our institution

you should not do math - they do 

less about your own research but influence it had on profession as a whole 

physics and chemistry are same

with the work of other ppl, fundamental building up institution of instituion an

sub parameterics ; not very interesting ideology - russia influence in the world

seize this tool to make different 
driving force of work, learn a lot not to influence 

josh angrist and daron was esther's adviso??

1. help ppl - do what they want to do more effectively (don't tell what to do)
2. create data
⭐️help other ppl to do the same work - movement to run thi sproject thousands of ppl

thousand ppl not distributed uniformly (cambodia)
ddep program - make available online class for more ppl

policy maker, researcher
obliterated work - make total of the number of project that to run better ; establish a ongoing without JPAL

⭐️have a vision

## abhijit
economic theorist

getting a job at mit, surround yourself with brillant student and peer (peter mentor), 

each of this ppl - 
ok to be wrong - important to be stubborn; don't give it up easily even if it's wrong

first rct, slam dunk - increase the number of students for student - learning goes up, 
found nothnig - 

one of the five things - assumption was wrong - willing to go out on your limb, stick to your guns
discover you're right about wrong reason
luxury: holding on to your thought - no one is paying 
premise the world is complex - in terms of learning, pretending to hold on to that pretense - simple point - what the next thign might be

## josh
1998
josh and esther 's advisor - emipirccal - causal effect

2021 nobel
applies answer - charter school 

it pays to be too (class size effect  - contribute - gotten bigger over year; do)'
not be dogmatic
findings can share

shouldn't try to win - enjoy economics
disciplined work for public policy

bob paron - cold calling (squared of josh angrist) - 
micro economics

win some converts - convert to economics discipline

## daron
1993
12 mit institute professor
dozens of area
not why but for which thing 
economic growth - reconomy plicy can play - democratice - 

cohort affect (1990s)
having good collegue
generral
vibe with my passion - didn't have a roadmap
lucky - passionate about

postdoc for six year - dent her enthusiasm - find sth like that - investment in technical learning all the tools and hard work 

interested in institution - daron was drawn to the isue
all of economics about two years (read so mcuh), technical element, engaing with theory and data

science is about information sharing - contribute to production 
bengt and 

thomas cun - normal science and paragigm shift - misses the point - nroal science is not doing what everyone eles is doing - you want to contribee to toehr ppl's thhinking

scariest ten word - i'm from the goverment, i'm here to help -  the most suprising ; pweres of had ni state and institution - incredible to think

achieved that - revolution, uprising, 

open-minded - greatest selling point - every discipline has its ; block change - max plank - science progress as one funeral at a time

even bengt (in every textbook - what was usual, but pppl embraced it)
lots of resistance, once results came in, ppl embraced
ppl to be able to choose economics - that could lead somewhere - 

---

tough like 6 ppl

open-minded -> 

innovation
