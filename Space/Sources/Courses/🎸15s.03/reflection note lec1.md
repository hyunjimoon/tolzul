- status quo: multi-faceted crisis
	- reproducibility (repeating the same thing produced different results), replication (is this even a reliable finding; sample two points and the same color), generalizability (does it even apply to other settings or populations), practicality (true test of a science its application in engineering; utility of my company (population and context))
- how did we get here
- how do we get out from here: open scholarship, collaboration (crowdsourcing), solution-oriented science, predictive utility
- all about metascientific perspectives

- mechanism design, auction is cumulative; amenable 
- the more unaccessible variable (endless )
- tradeoff between generalizable 
- theory is representation of how world works, (subject sense of understanding sth)
- theory making prediction so that it can be tested
- general relativity: gravitation wave
- rela (can be methamatized, simiplicity, (expected utility < ), correct)
- comparative statics
- measuure too fast and small mass
- other issues not brought up, which part of their response wasn't satisfactory (1 or 2)
- theory generation model: elicit from professors (with condition consistent with the past and personal vouch on holding in future)
- adversarial: sample that is counter to theory generation model
- efficient market hypothesis: no hope for prediction
- prisoner's dilemma is special case of public goods game when you give all or nothing
- two experiments differ in that supplier uncertainty is greater in synergy game as design space has uncertainty; demand uncertainty (population may be differ that can cause same design value would give different result of how good punishment is, e.g. heteroskedisticity in the large multiplier and long run game)
