Instructor: Abdullah Almaatouq <[amaatouq@mit.edu](mailto:amaatouq@mit.edu)> 

Lectures: Tuesday 12–3pm (lunch will be provided!) Location: E62-346

Prerequisites: Research methods coursework Office hours: By appointment

## Overview

In recent years, some researchers (myself included) have grappled with various crises in the social and behavioral sciences. It is not just about the much discussed reproducibility and replication crisis, but also issues such as a lack of theoretical coherence, empirical generalizability, and practical utility have led some to question the value of  academic research more broadly, including their own. It's become apparent that research can be methodologically rigorous, make a clear contribution to the field, get published in top journals, and be highly cited, yet still be meaningless in terms of providing genuine understanding or guiding action. Such skepticism often intensifies when faced with cynical views on academic research from those outside academia. (P.S. Another title for this course could have been "In Search for Meaning.")

In this seminar, we aim to explore what it would take to enhance research methods, logical reasoning, result interpretation, and overall practice within social and behavioral sciences. Our journey will involve examining metascientific issues, re-examining the foundations of scientific method, reflecting on the processes of scientific discovery, and proposing solutions to advance the field forward. 

Who is this course for? Anyone interested in improving the quality and impact of social and behavioral science research. But this course should be particularly interesting to those who believe that these issues are not fundamental and are exaggerated as it is an opportunity to offer a different perspective.

Keywords: replication, generalizability, practicality, commensurability, synthesis, coherency, null hypothesis testing, causal density, researcher degrees of freedom, p-hacking, HARKing, perverse incentives, physics envy, physics allergy, pragmatic methodology, mass collaboration, open scholarship, pre-registration, solution-oriented, integrative modeling and experimentation

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course, participants will be able to:

1. Assess the current landscape of social and behavioral sciences, identifying the key crises that are impacting their credibility and practical use.
    
2. Analyze the underlying factors contributing to these crises in a critical manner.
    
3. Engage in informed discussions about ongoing initiatives and reforms aimed at resolving these issues.
    
4. Develop and propose innovative reforms and solutions to steer the field towards a more constructive and impactful direction.
    

  

## Evaluation and Grading

In this course, I want you to be relaxed about everything, except the concepts. That said:

- 30% Class participation: You should consider that your participation in the discussion will be the key to benefiting from the class. You are also expected to present and lead the discussion on some papers ([sign up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q8jznxYyPbWnG9M9S_55lLAbSgQLW_sYgn2AsZRp-2c/edit?usp=sharing)). The number of people in the class will affect the implementation of this requirement.
    
- 30% Reading reports (due 11:59pm on Mondays): Each week, you will be asked to write a short reflection on the readings for that week and it to me by email. The basic idea is to begin an intellectual discussion about the thoughts that the reading inspired in you. The reflections could be about:
    

1. What you thought to be the most important contribution of the paper and why; what you found rather confusing, unclear, or that could be done in a better way
    
2. How this paper sheds light on the reproducibility, replication, incoherency, generalizability, practical utility issues and the connection between them
    
3. See example [reading prompts here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZfX7WVR70K7ctsK2uq2GerC8PLOO7xV04kC3p-nB2Y/edit)
    

- 40% Final project: You will be asked to write a “perspective piece” on these metascientific issues. The deadline is the 14th of May.

## Suggestions from Discussions:

- [Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03395.pdf)
    
- W5 context was ML/Bayes computation framework for modeling social science and Angie brought attention to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02439) which defines Bayesian models through the PAD taxonomy and proposing ten utility dimensions for evaluating their effectiveness. Abdullah’s two components of parsimony is P, A parsimony.
    

## Project ideas:

- Using the ML lingua franca to clean up the mess when we talk about:
    

- What theory is? (what do people mean by parsimony, arguments for interpretability)
    
- Generalizability 
    

- Quantitative descriptive analysis of the papers we are reading here
    

- Histogram of the mentioned core causes, derivative issues, and solutions
    
- … 
    

- Mapping the space of crises (Johanna, Angie: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKNmmc6A=/?share_link_id=701713907784](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKNmmc6A=/?share_link_id=701713907784) )
    

- Root/core issues
    
- Derivative problems
    
- Potential solutions 
    
- And their interaction
    

- Something about randomization inference
    

- How does RI relate to the issues we discussed in class?
    
- [Athey and Imbens published a handbook in 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00698) where they write “[W]e stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population.” Why is it (at least it seems to me) not used in the Social Sciences at all?

- [Blogpost critizing the above paper](https://datacolada.org/99)
    
- Can RI be used to test Meehl’s claim of ‘its just random’ and/or quantify the magnitude of the effects of unmeasured factors by using it to reanalyze a bunch of psychological studies e.g. Replication Project? Has somebody done sth like this already?

## Open access

The prohibitive cost of academic journals means that many of the readings for this course are not available to everyone. Fortunately, some of the more recent scholarships in this area are freely available to everyone in the world. If you do not have access to a university library, copies of many of the closed access articles can be found through Google Scholar.

## Further guidelines and policies

I intend to follow all relevant policies. Let me know if you think I’m missing something.
