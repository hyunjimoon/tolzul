# 1. why tech adoption
## stylized fact1
difference between TPF

surprisingly large TPF variance (differential across)

reduced by competition

## stylized fact2
spread between frontier and laggard firms widening over time
manufacturing and business service

spead  in time and spread opening over time

## stylized fact 3 growing ikmportance

within and btw firms (wage) within firms that pays a lot there are cluster

## stylized fact 4 growing wage polarization across workers, largely driven btw firm dynamic


---

firm dynamics slowing (right tails peaked)

five forces (business school), most of the at a point in time is positioning 

evolution of manufacturing - changes of structure (managerial subsidiaries)

world of changing

technology adoption is one of the major factor behind this
- productivity j curve -> underestimated productiviey --> overestimated productivity

J curve: skewed msr of productivity growht after a major tech is introduced
dip (learning; adoption) in productivity then exponential 

slope is hetereogenous across firms

sorro paradox ( you see computer everywhere except productivity statics - )

measurement of intagngialb e growth

tech -> level of technology

# 2. basic tech foundation

Y = (integ_0,1 alpha(i) y(i) rho di) 1/rho

tasks ordered by comparative advantage

cost minimization : firms chose cheaper input for each task i 

w/r = gamma_L(l)/ gamma_K(l)

task assignment
threshold under which to human and above which to capital
- labor performr tasks i 
- capital performr tasks i 

effects of automation in equilibrium

no creation of new tasks


which type of tasks are more exposed to substitution

automation vs task creation

reinstatement effect: new tasks restore labor demand

engogenous tech frontier: N = N(t) expands over time as a function of wages, feedback effects can amplify or dampen initial impacts

reallocate btw capital and humans

new occupations

 still very little explicit consideration for firm heterogeneity

beyond task-based models: knowledge hierarchices
- hierarchical structures with managers, knowledge is specialized and complementary across levels

not efficient to let everyone learn complex skills

tacit vs structured 

learning is living in individual

jorge's q: centralized (temp. is controlled central), decentralized price (value local kwldg)

david's q: asymmetric info. inference about my type, i don't wanna look bad


three learning= üß™experimenting, ‚öñÔ∏èscaling, üîêcodifying knowledge
