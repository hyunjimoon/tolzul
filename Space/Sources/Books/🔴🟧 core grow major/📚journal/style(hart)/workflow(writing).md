started from mailing [[alex_lew]] to consult on automating writing paper project. 

## **1. üìùcollect journal's evaluation metric** 
- (i) Does the paper address a question of managerial importance and relevance?¬†
- (ii) Does it change our thinking on an important topic in entrepreneurship or innovation?¬†
- (iii) Does the paper use appropriate methodology to answer the question convincingly and rigorously?¬† 
- (iv) Does it provide improved management principles to operate new ventures or manage innovation?¬† Successful manuscripts will usually be grounded in important phenomena; purely theoretical/conceptual pieces must explain the connection to managerial or policy importance. 
## 2. ü§ú human experts' recipe 
> 2. Based on Jose Arrieta's "Dialectical Contributions: Triangles All the Way Up," the human experts' recipe for creating impactful scientific contributions can be summarized as:

1. **Find the right audience** - Identify scholars who will care about your contribution and engage with your ideas. Without the right audience, even groundbreaking work will be ignored.
2. **Create a dialectical contribution** with three key components:
    - **Surprising element** (Thesis-Antithesis tension): Present a taken-for-granted idea (thesis) that your audience accepts, then introduce a counterpoint (antithesis) that challenges this assumption. This creates the "Huh" moment that captures attention.
    - **Valid element**: Make your contribution feel intuitively true to experts. The audience needs to "suspend disbelief" and feel that your idea makes sense within their existing framework.
    - **Important element**: Demonstrate why your contribution matters. This creates the "oh shit, if that is true..." reaction that motivates readers to continue engaging with your work.
3. **Guide toward synthesis** - Lead the audience to a new level of understanding that combines the thesis and antithesis into a more comprehensive theory.

## Three Files to Prepare

1. [[story(dialectical)]]
    
    - **Audience**: Profile of Bayesian entrepreneurship scholars [[scott(üß≠üó∫Ô∏èselling entrepreneurial choice-map as Bayes.Entrep)]]
    - **Thesis-Antithesis**: The accepted idea in Bayesian entrepreneurship and your challenging counterpoint
    - **Validity Elements**: Why your experiment design will be seen as methodologically sound and intuitively true
    - **Importance Elements**: Why your focus on incentives and information sharing matters to theory and practice
    - **Synthesis**: The new understanding and management principles that emerge from your work

2. [[design(experiment)]]
    
    - Detailed methodology for your experiment on incentives and information sharing
    - Key variables, measurements, and analytical approach
    - Expected results and how they connect to your theoretical contribution
    - Preliminary findings (if available)

3. [[map(journal)]]
    
    - Simple table mapping your contribution elements to the journal's four evaluation criteria
    - Include specific examples from your work that satisfy each criterion
    - Identify any potential gaps or weaknesses to address

## Three-Step Process

1. **Foundation Building**
    
    - Complete the dialectical framework document
    - Share with Claude for feedback
    - Refine your thesis-antithesis tension until it creates a compelling "Huh" moment
2. **Methodology Validation**
    
    - Develop your experiment design document
    - Ensure it provides the validity element needed for your contribution
    - Refine based on Claude's feedback to strengthen methodological rigor
3. **Journal Alignment**
    
    - Complete the mapping document
    - Identify how each aspect of your work satisfies journal criteria
    - Make final adjustments to strengthen any weak areas in your contribution framework

Each time you complete a document, share it with Claude for feedback and refinement. We'll work together to ensure your paper creates a compelling dialectical contribution that satisfies all journal criteria.
