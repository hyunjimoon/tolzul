Abstract. Entrepreneurs must choose between alternative strategies for bringing their idea to market. They face uncertainty regarding both the quality of their idea as well as the efÔ¨Åcacy of each strategy. Although entrepreneurs can reduce this uncertainty by conducting tests, any single test conÔ¨Çates the signal of the efÔ¨Åcacy of the particular strategy and the quality of the idea. Resolving this conÔ¨Çation requires exploring multiple strategies. Consequently, entrepreneurial choice is enhanced by Ô¨Ånding ways to lower the cost of testing multiple strategies, receiving guidance as to the types of tests likely to reduce signal conÔ¨Çation, and optimally sequencing tests based on previous beliefs. This creates a role for judgment that may be provided by trusted third parties such as mentors and investors. We hypothesize that institutions that lower the cost of transmitting and aggregating judgment spur entrepreneurial performance.

1. Direct Relevance to Processing Under Pressure: The organizing structure shows Section 2 focuses on "Processing Under Pressure" and examining what determines optimal speed/magnitude of resource allocation. Agrawal et al. (2021) more directly addresses this by:

- Providing a formal model of how entrepreneurs make choices under uncertainty and pressure
- Examining the specific tradeoffs between testing different strategies vs committing to one
- Analyzing how signals about idea quality vs strategy effectiveness get conflated under pressure

2. More Technical Treatment: Section 2 appears to be focused on the mathematical/analytical foundations of entrepreneurial decision-making. Agrawal et al. (2021) provides:

- A more rigorous formal model with precise mathematical treatment
- Specific propositions about optimal testing and strategy selection
- Detailed analysis of signal qualities (Œªv, Œªs) and their implications

3. Building on Prior Work: Agrawal et al. (2021) explicitly builds on and extends Gans et al. (2019). The paper notes that while Gans et al. (2019) provided useful axioms and an illustrative reduced-form model, Agrawal et al. (2021) develops "a novel and tractable model that explicitly considers the relationship between learning about the value of an idea versus the effectiveness of a particular strategy."
