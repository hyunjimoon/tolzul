# Management of Innovation

## Summary
Presents a canonical property rights model examining how control allocation between research units (RU) and customers (C) affects innovation incentives. When contracts cannot specify innovative outcomes directly, allocating ownership determines who captures value and thus determines effort levels. The model shows first-best is never achievable, and optimal ownership depends on relative marginal returns to effort.

## Research Question
In sequential innovation settings where contracts are incomplete, which party should own the innovation to maximize total surplus when both the research unit and customer make complementary investments?

## Key Concepts

### Contractual Incompleteness
Ex ante specifications are difficult for innovative outputs due to uncertainty. Ex post property rights are difficult to establish and enforce. Effort is nearly impossible to observe and verify.

### Property Rights Allocation
Early-stage researchers can capture value through ownership and access fees, enhancing incentives for early research but imposing a tax on follow-on activities.

### Bargaining Over Surplus
When RU owns the innovation, C and RU bargain ex post over licensing fee once innovation is realized. Assumptions typically divide surplus equally (V/2 to each party).

## Main Results

### Ownership and Investment Levels

**Customer Ownership:**
- RU receives no reward → supplies e = 0
- C has appropriate incentive → chooses E = E*(V)
- Profits: Π_RU = 0, Π_C = p(E)V - E

**Research Unit Ownership:**
- Both parties receive V/2 in success
- Both under-invest: e = e*(V/2), E = E*(V/2)
- Neither captures full social value

### Efficiency Conditions
Efficiency requires allocating ownership to the party with highest marginal returns to effort. However, financing constraints can lead to inefficient allocations.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: First-best outcome is never achievable - either one or both parties under-invest. The key policy implication is to allocate ownership to the party whose effort matters most for innovation success.

### Financial Constraints
When research units face financing constraints, control rights tend to shift toward the financing party (customers), even when this is inefficient for innovation incentives.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Theoretical property rights model
**Framework**: Two-party game with complementary investments
**Analysis**: 
- Probability of success: p(e, E) where e is RU effort, E is C investment
- Value of innovation: V
- Optimal choices: max_{e,E} {p(e,E)V - e - E}

## Application to Course

Connects to [[🗺️(15357)]] framework:
- Ideas production function: A' = f(L_A, K_A, A; Z_A, δ)
- This paper addresses Z_A: how institutional design (control allocation) affects innovation incentives
- Shows why contractual environment matters for L_A (who participates in research)
