Two-Sided Network Effects: A Theory of Information Product Design
https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0400

How can firms profitably give away free products? This paper provides a novel answer and articulates trade-offs in a space of information product design. We introduce a formal model of two-sided network externalities based in textbook economics‚Äîa mix of Katz and Shapiro network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation. Externality-based complements, however, exploit a different mechanism than either tying or lock-in even as they help to explain many recent strategies such as those of firms selling operating systems, Internet browsers, games, music, and video. The model presented here argues for three simple but useful results. First, even in the absence of competition, a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity. Second, we identify distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and show that either can be a candidate for a free good. Third, product coupling across markets can increase consumer welfare even as it increases firm profits. The model also generates testable hypotheses on the size and direction of network effects while offering insights to regulators seeking to apply antitrust law to network markets. Key words: network effects; network externalities; two-sided markets; free information; business models; strategic complements; product design

## 1. Parker & Van Alstyne (2005) Framework & Conclusions

**Framework:**

- Two-sided networks face a "chicken-and-egg" problem: need both sides to participate, but each side waits for the other
- Platform must decide which side to subsidize (even at a loss) to jumpstart the network
- Decision depends on: (1) price elasticity of each side, (2) strength of cross-side network effects, (3) same-side competition

**Key Conclusion:** Subsidize the side that is more price sensitive (elastic) first, especially when that side creates stronger value for the other side. This creates a "catalyst" user base that attracts the other side naturally.

## 2. Variable Comparison Table

|Parker & Van Alstyne|Your Framework|Conceptual Mapping|
|---|---|---|
|**Subsidy decision** (which side to subsidize)|**Engagement sequence** (which stakeholder first)|Both decide irreversible side prioritization|
|**Price elasticity** of each side|**PR, PC** (commitment probabilities)|Higher elasticity ‚âà Lower commitment probability (harder to convince)|
|**Cross-side network value**|**Cu, Co** (mismatch costs)|Strong network effects ‚âà High mismatch costs|
|**Market thickness** (# of users)|**D** (commitment state)|D=1: thick customer side, thin supplier side<br>D=-1: thick supplier side, thin customer side|
|**Subsidy cost**|**Engagement cost** (implicit in model)|Cost of attracting/convincing each side|
|**"Money side" vs "Subsidy side"**|**Resource partners vs Customers**|Money side pays; Subsidy side gets courted|

**Key Parallel:** Their "subsidize the elastic side when it creates high value for the other side" maps to your "prioritize resource partners when PR¬∑Co < PC¬∑Cu"‚Äîboth say to start with the harder-to-convince side if the mismatch cost of not having them is sufficiently high.
