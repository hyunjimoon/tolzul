Do entrepreneurial opportunities exist, independent of the perceptions of entrepreneurs, just waiting to be discovered? Or, are these opportunities created by the actions of entrepreneurs?"

The abstract describes two theories:

1. Discovery Theory - opportunities exist objectively and need to be discovered
2. Creation Theory - opportunities are created by entrepreneurial actions

2. **Alvarez & Barney 2007** - "Discovery and Creation: Alternative Theories" Abstract: "Do entrepreneurial opportunities exist, independent of the perceptions of entrepreneurs, just waiting to be discovered? Or, are these opportunities created by the actions of entrepreneurs?"

They're contrasting Discovery Theory vs Creation Theory and trying to bridge different approaches. The paper explicitly deals with the normative-positive divide issue, which is exactly what STRAP addresses by focusing on observable acceptance rather than beliefs. This would AGREE with STRAP.

**Why Selected**: This paper explicitly addresses the normative-positive tension in entrepreneurship theory by distinguishing between:

- **Discovery theory** (opportunities exist objectively and should be found through systematic search - normative approach)
- **Creation theory** (opportunities are created through entrepreneurial action - positive approach based on what entrepreneurs actually do)

**Relevance**: Their framework shows how the field has been trapped in debating what entrepreneurs "should" do (discover pre-existing opportunities) versus what they "actually" do (create opportunities through action). Your state variable approach sidesteps this by focusing on observable stakeholder acceptance regardless of whether opportunities are discovered or created.
