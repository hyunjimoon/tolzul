| Section/Subsection                | Question                                                             | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | üß±Literature Brick                                                                                                                                                          |

| 1. Theory-Based Prior Formation   | How do entrepreneurs form initial beliefs about opportunities?       | üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Entrepreneurs build priors through causal reasoning and theorizing about relationships between attributes (e.g., technology strength and market emergence). Their theories restrict the parameters of probability distributions, creating "logically persuaded" beliefs about value creation.   | ‚Ä¢ Camuffo et al. (2024b)<br>‚Ä¢ Karni (2022)<br>‚Ä¢ Bayesian networks (Pearl, 2000)<br>‚Ä¢ Carroll and Sorensen (2021)<br>‚Ä¢ Ehrig and Schmidt (2022)<br>‚Ä¢ Felin and Zenger (2017) |
| 2. Priors-on-Priors               | How do entrepreneurs handle awareness of their own uncertainty?      | üß≠ Entrepreneurs form "priors-on-priors" (œâ) representing their confidence in their theories versus alternative explanations. This "methodic doubt" acknowledges unforeseen contingencies and allows for both updating within a theory and potentially questioning the theory itself.                 | ‚Ä¢ Karni and Vier√∏ (2017)<br>‚Ä¢ Ortoleva (2012)<br>‚Ä¢ Pearl and Mackenzie (2018) counterfactual thinking                                                                       |
| 3. Experimental Choice and Design | How do entrepreneurs design experiments to test their theories?      | üåè Experiments can test parameter values within theories and, when results contradict expectations beyond a threshold, trigger updates to "priors-on-priors." Testing is most valuable when entrepreneurs compare competing theories, creating "exploration zones" with different optimal strategies. | ‚Ä¢ Camuffo et al. (2024b)<br>‚Ä¢ Gans et al. (2019)<br>‚Ä¢ Gans et al. (2024)<br>‚Ä¢ Karni and Vier√∏ (2013, 2017)<br>‚Ä¢ Ortoleva (2012)                                             |
| 4. Bayesian Persuasion            | How do entrepreneurs strategically share information with investors? | üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Entrepreneurs can design experiments that are "Bayes plausible" to influence investors' beliefs, with the receiver's posterior beliefs being the focus of the sender's attention. The Bayesian persuasion literature provides ways to compute optimal persuasive experiments.                   | ‚Ä¢ Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011)<br>‚Ä¢ Kamenica (2019)<br>‚Ä¢ Andrews and Shapiro (2021)                                                                                         |
| 5. Entrepreneurial Strategy       | How do Bayesian principles inform entrepreneurial strategy?          | üó∫Ô∏è Entrepreneurs must balance criticality (importance of hypothesis), fidelity (informativeness of the test), and opportunity cost when designing experiments. Experimentation is valuable when it tests "something that actually matters" by reducing significant uncertainty drivers.              | ‚Ä¢ Gans, Scott and Stern (2018, 2024)<br>‚Ä¢ Gans et al. (2019)<br>‚Ä¢ Mullainathan and Rambachan (2023)                                                                         |

## üóÑÔ∏è3: Practical Implications

|Domain|Implication|Example Application|
|---|---|---|
|**Startup Strategy**|Formalize theory testing with competing alternatives|Entrepreneurs can develop explicit decision trees with exploration zones for different theories, helping them decide when to experiment versus commit|
|**Investor Decision-Making**|Evaluate entrepreneurs based on theory quality and testing approach|Venture capitalists can assess not just the business idea but the entrepreneur's ability to form logical causal theories and design appropriate experiments|
|**Entrepreneurship Education**|Train entrepreneurs in causal reasoning and theory formation|Business schools can design courses on "Bayesian Entrepreneurship" teaching students to build causal networks, design experiments, and interpret results|
|**Incubator/Accelerator Programs**|Structure programs around theory testing rather than business plan execution|Programs can help startups articulate competing theories, design critical experiments, and make data-driven pivots based on results|
|**Corporate Innovation**|Apply Bayesian entrepreneurship to internal venture development|Large companies can use this framework to evaluate and develop internal ventures with more rigor and structure|
|**Public Policy**|Design entrepreneurship support programs that encourage experimentation|Government programs can subsidize critical experiments rather than business plans, focusing on reducing key uncertainties|
|**Research Methods**|Develop empirical approaches to study entrepreneurial theory formation|Researchers can design studies that capture how entrepreneurs form and test theories rather than just measuring outcomes|

## üñºÔ∏è1: Need-Solution Mapping

**Problem (üíú):**

- Entrepreneurs face deep uncertainty about both probabilities AND the relevant state space
- Simple Bayesian models fail to capture how entrepreneurs form initial beliefs and update theories
- Traditional experimentation approaches lack formal structure for optimal experiment design
- The relationship between belief formation, theory testing, and strategic decision-making is poorly understood

**Solution (üíö):**

- Deep Bayesian Learning framework that models:
    - Theory-based prior formation through causal reasoning
    - "Priors-on-priors" capturing confidence in theories
    - Two-level updating (within theories and between theories)
    - Explicit modeling of competing theories and exploration zones
    - Integration with strategic decision-making and experiment design

## üñºÔ∏è2: Methodology Visualization

**Exploration Zones Framework:**

The methodology shows how entrepreneurs should decide between committing to a theory versus experimenting based on expected values:

- Vertical axis: Expected value of theory 1 (V‚ÇÅ)
- Horizontal axis: Expected value of theory 2 (V‚ÇÇ)
- Diagonal line: V‚ÇÅ = V‚ÇÇ (indifference between theories)
- Exploration zones: Areas where experimenting is optimal
- Commitment zones: Areas where committing without further testing is optimal

Key insights:

- More uncertain theories increase their relative exploration zone
- Testing "contrarian beliefs" (theories with V‚ÇÅ < V‚ÇÇ) can be optimal
- Uncertain theories are complementary (having multiple uncertain theories increases the value of experimentation)
- The framework balances the tradeoff between information value and opportunity cost
