# Do Firms Underinvest in Long-Term Research? Evidence from Cancer Clinical Trials

## Summary
Documents private firms systematically underinvest in cancer treatments requiring long commercialization lags. Fixed-term patents create distortion: treatments for early-stage cancer require long trials (15+ years) versus late-stage treatments (2-3 years). Effect disappears for cancers using surrogate endpoints and for publicly-funded research, confirming mechanism.

## Research Question
Does the fixed-term patent system distort private R&D investment away from innovations requiring long development times?

## Key Concepts

### Commercialization Lag
Time from patent filing to market entry. Late-stage cancer drugs reach market quickly; preventatives/early-stage treatments require long trials.

### Patent Clock Problem
Patents expire based on filing date, not approval date. Long trials eat up patent protection period, reducing effective market exclusivity.

### Surrogate Endpoints
Biomarkers allowing faster clinical trial results for some cancers (e.g., PSA for prostate cancer), breaking link between disease severity and trial length.

## Main Results

### Negative Correlation
Strong negative relationship between commercialization lag (survival time) and R&D investment across cancer types.

### Surrogate Endpoint Test
Correlation disappears for cancers with validated surrogate markers, supporting causal interpretation.

### Public vs Private Research
Public research shows no systematic relationship between lag and investment; private research highly responsive to commercialization time.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: The patent system's structure creates systematic bias against socially valuable long-term innovation. This is market failure, not market wisdom about scientific opportunities.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Cross-sectional analysis with multiple identification strategies
**Data**: Cancer clinical trials; survival times by cancer type; patent data
**Analysis**: 
- Regression of R&D on survival time
- Surrogate endpoint heterogeneity test
- Public vs private funder comparison
