| **Definition**          | - Percentage of profits a participant receives from a project instead of/in addition to flat fee<br>- Usually means reduced upfront payment<br>- Can be taken from either net or gross profits                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Types of Points**     | 1. Net Points:<br>- Percentage of profit after breaking even<br>- Calculated after production and promotional costs<br>- Generally lower value due to accounting practices<br><br>2. Gross Profit Points:<br>- Percentage of total gross revenue<br>- More valuable as calculated before expenses<br>- Harder to negotiate<br><br>Gross Profit Point < Net Point ; d.junior was also investor (producer) and actor and .5B |
| **Sample Scenario**     | Film: "Angelic Visitor"<br>- Budget: $1M<br>- Gross Revenue: $2M<br>- Net Revenue: $1.5M<br>- Genre: Sci-fi thriller<br>- Timeline: 3 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Structure Example 1** | Distribution of $60k Producer Group Points:<br>- Producers (3): 1 point each = $6k each<br>- Writer: 1 point = $6k<br>- Director: 1 point = $6k<br>- Post-production: 2 points = $12k<br>- Lead actors: 1 point each = $6k each<br>- Company fund: 1 point = $6k                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Structure Example 2** | Split Structure:<br>- 50% Investor Share<br>- 50% Producer Share<br><br>Producer Share Options:<br>1. 30/30/30/10 split<br>2. 25/25/25/25 split<br>(with holdback for leverage)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Key Considerations**  | - Always define points clearly in contracts<br>- Hold back some points for future negotiations<br>- Different structures for different budget levels<br>- Need for clear waterfall structure<br>- Important to specify if points come from producer's share                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Industry Examples**   | Tom Hanks - "Saving Private Ryan":<br>- No upfront fee<br>- 20% of gross receipts<br>- Earned $40M total                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Best Practices**      | 1. Define points explicitly<br>2. Understand the waterfall structure<br>3. Reserve some points for flexibility<br>4. Get legal counsel<br>5. Consider investor accreditation<br>6. Document all agreements clearly                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
