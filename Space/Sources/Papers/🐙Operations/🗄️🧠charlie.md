parameter "c" also is relevant with founder's controllability as efficient founders orients toward more controllable side of sellability or deliverability as premature automation is more likely to be avoided with greater control. it has more potential to processify without automating 

 that's more controllable and   automated 
Charlie i'm adding precision to your two tools: "replicate" and "automate".

from the two cases (ASB, Renetech), i infer "automate" happens in delivering side () whereas "replication" is for selling side. however, i feel automating is "outsourcing without understanding" (reason why automation can precipitate  processification). this can happen both in demand and supply side.  

in that sense, do you agree to deliver your warning against "premature automation", "automated processification" and "automated replication" might be a better framing?

# processify
Think of a process as: "an organized group of related activities [tasks] that work together [to create] value to the customer" (Michael Hammer, 2001). Well-defined processes enable efficiency and repeatability while allowing delegation and decentralization.
All start-ups need to invent processes for their development and business needs as they grow.
The first time a process is undertaken, to solve some new problem faced by the organization, it might be called a "hack." The second time around, you're still hacking, but the steps and sequence might be a bit clearer. But before an organization starts scaling, its processes typically require knowledge, practice, identified customers, debugging, metrics, some predictability, and a process owner.

Task standardization is a prerequisite to process definition, regularization, and reproducibility. Process discipline is a key component of processification. Lack of process adherence is functionally the absence of process. "The only thing worse than a bad process is no process." (Michael Hammer). But, if you freeze processes too soon, the enterprise may lose needed flexibility when it's needed.

Every process should have an owner, a well-defined customer, and relevant metrics. Process design requires very different capabilities from process execution. Many "sailors" who are experts at running processes in mature organizations are at a complete loss if asked to design new processes in an early-stage start-up or a rapidly scaling organization.

Therein lies the danger of hiring "expert" professional sailors into a new enterprise. Initially, they will need to be familiarized with their new environment and culture. And they need to know or learn the skills to design new processes that may need to be very different from the requirements in their previous organizations.

# professionalize

Scaling requires that the organization transition from generalist founders to specialist professionals. One challenge with such professionals is that their first inclination is often to try to reproduce exactly the functions and systems they had in their previous organizations, before learning the particular culture and challenges of their new organizations. Integrating new professionals (in marketing, finance, operations, procurement, IT, legal, etc. etc.) into the company culture is crucial to successful organizational growth. Such new hires, if they are effective, will surely influence the culture, but they need to do so by understanding the perspectives of the founding team. So, while the founding nailers may feel they are starved for the capabilities that come with bringing in professionals to help, feelings can turn sour if the cultural chasm is too vast.

Bringing in a "professional CEO" can be the most delicate task in this stage of the organization's journey. Some nailing CEOs smoothly adjust to the scaling challenges. But others do not. If the founding CEO is not well suited to scaling, but the team clings to the personality and culture that their initial leader exuded, then the Board should hope to find a new leader who can reassure the team, but lead the scaling stage with vigor and rigor.

Professionalization brings more structure, with clearer lines of command and reporting, and more risk of creating silos across the organization. Leadership needs to scale up the communication capabilities of the organization to keep all the organization components still working on the same team and the same mission, even though each group has its own sub-tasks, and newly minted KPIs in many cases.
Professionals also bring expertise for compliance, rules, and standards -- capabilities not often found in the jungle environment. But, as the company scales, the risks of not following rules increase. Having the right team is arguably the single most important component of scale-up success.
Ultimately, you must hire for the organization you want to become, not the one that got you through the jungle.


# acculturate

A strong, positive, continually reinforced culture serves as the glue that keeps an organization together, especially once it has outgrown its single room with constant face-to-face communication amongst the founding team. (If that team room is a "Zoom room," the challenges of creating and nurturing the culture are even greater.)
Building, evolving, and nourishing a culture that supports the organization's goals and values is critical to efficient scaling. During rapid growth, the sheer number of employees and partners that are added creates significant challenges to acculturate every new joiner, as well as maintain the passion amongst the organization's veterans.

Entropy is a natural phenomenon in virtually all organizations, so a culture that is not constantly communicated is liable to fragment over time. Cultural reinforcement must remain the job of the top leadership team. Say it every day if you mean it:

Culture starts with the mission and the values. If these elements are expressed with authenticity and passion and are reinforced every day, they will inculcate habits of reinforcement throughout the organization. Such consistency is a tall order for large groups of people.

Further, as the organization grows, the culture will be dynamic. Guiding this process requires thought, attention, and lots of communication, and when moving from the jungle to the mountain to the ocean, leaders should acknowledge publicly the evolution and transformation of this culture.

Minl Case Study: In their book "How Google Works" (2017), former CEO Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg paint a vivid portrait of the creativity and fluidity within Google culture in its early days. More recently, many former employees and commentators have lamented the corporatization of Google and the diminishment of the culture that sparked so much success Yet, a March 2024 Wired story that relates the creation of the transformer model that has revolutionized AI, describes a serendipitous process that has delivered an innovation, so impactful that it literally has changed the world, just as Google Search did three decades earlier. So, despite the dramatic corporatization of the Internet giant, embers of the early innovation-encouraging culture live on.

# automate
In the nailing stage, when so many activities are experiments that will be adjusted on the next iteration, processes are typically manual by necessity. The flexibility to experiment and adjust repeatedly is the essence of the nailing journey. However, once processification is well underway, manually repeating processes ad nauseum rarely helps quality or productivity.

Computers and robots are very good at perfect repeatability of well-defined tasks so automating physical and information processes can enable increased efficiencies of workflows.

Automation, done well, simplifies operations by eliminating manual tasks, saving staff from repetitive workloads. However, successful automation requires that processification be done thoughtfully, and there needs to be confidence that the products and processes will be reasonably stable.

Automation can turbocharge an organization's growth capabilities. However, done poorly, "implementing [ERP] is like pouring concrete into a company." ("Liquid Concrete," The Economist, Sep 13, 2007).
Where labor costs are low, and programming skills are dear, automation is likely to progress more slowly, but even in low labor cost regions, a great deal of effort is often invested in automation, once serious scaling commences.
Advocates of AI systems trumpet the opportunities for even greater levels of automation across a broad range of tasks -- physical and intellectual -- historically performed by humans. Learning to exploit such opportunities will require significant experimentation. So scaling firms must not discard their nailing skills -- they will be needed for scaling and automating processes.

# segment
Early in the nailing stage, entrepreneurs are encouraged to develop their "minimum viable product" for their "beachhead market" (Bill Aulet, MIT, 2024), and by necessity, a single market segment is typically targeted. If that target is well chosen, the "total addressable market" will enable the firm to begin generating revenue and trigger the growth process. However, as, successful firms saturate their beachhead markets, they must explore how to drive growth into adjacent or different market segments. Such segmentation almost always accompanies the scaling stage and typically requires additional and more fragmented efforts in marketing, sales, engineering, product development, finance, and operations.
If processification is well underway, some of the developed processes will need to give way to specialized sub-processes. If automation commences too early, costly rework of automated processes may be required to accommodate new market segments with different needs. Segmentation almost always adds complexity and cost to the operations functions that support the products and services designed for the multiplicity of segments. Thus, segmentation is critical for scaling but will challenge the operations function to expand its breadth of activities. Despite scale economies, unit costs may increase.
In the nailing stage, the first customers, are often found one by one, requiring significant investment by the founding team. As a company scales, this approach no longer physically works, but it is critical to continue the mindset of staying close to the customers, to continue to test new product or service ideas, and to remain responsive to feedback.

Segmentation can bring conflict -- particularly between the sales and operations teams. Sales will typically want to serve as many customers as possible, despite a plethora of idiosyncratic demands. Operations will want to exploit high-volume processes and automation, made easier by lower product variety. Such tension must be addressed by senior leadership. A well-worn adage states that the first requirement of a good strategy is knowing what you are willing to say "NO" to. Some segments may not be worth pursuing

Senior leadership therefore must articulate a strategy that addresses potential segmentation and growth conflicts -- and put in place (with the help of Finance and HR) metrics and incentive structures to enable teamwork toward common goals, rather than creating silos with opposing objectives.

# evaluate

Even when founders articulate a clear vision for their future, internal alignment will require systems to set milestones, measure progress, and identify potential problems. Metrics enable organizations to manage the performance of professionalized teams and the effectiveness of processes.

Evaluation is also critical for demonstrating the responsible use of investor funds.

Once different teams have (appropriately) different metrics, challenges in organization alignment will arise. Further, the enactment of narrowly defined metrics can stifle the innovative spirit that brought the firm its initial success.

On the one hand, the scaling firm must focus on a concise set of objectives and create a measurement system to support those objectives. However, organizations at all stages still need innovation and creativity, and employees energized to feel that their contributions are appreciated.

So KPIs and the like must be used in conjunction with "qualitative" assessments that matter in the organization, and that rely on leadership judgment to encourage support of overall corporate goals. In many organizations, crossdepartment collaboration (which can be harder to measure) is at least as important as within-department focus.
After the long jungle trek, riddled with ambiguity, many employees may welcome the relief of having a more concrete set of tasks and goals. Start-up fatigue is not only physically rough on people, from long hours devoted to trying to validate the business concept, but also spawns mental fatigue, catalyzed partly by the stresses of uncertainty.
Objective metrics enable organizations to set milestones to help prioritize time and resource allocation.

# platformize
The Internet age has witnessed remarkable scaling speed and scale economies enjoyed by some companies (e.g.. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber, Wanbaba, TenCent) that have exploited what is referred to as a platform business model. (See e.g., Cusumano, Gawer, \& Yoffie (2019) or Parker, van Alstyne \& Choudary (2016).)
The core idea is to establish a central "platform" that is attractive to multiple kinds of users (e.g., buyers and sellers), which can trigger explosive growth as the addition of more of one type of user (e.g., buyers) attracts a larger number of the other type(s) (e.g., sellers), and vice versa. The model of creating such marketplaces (with "cross-network externalities") is as old as the village square or the shouk, but the Internet has enabled scaling speed to be exponentially faster.

In some cases, a good platform can beat an excellent product, so scaling with a platform provides a great opportunity when the business model can accommodate such a structure. Still, this scaling tool must be viewed as exactly that: a tool. Not all businesses are a good fit for this type of business model and attempting to scale in this way requires a well-thought-out business plan and a process for triggering initial growth from at least one "side" of the platform.

Mini Case Study: Apple initially built a user base of "music lovers" through aggressive marketing of its iPod product. Once it had many iPod users, Apple was able to sign on music companies to sell their songs on the iTunes platform, which, in turn, attracted even more music lovers to the iPod. Once the iPod gave way to the iPhone, the iTunes platform was able to add a third side to their platform, with a third type of "user," the app developer, which turbo-charged growth even further.

# collaborate

Very few firms can do it all themselves. Most start-ups collaborate with supplier partners, channel partners, technology partners, distribution partners, etc. Especially when the firm is small, partnering can be challenging, because a small start-up has little leverage with a large supplier or distributor.

A successful young firm that has already started scaling has potentially much more leverage to develop relationships with attractive partners. However, collaborative relationships typically require some manner of sharing the pie. Thus, a collaborator is often both a value-adding partner and a competitor for a share of the total valuechain profits available.

Sometimes collaboration can be a short-term engagement (sharing resources for example); sometimes it can lead to more significant relationships that might eventually evolve into a merger or acquisition opportunity.

Strategic suppliers or distributors can significantly extend the reach of the growing company to sources or customers that might not otherwise be accessible.

Collaboration helps companies scale as long as it can provide mutual benefits, is meaningful and mission-driven. and is based on complementary skills, interests, or goals.
However, such relationships can add complexity, as the scaling organization must balance multiple interests while keeping an eye on its own long-term goals.

# replicate
For many business models, scaling requires replication and reproducibility. Once a process has been refined, it may need to be replicated in many locations and settings, sometimes identically, and sometimes with modifications for localized needs for different market segments.
Organizations need documentation, training, and measurement to support the capabilities and outcomes of replication efforts.
Some retail organizations, like McDonald's and Walmart for example, have proved to be masters of replication, building thousands of retail stores, each of which provides a very similar, If not identical, value proposition. Such models provide very strong economies of scale, whereby innovations in products and/or processes can be provided and implemented many, many times over.

Some manufacturing companies also employ replication strategies, having refined processes in one location, they "copy exactly" the factory processes in another location.

Successful replication requires thorough documentation and specification of the required processes as well as thorough training of both the teams that will build the replicated operations, as well as those who will run the systems involved.

Mini-Gase Study: After oil prices quadrupled in less than a decade in the 1970's, Toyota Motor Corporation got a beachhead in the United States in the early 1980s, and aspired to scale from primarily a national company to a global company. Despite the skepticism of many, the company was able to replicate its vaunted Toyota Production System (TPS) in numerous factories across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Through intensive training regimens applied to each new site, supported by Toyota employees and suppliers, thousands of new Toyota employees were able to master the system of TPS, and deliver quality vehicles on par with those produced by Toyota in Japan.

# capiltalize
For most start-ups capital investment is critical. A great deal of attention is typically paid to how start-ups can attract and negotiate for initial capital investment.
Capital requirements for scaling can vary very widely, depending on the nature of the business.

A software company offering a B2C app, for example, will need to pay for engineers, programmers, marketing, product managers, and cloud services, but requires little in terms of facilities, equipment, or any other capital equipment.

However, the capital requirements for scaling in manufacturing, for example, to support factories, warehouses, personnel, and infrastructure - sometimes across multiple global locations -- will often dwarf what was needed for the initial start-up, depending on the business.

In such cases, leadership can be faced with "The Founder's Dilemma" (Noam Wasserman, 2013) of needing to give up significant control if they want access to the necessary capital to exploit growth opportunities.
Software entrepreneurs (at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, for example), not needing nearly as much capital, may be able to retain significantly more ownership and control than those in heavy manufacturing.
Choosing the right investor is critical. Ash Patel of Morado Ventures believes that good and experienced investors should be able to catalyze growth by making warm introductions for a start-up, as well as by passing on learnings from previous companies. In Patel's words, "If your investors can't help in this way, they're the wrong investors! ... When you choose your board, you choose your boss...Don't pick a firm, pick an individual... Just as there has to be chemistry between founders, there must be chemistry between founders and investors." (During the SVC2UK CEO Summit, 2013)

# organizational entropy

**Proposition:Organizational Entropy exists**

**Second Law of Thermodynamics.** This law states that, as one goes forward in time, the net **entropy** (degree of disorder) of any isolated

or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same). (http://www.exactlywhatistime.com/physics-of- time/the-arrow-of-time/)

**Entropy** is the tendency towards disorder (if no energy is exerted to reduce such disorder).

**What is Organizational Entropy?**

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs imagine that we start a company by sticking 20 people in an office with an ill-defined but ambitious goal and no further leadership. We tell them we‚Äôll pay them as long as they‚Äôre there, working. We come back two months later to find that five of them have quit, five are sleeping with each other, and the other ten have no idea how to solve the litany of problems that have arisen. The employees are certainly not much closer to the goal laid out for them. The whole enterprise just sort of falls apart.‚Äù

# fiedelity of replication

Replication: For many business models, scaling requires replication and reproducibility. Once a process has been reÔ¨Åned, it may need to be replicated in many locations and settings, sometimes identically, and sometimes with modiÔ¨Åcations for localized needs for a different market segment. Organizations need to document and train and measure the capabilities and outcomes of replication efforts. Illustrative cases: Unity Homes, VFA.

Unity Homes was conceived to offer lower-priced homes but with a similar value proposition with regard to quality and energy efÔ¨Åciency. Unity homes were custom designed on a modular platform but offered less variety, less complexity, and smaller footprints than the typical Bensonwood home. Unity initially produced its panels in the Bensonwood factory, but that facility was not optimized for lower costs or lower variety required for the mid-tier market. In 2018, Unity opened a second factory in New Hampshire, designed for higher volume, lower variety, and lower cost, and had plans for replication of this factory design in different locations across the United States. The desire to maintain family control and expand through internally generated cash only slowed the growth as compared with what might be possible with a broader capitalization strategy.

VFA deployed a platformization strategy to create a business and management internship ‚Äúfellows‚Äù program to match high-capability US millennials with startup companies that might not otherwise have ready access to such talent. Inspired in part by Teach for America, VFA aimed to recruit the best and brightest from the top universities, with a culturalization strategy to instill common innovation and entrepreneurship values throughout their network. VFA targeted small, entrepreneurial ventures in ‚Äúsecond tier‚Äù entrepreneurial US cities (i.e., outside places like Silicon Valley, Boston, etc.) and deployed its elite troops into those Ô¨Årms, providing these startups with Ô¨Årst-class, albeit raw talent, and providing its recruits with a worm‚Äôs eye, hands-on experience in building a business. The Ô¨Årst cities selected, Detroit, New Orleans, and Providence, had existing entrepreneurial ecosystems in place but had a high need for exceptional talent. VFA then scaled their model with a replication strategy, copying the initial model for many other cities. The startups paid salaries to the fellows, but much of the organization‚Äôs overhead was covered by benefactors, whose donations represented charitable contributions for the sake of driving an industrial renaissance in some of America‚Äôs bygone business centers.
# organizational clockspeed
Further, all manufacturing leaders rotate positions, geographically and functionally, every two or three years. These steps have helped reduce organizational clockspeed to about six months and prevent the formation of ‚Äúsilos‚Äù or proprietary internal functions.

Thus, we can see that ASP has responded to increases in clockspeeds across its products, process, and organization structures. Building on these insights, I next present a systematic methodology for dynamic clockspeed analysis of the chains and illustrate it with examples from defense aerospace and information-entertainment.

----

One tack for assessing organizational clockspeed is suggested by a 1997 article in the New York Times, which observed that in the 1990s, increased stockholder activism and impatient corporate boards seem to have led to an decrease in the average tenure of CEOs in large, publicly-held companies.22 Closely related, a research study at Stanford University measured organizational clockspeed by looking at the frequency of organizational restructurings. 23 That study found that industry sectors where the product clockspeed was higher tend also to have faster organizational clockspeeds.

Next I look at universities, a traditionally slow-clockspeed sector, and observe that their main activities -- education and research as information commodities -- may see their organizational clockspeeds driven to dizzying rates.

### Process Bottlenecks

The critical path method and the design structure matrix are designed for and applied primarily to the analysis of a single engineering project. Often, each project within a company is managed by its own project manager, not infrequently a heavyweight project manager, as suggested by the lean production paradigm, 211 who may have a great deal of autonomy in managing his or her project, using tools such as CPM and DSM. In such cases, however, there are often resources in the firm that must be shared across multiple projects. For example, in a semiconductor design house, the prototype manufacturing facility is often be shared across all the design projects. In an automotive company, the clay model shop, where models of the concept vehicles are made, is typically shared by the designers in various divisions, each of which is working on its own projects.

The process bottleneck perspective, explored in work by research teams at MIT and Stanford,212  reconceptualizes the product development function as analogous to a factory for product development. Instead of focusing on the activities and relationships within the CPM or DSM model for each project, the process bottleneck approach focuses on the resources to be used by all the projects. These resources collectively represent the firm‚Äôs product development factory. Applying the concepts from Goldratt‚Äôs ‚Äútheory of constraints,‚Äù which states that all factories have a bottleneck (or ‚Äúconstraint‚Äù) resource, 213 one then looks for the constraint resources in the company‚Äôs product development ‚Äúfactory.‚Äù

In the product development context, when multiple projects compete for bottleneck resources, each must wait in queue for its turn to access the constraint capacity. Managing these queues and the relative demand versus supply of capacity at them typically has an enormous impact on the development time of the individual projects. In one study at Polaroid, for example, individual projects under the direction of several project managers working separately were often completed many months, or even years, later than scheduled in the CPM models. 214 Our analysis, using the process bottleneck perspective, concluded that these models had ignored in their calculations the large chunks of time that projects waited for an opportunity to be serviced by the scarce bottleneck resources. Once top management realized that someone in the organization below the level of CEO needed to ‚Äúown the process‚Äù of assessing the capacity levels of various product development resources, the knowledge was available to reduce project completion times significantly.

... üëìA number of tools from multiple perspectives exist for two-dimensional concurrent engineering to support this process, including the various perspectives defined by DFM, project scheduling, design structure, process bottleneck, and customer requirements.


... As important as this insight and accompanying analysis is, its power can be increased by applying it to an integrated 3-DCE framework. In many development projects, supplier contributions can be the bottlenecks. These suppliers serve a large number of projects, sometimes more than one from the same customer. Adding key suppliers as resources in the model and, for those who may be bottlenecks, then managing them as carefully as internal bottlenecks are managed, can have a huge impact on total project time and performance.

In a research project at General Motors, we analyzed one of the key bottlenecks for the entire vehicle development process: the provision of stamping dies, large steel tools that provide the shape for all stamped metal body parts. 215

## **How Operational Excellence Pushes the Trade-off Frontier**

The operations management document provides crucial support for your argument through the **efficient frontier** concept. Here's the key insight:

### **Traditional View: Repositioning on the Frontier**

Most strategic thinking assumes entrepreneurs must **reposition** along an existing trade-off curve:

- **More prediction** ‚Üí Better stakeholder understanding but slower response
- **More prescription** ‚Üí Faster action but higher misalignment risk

This is like the document's example of airlines choosing between cost efficiency OR variety - accepting the trade-off as fixed.

### **Operational Excellence: Pushing Out the Frontier**

The document shows operations can **overcome trade-offs entirely** through enhanced capabilities. Key quote:

> "operations performance improvement is achieved by overcoming trade-offs, which, in turn, is achieved through enhanced operations capabilities"

**Example**: Operation B achieved better variety AND cost efficiency simultaneously through modular design, "pushing out the efficient frontier."

### **Applied to Your Framework**

Your push-pull integration represents **frontier-pushing operational excellence**:

- **Traditional approaches** accept the prediction-prescription trade-off
- **Your integrated approach** develops new capabilities that enable simultaneous learning AND betting
- This overcomes the dilemma rather than just repositioning within it

The document even mentions the **"tyranny of either/or"** vs **"and/also" approach** - perfectly capturing your integrated solution that achieves both robustness AND efficiency.

**Bottom line**: Operational excellence doesn't just optimize within constraints - it develops new capabilities that transcend traditional trade-offs entirely.
