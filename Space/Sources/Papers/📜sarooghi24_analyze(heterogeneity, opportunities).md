## Abstract

While the growing body of knowledge on entrepreneurship as design has provided a fresh perspective on entrepreneurial opportunities by studying their emergence and development as artifacts, we still lack a coherent understanding of what constitutes variance in opportunity artifacts. In this paper, we discuss why studying variance in opportunity artifacts is important and argue that the business model concept is a suitable and promising locus for conceptualizing such variance. We conclude by offering a research program that positions studying variance in the business model of opportunity artifacts within a design view of the entrepreneurship nexus.
