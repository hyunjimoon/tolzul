**Agree - Packard et al. (2017)**: "Uncertainty Types and Transitions in the Entrepreneurial Process" Abstract: "This paper develops a typology of uncertainties faced by entrepreneurs, distinguishing between uncertainties about the future state of the world and uncertainties about how to interpret current information. We argue that entrepreneurial action transforms absolute uncertainty into more tractable forms of uncertainty through mechanisms that create new information and enable learning." _Relevance: Supports modeling observable states rather than subjective beliefs, as entrepreneurs need to transform unmeasurable uncertainty into measurable constructs._
