# Patents and Innovation: Evidence from Economic History

## Summary
Uses 19th century World's Fair exhibitions to study innovation with varying patent protection across countries. Finds no difference in overall innovation rates between countries with/without patent laws, but differences in type: countries without patents specialized in industries relying on secrecy (chemicals), while countries with patents had more diversified innovation portfolios.

## Research Question
How do patents affect the rate and direction of innovation?

## Key Concepts

### World's Fair Exhibitions
Showcase of cutting-edge innovations from all countries (1851-1915). Provides comprehensive innovation data before modern patent statistics.

### Natural Experiment
Variation in patent law existence and strength across countries in 19th century provides identification.

## Main Results

### Rate of Innovation
No appreciable difference in innovation rates across countries with different IP protection levels.

### Direction of Innovation
Countries without patent laws specialized in secrecy-dependent industries (chemicals requiring tacit knowledge). Countries with patents showed diversified innovation across industries.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: Patents don't increase overall innovation but change its composition toward more diverse/codifiable knowledge. Absence of patents drives specialization in tacit-knowledge industries.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Historical analysis of World's Fair exhibits
**Data**: Innovation lists from Crystal Palace and subsequent fairs; country patent law data
**Analysis**: Cross-country comparison of innovation rates and sectoral composition

## Connections

**Builds on**:
