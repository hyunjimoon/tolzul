 **Imagination, Indeterminacy, and Managerial Choice at the Limit of Knowledge**

abstract: This article presents an introduction to the special topic forum on imagination, indeterminacy, and managerial choice at the limit of knowledge for the present issue of¬†_The Academy of Management Review._¬†Events and conditions like pandemics spur people and organizations to create new knowledge, engage in novel behaviors, and build innovative products and services that did not previously exist. Managers tend to be creatures of habit, thriving on standard operating procedures, routines, and rational expectations of the future. This side of managing has been well-studied, and a robust conceptual vocabulary and toolkit exists in management theory to understand it. 

However, the difficulties brought on by recent events reveal an imbalance in management theory and practical advice. The construct of bounded rationality has been quite generative for management theory and research, shaping the field in very fundamental and successful ways. This imaginative view of choice at the limit of managerial knowledge assumes that order and possibility is a function of ‚≠êÔ∏èwhat managers know rather than being impressed on the managerial mind from external sources. The ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äúconstructivist-leaning‚Äù themes in management scholarship have also been generative and important.‚≠êÔ∏è Yet the construct of fundamental uncertainty animating and motivating them remains under-theorized and fragmented. This Special Topic Forum was conceived with the goal of providing more coherence and focus to the construct, and to repurpose it from being a background assumption in certain constructivist streams of management theorizing to a foreground focal construct capable of carrying additional theoretical weight and possessing even greater theoretical generativity.

reconfigurative and projective theories as responses to conditions of uncertainty versus indeterminacy.
