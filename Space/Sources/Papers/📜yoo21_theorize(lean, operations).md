Abstract. The lean start-up method (LSM) advocates an iterative and adaptive product development and testing approach to innovation. It recommends ﬁrms to build test products, use them to learn about consumer preferences, and modify (or “pivot”) the product design accordingly. It is less straightforward to understand how effective LSM can be, however, not least because consumers’ responses to the test product are inﬂuenced by its quality, price, and design—that is, learning is endogenous to the features of the test product. This paper analyzes the build-test-learn cycle of LSM using an analytical model to understand its microfoundation and how best to implement it. We ﬁnd that an optimal test product that maximizes learning should aim either to conﬁrm a more likely product design or to rule out a less likely product design as being the most desired by consumers, have a vertical quality that is neither too high nor too low, and have a higher quality when aiming to conﬁrm than to rule out. We also identify the product-market conditions for which the LSM is more effective. Conceptualizing the LSM via a formal model may help to improve its implementation in practice and to advance further academic research.
