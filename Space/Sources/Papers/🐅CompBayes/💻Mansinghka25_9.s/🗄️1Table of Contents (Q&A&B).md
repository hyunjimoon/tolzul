They involve too many moving parts that affect each other, leading entrepreneurs to copy others' behaviors instead of figuring out what works best for their unique situation.                                                       | 🧍‍♀️ Cognitive limitations in decision-making |

# Entrepreneurial Decision Model Optimization Formulation

## State Space

- Binary state vector: $\textcolor{green}{S} \in {0,1}^3$
- States represent: [Investor State, Product Strategy State, Customer Explanation State]

## Action Space

- Action vector: $\textcolor{red}{A} \in \mathbb{R}^3$
- Actions represent: [Investor Action, Supply Action, Demand Action] (capitalize, collaborate, segment)

## Utility Functions

- Multi-stakeholder utility: $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U} = B\textcolor{green}{S}$
- $B \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ maps states to utilities: $$B = \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} \ b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} \ b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33} \end{bmatrix}$$
- Individual stakeholder utilities: $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}$, $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}$, $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$

## Preferences

- Preference vector: $\textcolor{purple}{W} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ weights stakeholder utilities
- $\textcolor{purple}{W} = [\textcolor{purple}{W_d}, \textcolor{purple}{W_s}, \textcolor{purple}{W_i}]$ (customer, society, investor weights)

## Cost Function

- Cost vector: $C \in \mathbb{R}^3$ represents cost of actions
- Budget constraint: $C\textcolor{red}{A} \leq R$ (total cost must not exceed resources)

## State Transitions

- State transition tensor: $D \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times \textcolor{red}{A} \times \textcolor{green}{S} \times \textcolor{green}{S}}$
- Industry-specific transition probabilities: $P(\textcolor{green}{S'}|\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A})$
- Constraint: $D(\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A}) = 0$ (valid state transitions)

## Temporal Dynamics

- Future utility depends on current utility and preferences: $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_{t+1}} = f(\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_t}, \textcolor{purple}{W_t})$
- Utility is non-additive (spatial complexity): $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_E}(x_1,x_2) \neq \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_E}(x_1) + \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_E}(x_2)$

## Optimization Problem

Solve the sequential decision-making problem:

$$\arg\min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \textcolor{purple}{W_d} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$$

Subject to:

- $B\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}]$
- $C\textcolor{red}{A} \leq R$
- $D(\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A}) = 0$

## Solution Approach

The optimal action sequence is determined by:

$$\nabla_{\textcolor{red}{A}} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U}(\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A})/C(\textcolor{red}{A})$$

This gradient provides the direction of maximum utility increase per unit cost, enabling efficient traversal of the decision polyhedron.
