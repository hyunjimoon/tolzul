# Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Cumulative Research and the Patent Law

## Summary
Analyzes optimal patent design for cumulative innovation where second-generation products build on first-generation discoveries. Shows broad early patents with efficient licensing can implement second-best incentives for both stages, even when social planner cannot set ideal rewards for each stage independently.

## Research Question
How should patent breadth and licensing rules be designed to provide appropriate incentives across sequential stages of cumulative innovation?

## Key Concepts

### Sequential Innovation
First innovator creates foundational technology; second-generation innovators build improvements. Both stages require incentives.

### Patent Breadth
How much protection first innovator receives over follow-on applications. Broad patents give early innovator more control; narrow patents allow easier follow-on entry.

### Efficient Licensing
When transaction costs low, early-stage innovators can license to follow-on innovators, extracting "tax" on downstream research while enabling it to occur.

## Main Results

### Broad Patents + Licensing
Broad early patents with efficient licensing implement second-best by: giving first innovator appropriate reward, allowing follow-on innovation to occur, enabling early innovator to capture some downstream value.

### Without Licensing
If licensing markets fail, narrow patents may be better despite under-rewarding early innovators, as they enable follow-on entry.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: Efficient contracting among innovators plus broad patents can achieve second-best outcomes even without perfectly tailored incentives for each stage.

## Methodology
