# Relational Contracts and the Theory of the Firm

## Summary
Integrates **formal contracts** and **relational contracts** into unified theory of the firm. Shows that firm boundaries depend not just on ownership (property rights) but also on the strength of relational contracts. Revolutionizes thinking about integration by showing that relationships can substitute for or complement ownership.

## The Core Innovation

**Previous theories** (Coase, Williamson, GHM):
- Firm boundaries determined by transaction costs or property rights
- Integration or market, binary choice
- **Missing**: Role of ongoing relationships

**BGM 2002 contribution**:
- Adds **relational contracts** to the picture
- Shows formal + relational interact
- Firm boundaries now depend on:
  1. Property rights (à la GHM)
  2. Relational contracts
  3. **Their interaction**

## Key Concepts

### Relational Contracts
**Definition**: Self-enforcing agreements sustained by value of future relationship

**Characteristics**:
- Not court-enforceable
- Based on trust, reputation
- Sustained by future rents (shadow of the future)
- **Example**: Implicit promises, handshake deals, "understanding"

### Formal Contracts
**Definition**: Court-enforceable written agreements

**Characteristics**:
- Legally binding
- Can specify verifiable outcomes
- Limited by verifiability
- **Example**: Employment contract, supply agreement

### The Key Insight: Formal-Relational Interaction

Formal and relational contracts can be:

#### 1. **Substitutes**
When formal contract improves, relational contract weakens:
- Better formal enforcement → less need for relationships
- **Example**: If courts enforce perfectly, don't need trust

#### 2. **Complements**  
When formal contract improves, relational contract strengthens:
- Formal contract creates future rents
- Those rents sustain relational contract
- **Example**: Ownership (formal) enables relationship-specific investment

## Critical Insights

> **Why this matters**: Explains why some firms integrate and others don't, even facing same technology. Answer: Different relationship strength. Also explains why partnerships work when theory says they shouldn't.

### Four Revolutionary Implications

#### 1. **Integration Is About Relationships, Not Just Property Rights**

Traditional (GHM):
$$\text{Integrate if:} \quad \Delta \text{Property Rights Value} > 0$$

BGM 2002:
$$\text{Integrate if:} \quad \Delta \text{Ownership} + \Delta \text{Relational Contract} > 0$$

**Key**: Ownership affects relational contract strength!

#### 2. **Non-Integration Can Be Efficient**

Even with hold-up problem, if:
- Relational contract strong enough
- Creates sufficient future rents
→ **No need to integrate**

**Example**: Toyota and suppliers—long-term relationships substitute for integration

#### 3. **"Too Close" Can Hurt**

Sometimes integration **weakens** relational contracts:
- Integration removes supplier's outside option
- Reduces future rents
- **Makes relational contract harder to sustain**

**Paradox**: Integration solves hold-up but creates new problems

#### 4. **Path Dependence in Boundaries**

History matters:
- If started with good relationship → stay non-integrated
- If started with weak relationship → integrate
- **Both can be equilibria** with same fundamentals

## Mathematical Framework

### Relational Contract Sustainability

Relational contract can enforce action $a$ if:
$$\frac{\delta}{1-\delta} \cdot \text{(Joint future rents)} \geq \text{Gain from deviation}$$

Where:
- $\delta$: Discount factor (patience)
- Joint future rents: Value of continuing relationship
- Gain from deviation: Short-term benefit of cheating

### Ownership and Relational Contracts

Integration changes:
1. **Outside options** (usually reduces supplier's)
2. **Joint surplus** (may increase or decrease)  
3. **Ease of coordination** (may improve or worsen)

Effect on relational contract strength: **Ambiguous**!

### Three Cases

| Structure | Property Rights | Relational Contract | When Optimal |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Market** | Separate ownership | Strong RC needed | RC strong, complementarity low |
| **Integration** | Joint ownership | Less RC needed | RC weak, complementarity high |
| **Partnership** | Separate ownership | Very strong RC | RC very strong, asset specificity low |

## Connections

**Builds on**:
- [[📜coase37_nature]] - Transaction costs and integration
- [[📜williamson71_integration]] - Hold-up problem
- [[📜gh86_ownership]] - Property rights theory

**Extended by**:
- [[📜mm15_kenya_roses]] - Empirical test of relationship value
- [[📜mm21_rwanda_coffee]] - Competition and relational contracts
- [[📜blouin19_default]] - Strategic default in relationships

**Related to**:
- M1: Relational incentive contracts (Levin 2003)
- M4: Property rights and boundaries
- M6: Organizational capabilities and relationships

## Classic Examples

### 1. **Toyota Production System**
- Suppliers **not** owned by Toyota
- **But**: Long-term relationships, relationship-specific investments
- Relational contracts sustain cooperation
- Evidence: Survived 2011 earthquake through relationships

### 2. **Silicon Valley Networks**
- VC-entrepreneur relationships
- Not formal control (minority ownership)
- Relational contracts:
  - Future funding conditional on performance
  - Reputation in tight-knit community
- **Why it works**: High $\delta$ (repeated game)

### 3. **International Trade**
- Many cross-border relationships
- Weak formal contract enforcement (different legal systems)
- **Solution**: Relational contracts through:
  - Repeated transactions
  - Community enforcement
  - Third-party intermediaries

## Discussion Notes

From [[14.282 Organizational Economics]]:

**Key Design Question**:
> When should you integrate vs. rely on relational contracts?

**Factors favoring relational contracts**:
- High $\delta$ (patient players, frequent interaction)
- Observable actions (easier to condition on)
- Large future rents (valuable relationship)
- Competitive outside options (can walk away)

**Factors favoring integration**:
- Low $\delta$ (impatient, one-shot)
- Hard to observe actions
- Small future rents
- Lock-in (no outside options)

**Empirical Prediction**:
- Relational contracts more common in:
  - Dense business networks
  - Reputation-based industries
  - Long time horizons

## Questions for Further Research

1. How to measure relational contract strength empirically?
2. What happens when formal contracts get stronger? (Complements or substitutes?)
3. How do relational contracts evolve over time?
4. Role of intermediaries (e.g., trade associations)?
5. Can firms "invest" in relational capital? How?
6. What about three-party relationships (e.g., buyer-supplier-competitor)?

## Empirical Implications

**Testable predictions**:
1. Relationship-specific investments higher in long-term partnerships
2. Vertical integration less common in dense networks
3. Contract incompleteness doesn't always lead to integration
4. Ownership changes should affect trading patterns

**Evidence**:
- [[📜mm15_kenya_roses]]: Supply shocks hurt relationships
- [[📜mm21_rwanda_coffee]]: Competition undermines relational contracts
- [[📜boudreau24_osh]]: External enforcement complements relationships
