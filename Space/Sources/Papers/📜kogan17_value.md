# Technological Innovation, Resource Allocation, and Growth

## Summary
Develops KPSS measure of patent value based on stock market reactions to patent grants. Shows citation-weighted patent counts correlate with this value measure. However, methodology has limitations: half of measured returns are negative (converted to positive via transformation), and effect driven by small number of highly valuable, highly cited patents.

## Research Question
Can stock market reactions to patent announcements provide a measure of innovation value at the firm and economy level?

## Key Concepts

### KPSS Measure
Stock market excess returns in weeks around patent grant announcement. Assumes markets efficiently price innovation value.

### Transformation Issue
Negative returns (˜50% of observations) converted to positive values via arbitrary transformation, raising questions about what drives measured effect.

## Main Results

### Correlation with Citations
Patent value measure correlates with forward citations, suggesting citations capture some aspect of value.

### Concentration
Effect concentrated in small number of high-value, high-citation patents. Most patents show noisy/negative returns.

## Critical Insights

From [[scott23🛠️_econ_idea_innov_ent]]:

> **Critical**: While widely used, KPSS is likely driven by handful of exceptionally valuable patents. Most patent grants generate noise, not signal, in stock prices.

## Methodology

**Approach**: Event study of stock returns around patent grants
**Data**: USPTO patents matched to Compustat firms; stock return data
**Analysis**: Excess returns relative to market in announcement windows

## Connections

**Relates to**:
