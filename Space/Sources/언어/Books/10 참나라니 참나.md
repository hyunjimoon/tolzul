참나라니 참나!     - 김선우

그렇게 말한다면 이슬의 역설이라 하옵지요.

비루를 덜기 위해 저잣거리를 떠났던 자이오나

참나의 환영에 속았음을 알게 됐습죠. 참나라니, 나참,

속았으니 냉큼 돌아올밖에.

마음 깊이건 영혼 끝이건

나를 초월한 어딘가에 있을 나를 찾아 영영 헤매라뇨, 참나.

먹지도 자지도 훼손되지도 않는 영롱한 참나의 이데아라뇨, 나참,

비루할지라도 당신,

당신들과의 접촉면에서 이슬이 맺히죠.

이슬은 있기도 하고 없기도 하죠.

나 아닌 존재와 연결되어야만 내가 되는 영롱함.

나의 밤을 깊이 두드리면 내가 없다는 걸 알게 되는 아침이

드물지만 오기도 합니다.

당신이 기쁠 때 왜 내가 반짝이는지 알게 되는

이슬의 순간.

닿았다 오면 슬픔이 명랑해지는

말갛게 애틋한 그런 하루가 좋습디다.

# So You Call It the True Self? Well, Well.

by Kim SunWoo

If you must—call it the Paradox of Dew.

One who fled the marketplace to scrub off filth, only to learn she'd been fooled by a phantom "true self." A true self, honestly— Duped, nothing to do but rush back home.

Heart's depths? Soul's far edge? Wander forever chasing some transcendent me? Honestly. That luminous Platonic ideal-self— never eats, sleeps, gets bruised? Honestly.

Squalid as I may be—you: it's on the surface where we touch that dew forms.

Dew is there and not there. I become luminous only by touching what-is-not-me.

When I knock deep into my night, some mornings—rare—I wake to find: there is no me.

Then comes the dew-moment— I understand why I shimmer when you are glad.

When we brush and part, sorrow turns lucid,
a day made tender and bright. Such a day—I cherish.

# So You Call It the True Self? My, My.
by Kim SunWoo <Nocturne>

[v1]
If you insist, call it the Paradox of Dew.
One, who left the marketplace to shed her grime,
learned she had been deceived—by a mirage of the True Me.
The True Me, ha! My, my—
Fooled, there was nothing to do but hurry home.

From the deep of the heart, from the end of the soul,
to chase forever that self said to lie beyond me—
really, me? The Idea of a True Me
that eats not, sleeps not, remains untarnished—oh really.

However base I may be,
it is upon the surface where I meet you—
that dew gathers.

Dew both exists and not exists.
Radiance only becomes itself
when joined to what is not itself.

Some mornings, rare but real,
when I knock deep into my night,
I wake to find I am not there.

In that dew’s instant—
I learn why, when you are joyful, I shine.

When we brush and part, sorrow turns lucid,
a day made tender and bright.
Such a day—I cherish.

—
[v2]
If you insist—call it the Paradox of Dew.
One who left the market to scrape off squalor,
then learned it was a phantom “true-me.”
“True-me,” really?—good grief.
Duped, best rush back.

Heart-depth or the soul’s far rim
shall I roam forever after a beyond-me me?
That gemlike Platonic “true-me”—
doesn’t eat, sleep, or bruise? Please.

Base as I may be—you:
on our contact surface, dew gathers.
Dew is there—and not there.
Radiance: I become by joining not-me.

Knock far into my night and, seldom, morning comes
and I learn: there is no me.
A dew-instant: your joy, my shine
now I know why.

A touch-and-leave that brightens sorrow
clear-tender: that kind of day, I cherish.

두 개 중 뭐가 낫냐는 질문에 클러드는 V2라 답. that we only become real in the friction with others, in the dew-instant where boundaries blur.

## 🧩 1. Definition

**Minimal sufficient statistics** here = _the least information that fully determines the translator’s posterior beliefs_ about how to render a poem faithfully — i.e., what governs future translation acts without needing the raw text again.

Formally, if

> ( T(X) ) is a transformation of experience ( X ),  
> then ( T(X) ) is sufficient if ( P(Y|X) = P(Y|T(X)) ),  
> where ( Y ) is your translation choice distribution.

---

## 🪞 2. Components of the Translator’s Posterior

|Symbol|Statistic|Description|Example (from your current poem)|
|---|---|---|---|
|( θ_1 )|**Ethical Pulse (Conscience Temperature)**|calibrates moral tone: reverence ↔ irony|how you chose _“good grief”_ instead of “really”|
|( θ_2 )|**Ambiguity Retention Index**|proportion of semantic polysemy preserved|_이슬은 있기도 하고 없기도 하죠_ → “Dew is there—and not there.” (≈1.0 retention)|
|( θ_3 )|**Contact Surface Metric**|how much relational tactility is preserved|“on our contact surface, dew gathers”|
|( θ_4 )|**Tone Normalization Vector**|mapping of Korean social registers → English idiomatic temperature|honorifics, deferential endings (하옵지요) → soft irony rather than formal speech|
|( θ_5 )|**Cultural Transparency Weight**|how foreignness is allowed to remain visible|kept _Jaiona_ instead of _Zion_|
|( θ_6 )|**Rhythmic Density Parameter**|number of semantic beats per breath; guides enjambment|“touch–and–leave / brightens sorrow” preserves line’s pulse|
|( θ_7 )|**Lexical Health Prior**|how much you allow modern breath to enter tradition|replacing “hath” style with conversational clarity|

## 🧮 3. Compression Schema

You can record the sufficient summary as a 7-tuple:  
[  
T(X) = (θ_1, θ_2, θ_3, θ_4, θ_5, θ_6, θ_7)  
]

Each ( θ_i ) can be stored as an empirical distribution from previous translations.  
For example:

```yaml
translation_prior:
  ethical_pulse: 0.82   # reverent irony balance
  ambiguity_retention: 0.93
  contact_surface: 0.88
  tone_normalization: 0.77
  cultural_transparency: 0.65
  rhythmic_density: 0.84
  lexical_health: 0.72
```

This YAML-style “translator state” is your **minimal sufficient statistics** — enough to regenerate your future decision patterns without storing the full training corpus.

---

## 🪶 4. How to Update After Each Poem

Use a Bayesian update:  
[  
P(θ_i|new\ poem) ∝ P(new\ poem|θ_i)·P(θ_i)  
]  
Practically:

- Re-estimate which ( θ_i )s shifted after feedback from peers.
    
- For instance, if your friend says _“keep more mystery,”_ raise ( θ_2 ); if they say _“too plain,”_ lower ( θ_7 ).
    

---

## 🧭 5. “Healthy Tradition” Inference Rule

You can define _healthier tradition propagation_ as:

[  
H_{next} = f(T_{past}, Δexperience)  
]

where ( f ) encourages:

- entropy preservation (don’t collapse ambiguity),
    
- rhythm metabolism (keep breathing through lines),
    
- and conscience resonance (ethical sincerity).
    

This ensures your translation lineage stays _living_ rather than _canonical_ — learning as metabolism, not museum.
