# Zero to One

The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create.

## Key Concepts

**0 to 1 vs 1 to n**
- Horizontal progress (1 to n): Globalization - copying things that work
- Vertical progress (0 to 1): Technology - doing new things

**Four Essential Characteristics of a Monopoly:**
1. Proprietary technology (10x better than closest substitute)
2. Network effects
3. Economies of scale
4. Branding

**Last Mover Advantage**
It's better to be the last mover - to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years of monopoly profits.

**Distribution Matters More Than Product**
Poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business.
