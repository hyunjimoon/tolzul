## Detailed Elaboration

### 1. Problem

The problem is that entrepreneurs design experiments that maximize the probability of positive results rather than maximizing information value. This creates market inefficiencies where:

- Ventures with non-viable technologies receive funding due to uninformative experiments
- Ventures with viable technologies may not receive funding because investors discount experiment results
- In extreme cases, markets completely fail when the potential for uninformative experiments becomes too large

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

**2.1 Nature of the Problem**

- The fundamental issue is asymmetric payoffs. Entrepreneurs receive private benefits Z from continued work on the venture regardless of ultimate success.
- This creates a natural incentive to design experiments with high false positive rates (low s₂) to maximize the probability of continuation.
- Mathematically: Entrepreneurs maximize p₀s₁(1-α)V + [p₀s₁ + (1-p₀)(1-s₂)]Z, which decreases with s₂.

**2.2 Individual Factors**

- Entrepreneurs cannot perfectly predict how investors will respond to different experiment designs.
- This prediction uncertainty is captured by function P_E(a_I|s₁,s₂) with error ε_E.
- Similarly, investors cannot perfectly predict what experiment design entrepreneurs have chosen, represented by function P_I(s₁,s₂) with error ε_I.
- These prediction errors lead to suboptimal decisions by both parties.

**2.3 Institutional Factors**

- No established mechanisms exist for credibly certifying experiment informativeness.
- Standard incentive contracts (e.g., equity stakes) fail to resolve this moral hazard.
- Lack of standardized protocols for experiment design in emerging technologies.

### 3. Solution

**3.1 Formalize Prediction Functions**

- Define entrepreneur's prediction of investor action: P_E(a_I|s₁,s₂)
- Define investor's prediction of experiment design: P_I(s₁,s₂)
- Quantify prediction errors: ε_E and ε_I

**3.2 Quantify Impact of Prediction Errors**

- Prove that welfare loss is proportional to prediction errors: W_loss ∝ ε_I + ε_E
- Show that as prediction errors decrease, experiment informativeness increases
- Demonstrate that beyond a threshold of prediction accuracy, market failure is avoided

**3.3 University Certification**

- Universities validate experiment designs by certifying minimum s₂ values
- This reduces investor prediction error to near zero for the sensitivity parameter
- Entrepreneurs can more accurately predict investor responses to validated experiments

### 4. How Solution Addresses Root Causes

University certification addresses all three root causes:

- **Nature**: While private benefits remain, certification constrains the entrepreneur's ability to exploit them through uninformative experiments
- **Individual**: Reduces prediction errors for both parties, enabling better decision-making
- **Institutional**: Creates a credible third-party mechanism that both sides can rely on

The key mathematical insight is that with university certification, the entrepreneur's optimization problem changes from:

```
max U_E = p₀s₁(1-α)V + [p₀s₁ + (1-p₀)(1-s₂)]Z
```

to:

```
max U_E = P(funding|s₁,s₂) × [p₀s₁(1-α)V + Z]
```

Where P(funding|s₁,s₂) increases with s₂ when experiments are certified, creating incentives for more informative experiments.
