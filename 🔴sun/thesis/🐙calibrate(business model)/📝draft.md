Business Model Prior Calibration: A Theoretical Framework for Action-Oriented Belief Encoding Paradigmatic Innovation in Bayesian Decision Theory The proposed framework of "Business Model Prior Calibration" represents a fundamental reconceptualization of Bayesian inference in entrepreneurial contexts. By treating prior distributions as action-oriented encodings rather than epistemic states, this approach resolves the theoretical tension between optimization and belief formation while maintaining mathematical coherence."

AS-IS: $\underset{ϕ}{min} E[Cost] = g(ϕ)=C⋅P(S=1,D=0∣ϕ)−V⋅P(S=1,D=1∣ϕ)=Cϕ2−Vϕ(1−ϕ)$
 founder knows exactly what one should promise $\phi$ which implies founder isn't learning anything from the experiment which beats the purpose of experiment in most cases

TO-BE:
$\underset{a,b}{min} E[Cost] = \int g(ϕ) P(ϕ) dϕ$ where $ϕ \sim Beta(a,b)$

founder minimize expected cost given one's prior of promise level. prior becomes decision variable, meaning founder choose what and how one should be uncertain about, rather than optimizing given exogenous uncertainty. main goal is to separate existing confusion on prior and belief. As such, we define prior as action-oriented encoding of belief and show how environment's cost parameter of action to sell then deliver promise affects the optimal prior on promise level. Using our framework, founder can calibrate prior distribution on their promise level before promising. This calibration is formulated as optimization problem where the founder minimize the expected cost using marginalized likelihood of sell or buy event which is environment's reaction to one's promise. This process of calibrating one's prior using simulated prior update helps founder become more flexible in their business modeling. 

this means the EVENT PROBABILITY P(S=1, D=0) is marginalized likelihood which is calculated by founder as weighted average of P(S=1, D=0|phi) using one's prior p(phi). likewise, from founder's perspective, event probability P(S=1, D=1) is marginalizing P(S=1, D=0|phi) over the weight p(phi) as founder will choose this promise level distribution to create uncertainty which its environment will react to. we derive P(S=1, D=0) = Beta(a+2, b)/Beta(a, b) and P(S=1, D=1) = Beta(a+1, b+1)/Beta(a, b). Note Beta(a, b+1) + Beta(a+2, b) + Beta(a+1, b+1) = Beta(a, b), proving the probability of three events adds up to one.
