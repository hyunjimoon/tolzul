## Operations Research Papers: Newsvendor Problems and Supply Chain Trust

### 1. Khouja (1999) - "The single-period (news-vendor) problem: literature review and suggestions for future research"

**Abstract:** "The single-period problem (SPP), also known as the newsboy or news-vendor problem, is to find the order quantity which maximizes the expected profit in a single period probabilistic demand framework. Interest in the SPP remains unabated and many extensions to it have been proposed in the last decade. These extensions include dealing with different objectives and utility functions, different supplier pricing policies, different news-vendor pricing policies and discounting structures, different states of information about demand, constrained multi-products, multiple-products with substitution, random yields, and multi-location models. This paper builds a taxonomy of the SPP literature and delineates the contribution of the different SPP extensions. This paper also suggests some future directions for research."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** The newsvendor framework provides a fundamental model for entrepreneurial decision-making under demand uncertainty. Entrepreneurs face similar trade-offs between over-promising (excess inventory) and under-promising (lost sales), requiring careful calibration across multiple dimensions including pricing, resource constraints, and market segments.

### 2. Schweitzer & Cachon (2000) - "Decision bias in the newsvendor problem with a known demand distribution"

**Abstract:** "In the newsvendor problem a decision maker orders inventory before a one period selling season with stochastic demand. If too much is ordered, stock is left over at the end of the period, whereas if too little is ordered, sales are lost. The expected profit-maximizing order quantity is well known, but little is known about how managers actually make these decisions. We describe two experiments that investigate newsvendor decisions across different profit conditions. Results from these studies demonstrate that choices systematically deviate from those that maximize expected profit. Subjects order too few of high-profit products and too many of low-profit products. These results are not consistent with risk-aversion, risk-seeking preferences, Prospect Theory preferences, waste aversion, stockout aversion, or the consequences of underestimating opportunity costs. Two explanations are consistent with the data. One, subjects behave as if their utility function incorporates a preference to reduce ex-post inventory error, the absolute difference between chosen quantity and realized demand. Two, subjects suffer from the anchoring and insufficient adjustment bias."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** This paper reveals critical biases—entrepreneurs systematically under-commit to high-potential opportunities while over-committing to marginal ones. The documented anchoring bias and preference for minimizing ex-post error suggest entrepreneurs need systematic processes to counteract conservative promise-setting, especially for high-value opportunities.

### 3. Cachon & Lariviere (2001) - "Contracting to assure supply: How to share demand forecasts in a supply chain"

**Abstract:** "Forecast sharing is studied in a supply chain with a manufacturer that faces stochastic demand for a single product and a supplier that is the sole source for a critical component. The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract, the supplier constructs capacity (if he accepts the contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** The paper demonstrates how information asymmetry creates incentives to inflate forecasts, directly paralleling how entrepreneurs might exaggerate projections to attract resources. Contract design and verification mechanisms become crucial for enabling truthful promise-making and building stakeholder trust.

### 4. Özer, Zheng & Chen (2011) - "Trust in forecast information sharing"

**Abstract:** "This paper investigates the capacity investment decision of a supplier who solicits private forecast information from a manufacturer. To ensure abundant supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her forecast in a costless, non-binding, and non-verifiable type of communication known as 'cheap talk.' According to standard game theory, parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative -- the manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier does not use the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in controlled laboratory experiments that parties cooperate even in the absence of reputation-building mechanisms and complex contracts. We argue that the underlying reason for cooperation is trust."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** Despite theoretical predictions of non-cooperation, real-world actors often share information truthfully based on trust. This behavioral insight suggests that building trust relationships may be as important as formal contracts in enabling realistic entrepreneurial promise calibration. Trust levels vary with investment stakes and risk exposure.

## Entrepreneurship Theory Papers

### 5. Shane & Venkataraman (2000) - "The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research"

**Abstract:** "To date, the phenomenon of entrepreneurship has lacked a conceptual framework. In this note we draw upon previous research conducted in the different social science disciplines and applied fields of business to create a conceptual framework for the field. With this framework we explain a set of empirical phenomena and predict a set of outcomes not explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other fields."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** The paper establishes entrepreneurship as the nexus of individual and opportunity, where opportunities are objective but their recognition is subjective. Information asymmetries and different cognitive frameworks lead to varied opportunity assessments. The definition of opportunities as situations where new offerings can be sold above production costs provides a concrete threshold for promise calibration.

### 6. Baron (1998) - "Cognitive mechanisms in entrepreneurship: Why and when entrepreneurs think differently than other people"

**Abstract:** "Because of their importance in creating wealth—both personal and societal—entrepreneurs have long been the subject of intensive study. Past research has focused on important issues such as: Why do some people, but not others, recognize or create new opportunities? Why do some, but not others, try to convert their ideas and dreams into business ventures? And why, ultimately, are some entrepreneurs successful and others not? Efforts to answer these questions in terms of the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs generally yielded disappointing results: contrary to what informal observation suggests, entrepreneurs do not appear to differ greatly from nonentrepreneurs with respect to various aspects of personality. As a result, a growing number of researchers have recently adopted a different approach—one emphasizing the role of cognitive processes in entrepreneurship. Whereas informative research has already been conducted within this framework, the present study seeks to expand this developing perspective by building additional conceptual bridges between entrepreneurship research and the large, extant literature on human cognition. Basic research on human cognition suggests that our cognitive processes are far from totally rational; in fact, our thinking is often influenced by a number of sources of potential bias and error. It is suggested here that entrepreneurs often work in situations and under conditions that would be expected to maximize the impact of such factors. Specifically, they face situations that tend to overload their information-processing capacity and are characterized by high levels of uncertainty, novelty, emotion, and time pressure. Together, these factors may increase entrepreneurs' susceptibility to a number of cognitive biases."

**Key insights for promise calibration:** Baron identifies five cognitive mechanisms affecting entrepreneurial thinking: counterfactual thinking, affect infusion, attributional style, planning fallacy, and self-justification. The conditions entrepreneurs face—uncertainty, novelty, emotion, and time pressure—amplify these biases, making systematic promise calibration frameworks essential.

## Synthesis for Business Model Calibration Framework

These six papers collectively provide a robust foundation for understanding entrepreneurial promise calibration:

**From operations research**, we learn that decision-makers systematically deviate from optimal choices, exhibiting predictable biases when facing uncertainty. The newsvendor framework offers a quantitative model for balancing over- and under-commitment, while the supply chain papers reveal how trust and contract design can enable or inhibit truthful information sharing.

**From entrepreneurship theory**, we understand that entrepreneurs operate under conditions that amplify cognitive biases, while possessing unique information that enables opportunity recognition. The objective nature of opportunities combined with subjective evaluation processes creates systematic calibration challenges.

**For practical application**, a business model calibration framework should incorporate:

1. Bias correction mechanisms to counteract the tendency to under-promise on high-value opportunities
2. Trust-building processes alongside formal verification structures
3. Multi-scenario analysis to move beyond anchoring biases
4. Recognition that entrepreneurial conditions (uncertainty, time pressure, emotion) require special calibration approaches
5. Clear thresholds for what constitutes a viable opportunity (revenue exceeding costs)

This integrated perspective suggests that effective entrepreneurial promise calibration requires both analytical frameworks and behavioral understanding, with explicit mechanisms to address the systematic biases documented across these research streams.
