# 📜🐙_Khouja99_🗞️ - Newsvendor Framework for Promise Calibration

## Citation
Khouja, M. (1999). The single-period (news-vendor) problem: literature review and suggestions for future research. *Omega*, 27(5), 537-553.

## Core Insight for BMC
The critical ratio Cu/(Co+Cu) determines optimal inventory—analogously, V/C ratio determines optimal promise uncertainty Beta(a,b).

## Key Extensions Relevant to Entrepreneurs
1. **Multiple products with substitution** → Multiple promise options entrepreneurs present to investors
2. **Random yields** → Uncertain delivery capability given promise level
3. **Different supplier pricing policies** → How VCs price deals based on promise boldness

## Connection Points
- **Traditional**: Optimize inventory q given demand distribution
- **BMC**: Optimize prior (a,b) given market response functions
- **Bridge**: Both balance underage (missed opportunity) vs overage (failed delivery) costs

## Teaching Example
"Just as newsvendors order newspapers before knowing demand, entrepreneurs set promise levels before knowing capability. The math is identical—only the decision variable changes from quantity to uncertainty structure."
