**üëæ Alienate (Scott Stern)**: Entrepreneurs rationally choose bold promises because underpromise cost Cu strikes immediately while overpromise cost Co arrives discounted by Œ¥^T. What appears as overconfidence reflects optimal response to temporal asymmetry where being forgotten costs more than failing famously.

**üê¢ Deliberate (Moshe Ben-Akiva)**: Promise level œÜ creates threshold response functions where P(Sell|œÜ) = œÜ determines market acceptance. Each entrepreneur's promise shifts collective expectations, transforming individual choices into tomorrow's market constraints.

**üêÖ Generate (Vikash Mansinghka)**: Market feedback generates learning dynamics where selling without delivery updates beliefs to Beta(3,1), reinforcing bold promises. Success with delivery yields Beta(2,2), creating population heterogeneity from identical starting conditions.

**üêô Calibrate (Charlie Fine)**: Promises construct operational capabilities through endogenous feedback‚Äîbold promises attract resources that improve P(Deliver|œÜ). The promise-capability relationship inverts traditional sequencing where capabilities precede commitments.

a_supply: getting acceptance from my committe members with four evaluation (üìêproduction (perception module [1], action module [2]) üì¶delivery (teaching operations for entrepreneurship [3], teaching strategy for entrepreneurship [4]))
a_demand: find demand side stakeholder that can help me design "perception" module (sec.2.1) e.g. DAERO (ÎåÄÎ°ú?)

a_supply is scheduled this thursday (my thesis proposal to a committee of two supply side stakeholders group:
who'd test four aspects) where i designed committee members with diverse evaluation function: charlie fine (ent.ops), scott stern (ent.strat), vikash mansinghka (probabilistic program + serial entrepreneur), moshe benakiva (STATS)

### five abstracts -> three abstracts
motivation: [[exchanging influence with investment]]: making five versions of abstract that each leverages the optimism of each professors - think of this as selfish gene logic where human's nature is to desire for influence (whether biological or spiritual) and invest money, time, effort to satisfy that desire. i.e. my business model is to create and capture value using optimism of the five professors. several success examples is implementing the advice of mentor/investors have increase the startup quality as measured by one research using creative destruction lab venture accelerator database (description attached). using charlie's advice - you want others to feel excited about your research, and the recipe for others to get excited about something is, first find a shared vision (as you go up the ladder of abstraction, you can find shared vision with everyone e.g. from optimism of small scope like entrepreneurship to bigger scope of world peace). then given the shared vision, help them understand what they can contribute to they would find a "how" themselves.

1. logging disagreeed -> persuaded
2. predictability of their reaction (experiencing the surprise in advance)

For an EV startup founder, engaging with a diverse array of advisors is crucial for refining their understanding of the complex landscape they navigate. Each conversation sheds light on different facets‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the trajectory of battery technology, the expansion of charging infrastructure, evolving regulatory policies, or patterns in customer adoption. While no single piece of advice may perfectly align with the founder

"Causal Complexity in Entrepreneurial Learning: Bridging Bayesian and Evolutionary Approaches"<br><br> 2. "Probabilistic Reasoning for Entrepreneurial Decision Support: A Human-AI Collaboration Framework" | This project explores the intersection of entrepreneurial learning and decision-making processes. The first paper develops a Bayesian framework that integrates strategic and operational decision-making in entrepreneurial contexts. The second paper investigates the causal complexity in entrepreneurial learning, synthesizing Bayesian and evolutionary learning approaches.

### 2024 Aug
I met with vikash, charlie said he'd reply to vikash (but not sure he has yet)
moving from compete to collaborate 


f \in F1 vs F2 (F1 < F2)
f(x) - f(x*)

conditional distribution can be competed - cost of commiting to competition?
given that we committed to execution (me): 
given that we committed to control (vikash): 



![[Pasted image 20240410094259.png|200]]
Based on my interaction with each of you, I think we'd make a lovely organization with Artist Scott, judge Charlie, scientist Vikash (from [[Cronin_SAJ.pdf]])

###  2024 July
Last Tuesday Vikash said he can only fund research that¬†is¬†directly¬†aligned with his lab's vision. Not to scare him away, I shared how responsible you have been about my funding and said funding is not my primary goal of¬†approaching him. Without financial constraints, Vikash became more open. We brainstormed how to develop a meditech case and he asked me to deliver meditech's summary by Wednesday so that we can have deeper conversations on Thursday dinner. I stayed up all Tuesday night & Wednesday to deliver¬†[this slide](https://streaklinks.com/CAehYSu6OtoljFIjTwKtMxuV/https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fpresentation%2Fd%2F1cR9QJXT2lSE8OQKO2m9x8KmbTM9LsbBLk4MPNRFKcw0%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing?email=hyunji.moonb%40gmail.com), which Vikash was satisfied with.

During Thursday dinner, I met Joshua Tenenbaum (Vikash's advisor) and asked for advice on planning to reach my goal - bridging CHI (Josh and Vikash's¬†[Focused Research Organizations](https://streaklinks.com/CAehYSugIFEqpSaUgwJHiPLJ/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schmidtfutures.org%2Fschmidt-futures-and-ken-griffin-commit-50-million-to-support-the-next-big-breakthroughs-in-science%2F?email=hyunji.moonb%40gmail.com)) and Bayesian Entrepreneurship. I shared my hardship in eliciting¬†active¬†support from you or Vikash due to my lack of communication skill.¬†
He was interested in Bayesian Entrepreneurship and shared his theory on why Vikash might be interested in my research: Reid Hoffman and¬†[David Siegel](https://streaklinks.com/CAehYTTqqjdG6deqYwXcDy0d/https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDavid_Siegel_%28computer_scientist%29?email=hyunji.moonb%40gmail.com)¬†are important CHI's¬†funders (for AGI) so the business use case¬†of CHI's technology would be valuable. Joshua and Vikash have been discussing game theoretic multi agent business strategy tools, which I think would be an extension of tug of war (p.13) from CHI's¬†[architecture paper](https://streaklinks.com/CAehYSupaaxu4bxgLwnOAkTE/https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2306.12672?email=hyunji.moonb%40gmail.com)¬†(From Word Models to World Models). Joshua advised connecting these dots for you +¬† having you and Vikash to have a brief chat would be helpful.

After carefully sharing Joshua's advice with Vikash, he thankfully updated his mode of help and gave¬†more actionable advice. We brainstormed how to pitch this project to you. Attached is my first draft which Vikash offered to revise before sharing with you. I'm waiting for his feedback.
 
[[ai accountant - pitch to charlie (with vikash's help).pdf]] with case2 on  [[üåôamoon()/üí≠ theorize/üåôthesis/M1_üìêMeaningful innovation measure/üëìevaluating/üí∏(üìê) Evaluate/üó∫Ô∏èexplain(üìê)/üéçpivot_game/case2_pivoting|case2_pivoting]] and [[üåôamoon()/üí≠ theorize/üåôthesis/M1_üìêMeaningful innovation measure/üëìevaluating/üí∏(üìê) Evaluate/üß≠predict(üìê)/case2_pivoting|case2_pivoting]]

charlie's reaction to our `ai accountant project`¬†was being clear on ‚Äúwho is proposing what to whom and what we all hope to contribute and accomplish?‚Äù to choose my doctoral committee member. This requires probabilistic reasoning on  

- why¬†`Vikash`¬†is interested in my research (`joshua`¬† shared important CHI investors are entrepreneurs, so business application can be valuable)
- what¬†`Charlie`¬†meant when he said ‚Äúcan¬†`Vikash`¬†partially fund you‚Äù?
- can¬†`Scott (theorist)`¬†be a reliable distribution channel for our research to entrepreneurship community, than¬†`Bill (practitioner, director of martin trust center)`?

### Before 2024 summer

Gerpott (2005) and Brem and Voigt (2008) reported high and low ‚Äònewness‚Äô of the innovation and thus between radical innovations (‚Äòtechnology push‚Äô) and incremental innovations (‚Äòmarket pull‚Äô)

- CONTRANIAN dynamics e.g. no is more informative than yes, can have clearer goal in infecting majority with idea; persuasion -> BRIDGING dynamics (higher quantity leading to higher quantity (Terweich 2015) - evolutionary)
- M3S DIRL team didn't have plans on interpretability. incremental research. 
- angie is betting on charlie's clockspeed and gear model, scott's innovation ecosystem and bayesian entrepreneurship, vikash's probablistic programming language architecture, starting with `ai accountant`  product

#### 2.  PhD goals 
- persuasion between tribes with different language and tool - contributed to convergence of `connectionist`, `symbolist`, `bayesian`
- connectionists, symbolists are being combined on top of Bayesian (as was predicted in the book). Analogizes (learning with kernel; Fourier) and evolutionaries (algorithmic reasoning) are in line to be unified. 
- experience science of scale: need homogenous and visionary organization to scale 
- smooth connection of inference and decision
- stan tribe likes code, sd tribe likes diagram
- probabilistic programming for two markets: i) entrepreneurship education, ii) startup
