## Harmonic Principles

1. **Consecution**: Each node creates tension that pulls toward the next
2. **Balance**: Temporal (⏰) and spatial (↕️) dimensions interweave throughout
3. **Resolution**: Each movement resolves its tension while setting up the next
4. **Unity**: The promise formula q* = ln[(2Cu+V)/(2Co+V)]/μ emerges as the harmonic center

## Example Transitions

> **Line 2 (🟣→♻️)**: "These multiplicative complexity increases—temporal asymmetry, spatial explosion, and discrete value—reveal why classical models fail catastrophically in entrepreneurial contexts."

> **Line 5 (♻️→🟧)**: "These three gaps—temporal inversion, spatial discretization, and endogenous interaction—demand new mathematical frameworks that capture how promises shape their own fulfillment."

> **Line 7 (🟧→🔴)**: "This context-dependent value modulation provides precise prescriptions for promise calibration across venture lifecycles and industry clockspeeds."
