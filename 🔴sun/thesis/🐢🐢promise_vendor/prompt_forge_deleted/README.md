# Prompt Forge - README

## 🎯 Purpose
A systematic approach to crafting and refining prompts that honor Joe Moran's sentence principles while generating content for the Promise Vendor project.

```

## 🏃 Quick Start

1. Read `🚀quick_start.md` for an example prompt
2. Deploy to Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini simultaneously  
3. Evaluate responses using `📊evaluation_tracker.md`
4. Identify 3 holes using `🔄iteration_protocol.md`
5. Update `💡master_prompt_template.md`
6. Repeat until prose flows like water

## 🎻 Core Principles (via Moran)

1. **Consecution**: Each sentence ends with a door ajar
2. **Gift Economy**: Brevity that respects reader's time
3. **Verb Vitality**: Actions over abstractions
4. **Plain Vessels**: Simple words carry wild ideas
5. **Rhythm Variance**: Mix short. Let longer sentences unfold their meaning across a broader canvas. Stop.

## 📏 Success Metrics

- **Flow Test**: Can sentences be reordered? (Bad)
- **Trim Test**: Does cutting 15% hurt? (Good)  
- **Verb Test**: Active verbs > Abstract nouns
- **Gift Test**: Value per sentence > 1

## 🔄 Iteration Philosophy

Each cycle reveals new gaps. The master prompt evolves through:
- Cross-platform stress testing
- Pattern recognition across AI responses
- Systematic hole identification
- Incremental refinement

The goal: A prompt that reliably generates Moran-worthy prose across any AI platform.

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding iterations:
1. Create new folder: `iterations/iteration_XXX/`
2. Save all three AI responses
3. Complete evaluation tracker
4. Document holes found
5. Update master prompt
6. Note learnings in meta-log

*Remember: "A writer's primary labour is the single sentence."*
