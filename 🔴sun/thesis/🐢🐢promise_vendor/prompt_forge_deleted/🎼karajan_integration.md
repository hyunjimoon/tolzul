# üéº Prompt Forge Integration

## Connection to Karajan üê¢üê¢promise vendor.md

This prompt iteration system serves as the **sentence-level quality control** for the Promise Vendor project.

## How Prompt Forge Supports Promise Vendor

1. **Consecution Engineering**: Ensures each promise flows naturally to the next
2. **Verb Vitality**: Transforms static promises into active commitments  
3. **Gift Economy**: Makes each vendor interaction valuable, not taxing
4. **Uncertainty Navigation**: Uses Bayesian framing in plain language

## Integration Workflow

1. **Input from Karajan**: Identify key concepts needing translation
2. **Process in Prompt Forge**: Iterate until Moran principles satisfied
3. **Output to Promise Vendor**: Deploy refined language in main project

## Key Synchronization Points

- When Karajan identifies "variations in belief state" ‚Üí Prompt Forge creates consecuted explanations
- When Karajan needs "Clockspeed Coordinates" ‚Üí Prompt Forge varies rhythm to match
- When Karajan surfaces complexity ‚Üí Prompt Forge anchors in plain vessels

## Success Metrics

Promise Vendor prose succeeds when:
- Entrepreneurs read without friction (consecution)
- Complex Bayesian concepts feel intuitive (plain vessel)
- Each section ends leaving readers wanting more (gift economy)
- The rhythm matches the uncertainty being navigated (varied sentences)

## Remember Moran's Test

Can you print any Promise Vendor section, draw boxes around sentences, and reorder them?
- If YES: Needs more consecution work in Prompt Forge
- If NO: The invisible thread is working

*"Every sentence is a gift‚Äîbrief, proportionate, courteous."*
