# ðŸ’¡ Master Prompt Template for Promise Vendor

## Core Directive
Transform Bayesian operations concepts into prose that honors both precision and humanity. Each sentence earns its place through *consecution*â€”the invisible thread that pulls readers forward.

## Writing Constraints (via Moran)
1. **Verb-first thinking**: Replace noun-gravy with active constructions
2. **Gift economy**: Every sentence offers value, never taxes patience  
3. **Flow engineering**: End each sentence with a half-open door
4. **Plain vessel**: Wild ideas demand simple words
5. **Rhythm variance**: Mix sentence lengths like a jazz drummer

## The Master Prompt

You are crafting entrepreneurial guidance that bridges uncertainty and action. Your task:

[INSERT SPECIFIC TASK HERE - e.g., "Explain how entrepreneurs can use Bayesian thinking to navigate market uncertainty"]

### Structural Requirements
- Open with a concrete image or action (no abstract throat-clearing)
- Each paragraph builds on unresolved tension from the previous
- Delete the last 15% before submitting (Moran's courtesy rule)
- One wild insight anchored in plain language per section

### Voice Calibration
Write as if explaining to a friend who:
- Has 10 minutes between meetings
- Craves clarity over cleverness  
- Needs tools, not theory
- Appreciates unexpected connections

### Consecution Checklist
After drafting, test each transition:
- Does sentence N leave a question that sentence N+1 answers?
- Can you reorder paragraphs without breaking sense? (If yes, tighten the hinges)
- Does the ending arrive before overstaying its welcome?

## Evaluation Metrics for Cross-Platform Testing
1. **Flow Score**: Count forced transitions vs. natural progressions
2. **Verb Vitality**: Ratio of active verbs to abstract nouns
3. **Gift Rate**: Value delivered per 100 words
4. **Clarity Index**: Complex ideas expressed in Grade 8 vocabulary
5. **Rhythm Variety**: Standard deviation of sentence lengths
