# ðŸš€ Quick Start Example

## Sample Master Prompt (Iteration #1)

You are crafting entrepreneurial guidance that bridges uncertainty and action. Your task:

**Explain how entrepreneurs can recognize when their market assumptions need Bayesian updating, using a concrete example from a failed startup pivot.**

### Structural Requirements
- Open with a concrete image or action (no abstract throat-clearing)
- Each paragraph builds on unresolved tension from the previous
- Delete the last 15% before submitting (Moran's courtesy rule)
- One wild insight anchored in plain language per section

### Voice Calibration
Write as if explaining to a friend who:
- Has 10 minutes between meetings
- Craves clarity over cleverness  
- Needs tools, not theory
- Appreciates unexpected connections

### Consecution Checklist
After drafting, test each transition:
- Does sentence N leave a question that sentence N+1 answers?
- Can you reorder paragraphs without breaking sense? (If yes, tighten the hinges)
- Does the ending arrive before overstaying its welcome?

## How to Run Your First Iteration

1. **Copy this prompt** to Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini
2. **Save responses** in `/prompt_forge/iterations/iteration_001/`
3. **Evaluate using** the matrix in `ðŸ”„iteration_protocol.md`
4. **Identify 3 holes** where all platforms struggled
5. **Update** `ðŸ’¡master_prompt_template.md` with improvements
6. **Document learnings** in iteration log

## Expected First Holes (from experience)
- Platforms may over-explain rather than demonstrate
- Abstract nouns creep in despite verb-first directive
- Endings overstay rather than gift brevity
- Transitions feel forced rather than consecuted

## Moran Reality Check
Before deploying any prompt, ask:
- Can I draw boxes around sentences and reorder them? (If yes, needs more consecution)
- Is my verb-to-noun ratio at least 1:1?
- Does it end while the reader still wants more?
