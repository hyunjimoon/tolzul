| [[🟣alert]] | 🟣0          | **Entrepreneurs' overpromise phenomenon**                   | **Point**: Winners systematically overpromise—not from bias but hidden rationality. **Evidence**: Jobs promised 1,000 songs in your pocket when flash memory cost $400/GB; Musk promised sub-$35k EVs when batteries cost $1,000/kWh. **Explanation**: These successful entrepreneurs understood that bold promises attract resources despite technical uncertainties, suggesting overpromising serves a rational function in resource acquisition. **Transition**: This rationality emerges from a fundamental asymmetry in entrepreneurial costs.                                                                                                                                                         |
|             | 🟣⏰          | **Promise-now-deliver-later inflates underage cost**        | **Point**: Future commitments create asymmetric costs: immediate unfunded death (Cu) vs delayed funded failure (Co). **Evidence**: IT startups face winner-takes-all dynamics where Co << Cu, while SpaceX safety concerns make Co >> Cu. **Explanation**: The promise creates a time gap that delays "time to death," making underage cost (dying unfunded now) more painful than overage cost (failing to deliver later), especially when future value V and discount rates can mitigate later costs. **Transition**: This time asymmetry interacts with entrepreneurs' ability to manipulate time itself through speed.                                                                                  |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️        | **Create value V by adding random variables F,D\|P**        | **Point**: Entrepreneurs expand value by introducing new uncertainties—funded probability F and delivery probability D given promise P. **Evidence**: Tesla's promise of luxury EVs created new state variables (luxury + electric) that didn't exist in traditional automotive categories. **Explanation**: Value creation isn't just optimization within known parameters but expanding the state space itself, transforming simple inventory decisions into multidimensional promise optimization where PF(P) and PD(P) become the new decision landscape. **Transition**: Speed becomes crucial when navigating this expanded state space.                                                              |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️⏰       | **Move μ times faster**                                     | **Point**: Fast-clockspeed ventures face amplified promise pressures through higher discount rates. **Evidence**: Entrepreneurs who "live 48 hours in one day" effectively double their discount rate compared to those living normal 24-hour days. **Explanation**: Moving μ times faster increases the discount rate, which amplifies the asymmetric cost gap—making the immediate underage cost feel even larger relative to future overage costs, naturally pushing toward bolder promises. **Transition**: Yet this sprint through time can be complicated by spatial expansion.                                                                                                                       |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️⏰↕️     | **Expanding state space may drag sprint**                   | **Point**: Creating new market categories slows execution while demanding bolder promises. **Evidence**: New variables F, D, and μ create combinatorial overload—each new dimension multiplies complexity. **Explanation**: The pursuit of opportunity "without regard to resources currently controlled" has both temporal (what I have now vs later) and spatial (expanding opportunity space) components, where spatial expansion may paradoxically slow the very sprint that justified bold promises. **Transition**: These alert signals demand a deeper dig into the promise mechanism.                                                                                                               |
| [[♻️dig]]   | ♻️0          | **Entrepreneur's promise**                                  | **Point**: The promise level P becomes the core decision variable—pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled. **Evidence**: Unlike traditional operations that optimize known variables, entrepreneurs optimize the promise itself. **Explanation**: This definition uniquely captures both time (resources now vs later) and space (opportunity expansion) dimensions, making the promise P the central lever for bridging current constraints with future possibilities. **Transition**: This promise creates specific cost dynamics that shape rational behavior.                                                                                                           |
|             | ♻️⏰(🟣⏰)     | **Provocative promise may fuel funding and delay delivery** | **Point**: Bold promises attract capital Co·PF(1-PD) but risk unfunded death Cu·(1-PF)PD. **Evidence**: Promise vendor optimizes promise level P for uncertain delivery capability D—inverting newsvendor's inventory Q for uncertain demand D. **Explanation**: Increasing promise level increases overage cost Co·PF(1-PD) but decreases underage cost Cu·(1-PF)PD, creating a fundamental tradeoff where provocative promises may fuel funding while delaying delivery, with asymmetric costs tilting toward boldness when Cu > Co. **Transition**: This cost structure interacts with value creation mechanisms.                                                                                        |
|             | ♻️⏰↕️(🟣⏰↕️) | **Promise parameterizes value: V·PF(P)·PD(P), min_P C-V**   | **Point**: Value creation depends on promise-sensitive probabilities—optimize total cost minus value. **Evidence**: E[π] = Co·PF(P)·[1-PD(P)] - Cu·[1-PF(P)]·PD(P) - V·PF(P)·PD(P) introduces value V conditional on both funding and delivery. **Explanation**: The promise P parameterizes both funding probability PF(P) and delivery probability PD(P), where increased promise increases funding feasibility but may decrease delivery probability, creating a rich optimization landscape C - V. **Transition**: Certain feedback dynamics lie outside our current scope.                                                                                                                             |
|             | ♻️x          | **Self-fulfilling promise is outside our scope**            | **Point**: We exclude reinforcement loops where founder keeps increasing promise levels, expecting an increase of delivery from increase of funding. **Evidence**: Self-fulfilling prophecies where bold promises attract resources that enable delivery create endogeneity. **Explanation**: While promises may increase delivery capability through attracted resources, modeling this reinforcement loop would require dynamic analysis beyond our static optimization framework. **Transition**: Within these boundaries, we can derive optimal promise levels.                                                                                                                                         |
| [[🟧grow]]  | 🟧0          | **P\* = (2Cu + V) / 2(Cu + Co + V)**                        | **Point**: Optimal promise formula where underage cost drives boldness, building on D0 and D12. **Evidence**: When PF = P and PD = 1-P, the first-order condition yields closed-form solution. **Explanation**: The formula reveals that higher underage cost Cu and value V push toward bolder promises, while overage cost Co moderates them—capturing the essence of asymmetric costs (🟣⏰) and value creation (🟣⏰↕️) in one elegant expression. **Transition**: Speed factors modify this baseline formula.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|             | 🟧⏰          | **(2Cu + V) / 2μ(Cu + Co + V)**                             | **Point**: Speed factor μ from 🟣⏰↕️⏰ scales down optimal promise level. **Evidence**: Faster ventures with higher μ see reduced optimal P\*. **Explanation**: Counterintuitively, moving faster (higher μ) actually reduces optimal promise levels—the speed advantage allows more moderate promises while still capturing opportunities, suggesting speed and promise boldness are substitutes, not complements. **Transition**: The relationship becomes nonlinear under general conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|             | 🟧↕️         | **ln((2Cu + V) / (2Co + V))**                               | **Point**: Logarithmic transformation reveals nonlinear promise dynamics beyond speed effects. **Evidence**: Relaxing linear assumptions about PF and PD yields log-ratio formula. **Explanation**: The log structure emerges from balancing loops implicit in ♻️x—as promises become extreme, natural resistance emerges, creating diminishing returns that logarithmically bound optimal promises based on cost-value ratios. **Transition**: Speed and nonlinearity interact in complex ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|             | 🟧⏰↕️        | **(1/μ)ln((2Cu + V) / (2Co + V))**                          | **Point**: Combined speed-log formula where faster ventures need exponentially adjusted promises. **Evidence**: Synthesis of 🟧⏰'s speed effect and 🟧↕️'s nonlinearity captures 🟣⏰↕️⏰↕️'s insight. **Explanation**: Surprisingly, bolder promises (expanding state space) have the same effect as moving faster—both are mechanisms to overcome resource constraints, validating that spatial and temporal strategies are dual approaches to the same entrepreneurial challenge. **Transition**: These technical results enable practical wisdom.                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[🔴core]]  | 🔴0          | **Rational promise**                                        | **Point**: Entrepreneurs optimize promises given cost asymmetries—not irrationality but adaptation. **Evidence**: Our model rationalizes observed overpromising through Cu > Co conditions. **Explanation**: What appears as systematic bias is actually systematic adaptation to environments where dying unfunded is worse than failing funded, making bold promises the rational equilibrium response to entrepreneurial constraints. **Transition**: This rationality manifests differently across venture lifecycles.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|             | 🔴⏰          | **Agents adapt to decreasing Cu/Co environment**            | **Point**: As ventures mature, shifting cost ratios naturally moderate promise levels. **Evidence**: Early ventures (high Cu/Co) should promise boldly; later ventures (high Co/Cu) should moderate—each funding round shifts optimal promises. Fast clockspeed ventures maintain high Cu/Co longer. **Explanation**: Ecosystem designers encourage "fail forward" for early startups by lowering Co, which increases Cu/Co ratio and optimal promise levels, while mature firms with high Co and market saturation see lower Cu/Co ratios, naturally moderating promises. **Transition**: Ecosystems can actively shape these dynamics.                                                                    |
|             | 🔴↕️         | **Ecosystem designs Co, Cu, V**                             | **Point**: System architects can tune costs and rewards to shape promise behavior. **Evidence**: Increasing V decreases competence/carefulness; adjusting Cu moves toward overpromising; raising Co increases carefulness. **Explanation**: Ecosystem designers act as "promise choreographers," using three levers—underage cost Cu (through funding availability), overage cost Co (through failure penalties), and value V (through success rewards)—to orchestrate the optimal mix of bold and careful entrepreneurs. **Transition**: Individual and system rationality converge through mixing.                                                                                                        |
