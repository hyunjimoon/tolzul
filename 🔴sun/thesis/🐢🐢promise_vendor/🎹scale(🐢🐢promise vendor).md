| [[🟣alert]] | 🟣0          | **Phenomenon of entrepreneurs' overpromise and success**    | **Point**: Does entrepreneurs overpromise? What's the optimal level of promise when fundability and deliverability of the promise depends on its level? **Evidence**: Tesla Roadster promised 0-60 in <4 seconds, 236-mile range, zero emissions by 2008 despite complex global supply chain challenges. **Explanation**: These bold promises secured $45M series D in 2007 despite production uncertainties, suggesting overpromising serves a rational function in resource acquisition. **Transition**: This rationality emerges from a fundamental time asymmetry in entrepreneurial costs.                                                                                                         |
|             | 🟣⏰          | **Cu-now or Co-later? Promise then deliver discounts Co**   | **Point**: Future commitments create asymmetric costs: immediate unfunded death (Cu=$80M sunk R&D) vs delayed funded failure (Co=$100M reputation damage, lawsuits). **Evidence**: Time gap between promise and delivery creates discounting effect on Co, making immediate Cu more painful. **Explanation**: The promise-deliver sequence creates temporal tension where "fear of underage cost" (dying unfunded now) exceeds "fear of overage cost" (failing to deliver later), especially when future value V and discount rates δ can mitigate later costs. **Transition**: This temporal effect is amplified by creating new state variables.                                                    |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️        | **New variables P, F\|P, D\|P creates reward V**            | **Point**: Entrepreneurs expand value space by introducing promise level P and conditional probabilities F\|P (funding given promise) and D\|P (delivery given promise). **Evidence**: V=$300M revenue from 2.5k Roadsters × $100k, plus future Model S opportunity. PF(P)~80% given Musk's backing, PD(P)~20% initially due to supply chain complexity. **Explanation**: Value creation isn't just optimization within known parameters but expanding the state space itself, where promise P parameterizes both funding and delivery probabilities, creating new optimization landscape. **Transition**: Speed becomes crucial when navigating this expanded state space.                           |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️⏰       | **μ1: clockspeed ratio of founder to industry**             | **Point**: Fast-clockspeed ventures face amplified promise pressures through time compression. **Evidence**: Tesla moved ~3 times faster than traditional auto companies, compressing development cycles. **Explanation**: Time scale parameter μ1 affects cost discounting: C'o = Co·δ^(1/μ1), V' = V·δ^(1/μ1). Moving μ1 times faster amplifies the asymmetric cost gap—making immediate underage cost feel even larger relative to discounted future overage costs, naturally pushing toward bolder promises. **Transition**: Yet spatial expansion may complicate this temporal sprint.                                                                                                            |
|             | 🟣⏰↕️⏰↕️     | **μ2: scale coefficient expands market size**               | **Point**: Market expansion through scale parameter μ2 affects delivery probability. **Evidence**: Tesla targeted ~2x larger market (U.S.+Europe vs U.S. only), where V' = μ2V and PD(P) = e^(μ2V)/(1+e^(μ2V)). **Explanation**: Spatial expansion parameter μ2 captures how "sizing market twice larger doubles PD(P)." However, F⊥̸D, F\|P⊥D\|P violated—cash flow pressure prevented proper vertical integration, rushing outsourcing (Thailand→UK→California), showing how spatial expansion may drag the temporal sprint. **Transition**: These alert signals demand deeper analysis of the promise mechanism.                                                                           |
| [[♻️dig]]   | ♻️0          | **Entrepreneur's promise as core decision variable**        | **Point**: The promise level P becomes the central optimization variable—inverting newsvendor's inventory Q for demand D to promise P for delivery capability D. **Evidence**: Unlike traditional operations that optimize known variables, entrepreneurs optimize the promise itself as "pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled." **Explanation**: This inversion uniquely captures both temporal (resources now vs later) and spatial (opportunity expansion) dimensions, making promise P the central lever for bridging current constraints with future possibilities. **Transition**: This promise creates specific cost dynamics.                            |
|             | ♻️⏰          | **Temporal tension: pretty promise fuels funding but delays delivery** | **Point**: Bold promises create temporal tradeoff: min_P Co·PF(1-PD) + Cu·(1-PF)PD. **Evidence**: Higher promise increases funding probability PF(P)↑ but decreases delivery probability PD(P)↓, creating fundamental tension. **Explanation**: The temporal gap means future informs present—future promise affects today's funding. Increasing promise level increases overage cost Co·PF(1-PD) but decreases underage cost Cu·(1-PF)PD, with asymmetric costs tilting toward boldness when Cu > Co. **Transition**: This cost structure must incorporate value creation.                                                                                                                             |
|             | ♻️⏰↕️        | **Spatial tension with new reward V: min_P Co·PF(1-PD) + Cu·(1-PF)PD - V·PF·PD** | **Point**: Value V creates spatial complexity in the optimization: minimize cost minus value. **Evidence**: Expected profit E[π] = -Co·PF(P)·[1-PD(P)] - Cu·[1-PF(P)]·PD(P) + V·PF(P)·PD(P). **Explanation**: The promise P parameterizes value creation through joint probability of funding AND delivery. Higher promises may increase PF but decrease PD, creating rich nonlinear dynamics where optimal P* must balance three forces: overage cost, underage cost, and value creation. **Transition**: We exclude certain feedback dynamics from our scope.                                                                                                                               |
|             | ♻️x          | **Self-fulfilling promise is outside our scope**            | **Point**: We exclude reinforcement loops where funding enables delivery, creating endogeneity. **Evidence**: While F\|P /⊥ D\|P in reality (funding affects delivery capability), we assume F\|P ⊥ D\|P for tractability. **Explanation**: Self-fulfilling prophecies where bold promises attract resources that enable delivery would require dynamic analysis beyond our static framework. This simplification allows deriving closed-form solutions while acknowledging that "deep pocket effect" existed in Tesla's case. **Transition**: Within these boundaries, we can derive optimal promise formulas.                                                                                        |
| [[🟧grow]]  | 🟧0          | **News vendor baseline: P* = Cu/(Co+Cu)**                   | **Point**: Classical newsvendor with uniform [0,1] demand yields simple critical ratio. **Evidence**: Standard result where optimal inventory balances underage and overage costs. **Explanation**: This baseline formula shows that higher underage cost Cu drives higher optimal quantity, while overage cost Co moderates it. For entrepreneurs, this translates to promise level instead of inventory quantity, setting foundation for extended models. **Transition**: Adding value V changes the optimal formula.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|             | 🟧⏰          | **Promise vendor with reward: (2Cu + V)/2(Co + Cu + V)**    | **Point**: Adding value V to temporal model shifts optimal promise upward. **Evidence**: When PF = P and PD = 1-P (linear probabilities), first-order condition yields closed form. **Explanation**: The formula reveals dual effects: both higher underage cost Cu and value V push toward bolder promises, while overage cost Co moderates them. The factor of 2 emerges from probability derivatives, capturing how value creation amplifies the underage cost effect. **Transition**: Relaxing linearity assumptions yields different functional form.                                                                                                                                               |
|             | 🟧↕️         | **Nonlinear promise vendor: ln((2Cu + V)/(2Co + V))**       | **Point**: Logit probability models yield logarithmic optimal promise formula. **Evidence**: Using PD(P) = e^V/(1+e^V) captures diminishing returns in delivery probability. **Explanation**: The log structure emerges from S-shaped probability curves—as promises become extreme, natural resistance emerges. This creates bounded optimal promises based on cost-value ratios, preventing infinite promises even when Cu >> Co. The nonlinearity captures real-world saturation effects. **Transition**: Speed and scale parameters further modify this formula.                                                                                                                                      |
|             | 🟧⏰↕️        | **With speed and scale: (1/μ2)ln((2Cu + V·δ^(1/μ2))/(2Co·δ^(1/μ2) + V·δ^(1/μ2)))** | **Point**: Combined temporal (μ1) and spatial (μ2) effects create complex optimal promise. **Evidence**: Speed affects discounting δ^(1/μ1) while scale affects probability sensitivity μ2. **Explanation**: Surprisingly, both mechanisms work similarly—spatial expansion (μ2) and temporal acceleration (μ1) are dual strategies for overcoming constraints. The formula shows faster ventures (higher μ) need smaller promises due to time advantage, while larger scale opportunities also moderate promises through market size effects. **Transition**: These technical results enable practical insights.                                                                                 |
| [[🔴core]]  | 🔴0          | **Rational promise from founder's perspective**             | **Point**: Individual entrepreneurs rationally optimize P*\|(Co,Cu,V) given their cost-value structure. **Evidence**: Our model rationalizes observed overpromising when Cu > Co, common in early ventures. **Explanation**: What appears as systematic bias is actually systematic adaptation. Each founder faces unique (Co,Cu,V) parameters and rationally chooses promise level P* that minimizes expected cost minus value. Early-stage founders with high Cu/Co rationally overpromise. **Transition**: This individual rationality aggregates differently over time.                                                                                                                                      |
|             | 🔴⏰          | **Temporal: mix now and later within an agent**            | **Point**: Individual founders balance present and future through promise medium over time sequences P*_t\|(Co,Cu,V)^n_t. **Evidence**: Each funding round shifts parameters—success increases Co (more to lose), reduces Cu (proven model), affecting optimal P*_t+1. **Explanation**: Temporal mixing occurs within each entrepreneur's journey. Early bold promises (high Cu/Co) naturally moderate as ventures mature (lower Cu/Co). This isn't inconsistency but rational adaptation to changing parameters over time. Fast clockspeed ventures compress this evolution. **Transition**: Ecosystems shape these parameter trajectories.                                                           |
|             | 🔴↕️         | **Spatial: mix confidence and carefulness among agents**   | **Point**: Ecosystems optimize population mix through parameter design (Co,Cu,V)*\|P^{1..N}_{1..T}. **Evidence**: VC ecosystems encourage "fail fast" (low Co), accelerators provide resources (reduce Cu), prizes increase V. **Explanation**: System designers act as "promise choreographers," using three levers to shape agent behavior. Low Co encourages experimentation, high Cu drives urgency, large V attracts ambition. The ecosystem cultivates optimal diversity—some careful (high Co/Cu), some bold (high Cu/Co). **Transition**: Both mixing mechanisms create system-level rationality.                                                                                        |
|             | 🔴⏰↕️        | **Rational entrepreneurial ecosystem**                      | **Point**: System rationality emerges from dual mixing: temporal (within agents) and spatial (across agents). **Evidence**: (P,Co,Cu,V)*_T represents equilibrium where individual and system rationality align. **Explanation**: The ecosystem achieves dynamic balance through two mechanisms: (1) temporal—each entrepreneur evolves from bold to careful as parameters shift, (2) spatial—population maintains diversity through parameter heterogeneity. This dual mixing sustains innovation: bold entrepreneurs explore, careful ones exploit, with natural succession maintaining vitality. **Transition**: This framework explains entrepreneurial overpromising as feature, not bug. |
