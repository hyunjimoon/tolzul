For many entrepreneurs, time is a key constraint. They need to invest time to achieve growth, but also lose time because of recurring crises. We develop a simple stochastic dynamic program to model how an entrepreneur should prioritize between improving processes to reduce crises versus harvesting revenue or ensuring future growth. We show that it is initially optimal to prioritize process improvement: an entrepreneur should strive for high process quality early in the venture’s growth process. We numerically analyze a simple heuristic derived from this optimal policy and identify the conditions under which it is (or is not) effective. It performs near optimally except when process quality or revenue rate may deteriorate too fast or when the cost of process improvement or revenue enhancement is too high. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for the advice found in the popular entrepreneurship and time management literature to invest time now to save time later.

First, rather than determining how much time overall entrepreneurs should spend on their venture, we analyze how a given amount of time should be allocated among competing priorities. Second, we allow the entrepreneur to “create” future time by investing in process improvement.; Our work shares some of these elements, but we allow the entrepreneur to invest in process improvement. The key differences are that we focus on the investment of time, not money, and that we study process improvement in the context of entrepreneurship rather than production.) 을 잘 배합
