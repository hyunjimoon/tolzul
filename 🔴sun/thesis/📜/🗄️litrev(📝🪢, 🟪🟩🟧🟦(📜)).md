This is the conceptual root of `pull` systems.                               | Provides the philosophical foundation for `pull` strategies (build only what is needed, when it is needed), a core component of the push-pull framework that entrepreneurs must balance.                | **Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production**                                          |

It allows firms to benefit from economies of scale in the `push` stage while offering customization in the `pull` stage.                                  | Formalizes a key mechanism for implementing a push-pull strategy.
