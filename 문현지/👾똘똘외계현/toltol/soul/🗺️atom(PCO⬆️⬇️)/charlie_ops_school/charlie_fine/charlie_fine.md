Ideally, in my opinion, for each strand of relevant literature, you should briefly explain the thread of idea development, from the “classical” origin of the idea, to the relevant, current follow-on work.

if you were Odysseus A in below drama, how would you allocate the last three days to improve this draft to earn opportunity for oral exam? 

[1] A's heart lies in professionalizing in bayesian and evolutionary entrepreneurship. her faith is that this is the realm where she can best fulfill her parents' hope for her to become a great scholar, expressed through her name: 文(literature) 炫 (shine) 之 (go).

[2] This summer, A's humiliation grew from survival instinct to pass information to her phd advisor that precondition for thyroid cancer has been discovered from her mom in 2025 spring. A's mom, who is most grateful that A stumbled upon a wise advisor, hopes nothing but A to safely finish phd under his guidance.

[3] Double binded by her heart and humiliation, A spent life risking summer but upon receiving the feedback, A felt one suspicion gaining plausibility in her mind: funeral might be the happiest day of her life. The idea of cruel optimism, perceiving the implications of my optimism on becoming a scholar, was my redemption. Just so you know, suicidal and hatred towards academia are not a feeling in me, nor do i intend to have them in near future.

[4] Confused, A flips coin for the genre of her fate: comedy or tragedy. whatever the outcome, A feels she can never be a good daughter. perhaps right, but definitely not good.

But emotionally, I can only think of thanking you. I was struggling with homesickness and learning your excitement prevented burnout.

Dear Charlie,
"First fall in love with your advisor, then find your research question" is the best advice i chose to follow.
Thanks for being my intrinsic motivation, Charlie

hi charlie,
i'm reaching out to clarify and rationalize what i mean by "don't tell scott and moshe that i follow their advice to get investment".

clarify
i don't have any intention to hide this from them. as their (and your) time and effort investment is a "risk" to me when calculating risk-return ratio, i'm formulating an easy way to communicate this idea (which is being freshly developed based on BE reading group + chat with you + vikash's seminar).

the faster we acknowledge we're the prisoner of our perception, the more chance we can escape from the prison (although we never will).

rationalize
my ex-post rationalization is, when i faced with the binary choice of follow (accept) or not follow (reject) the advice, i calculate the uncertainty ratio. 

this is common in MCMC (metropolis hastings) algorithm to sample from posterior distribution (we use sampling as denominator marginal likelihood is intractable, but we can evaluate the ratio of posterior distribution's value of one sample) 

if the proposed posterior is higher we accept, if lower we reject with some probability - i call this ignorance prior meaning the more i don't know about it, i assign higher probability on going against my judgement.


of learn the weight of uncertainty in my mental model (uc1) and the uncertainty in advice-provider's mental model (uc2) to decide my next action (argmin_(a in A) (w1 * uc1 + w2 * uc2) analytical reason behind why i mostly follow your advice is i learned you iterate more before sharing your thought. everyone has their style.
