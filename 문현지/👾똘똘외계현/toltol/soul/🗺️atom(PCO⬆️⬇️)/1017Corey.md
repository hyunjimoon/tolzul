- opting out: some parameter that is not binding - we don't need market data
- haven't seen any model where we estimate all parameters
- patient flow: can only affect flow, system blackhole identification (chronic alzhimer), stroke (how acute stroke patient should be directed)
- people are smart and practical (get people's help in modeling)
