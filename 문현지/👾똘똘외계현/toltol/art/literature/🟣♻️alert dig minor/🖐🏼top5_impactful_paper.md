# sutton 
This paper re-examines the relationship between the R&D intensity of an industry and its level of concentration, from the perspective of the Bounds approach to market structure. In so doing, it proposes an index which summarises those aspects of technology and tastes that are relevant to the determination of a lower bound to concentration.
# 🐢paul on endogenous growth

This paper describes two strands of work that converged under the heading of 'endogenous growth.' One strand, which is primarily empirical, asks whether there is a general tendency for poor countries to catch up with rich countries. The other strand, which is primarily theoretical, asks what modifications are necessary to construct a theory of aggregate growth that takes the economics of discovery, innovation, and technological change seriously. The paper argues that the second strand of work will ultimately have a more significant impact on our understanding of growth and our approach to aggregate theory.

# 🐢eric on formal theory of strategy

What makes a decision strategic? When is strategy most important? This paper formally studies these questions, starting from a (functional) deﬁnition of strategy as the smallest set of choices to optimally guide (or force) other choices. The paper shows that this deﬁnition coincides with the equilibrium outcome of a “strategy formulation game,” in which such strategy endogenously creates a hierarchy among decisions. With respect to what makes a decision strategic and what makes strategy valuable, the paper considers the effect of commitment, reliability, and irreversibility of a decision; the presence of uncertainty (and the type of uncertainty); the number and strength of its interactions and the centrality of a decision; its level and importance; the development of capabilities; and competition.

# 🐢scott1 on technology s curve

A central premise of research in the strategic management of innovation is that start-ups are able to leverage emerging technological trajectories as a source of competitive advantage. But, if the potential for a technology is given by the fundamental character of a given technological trajectory, then why does entrepreneurial strategy matter? Or, put another way, if the evolution of technology is largely shaped by the strategic choices entrepreneurs make, then why do technological trajectories exhibit systematic patterns such as the technology S-curve? Taking a choice-based perspective, this paper illuminates the choices confronting a start-up choosing their technology by resolving the paradox of the technology S-curve through a reformulation of the foundations of the technology S-curve. Speciﬁcally, we reconceptualize the technology S-curve not as a technological given but as an envelope of potential outcomes reﬂecting differing strategic choices by the entrepreneur in exploration versus exploitation. Taking this lens, we are able to clarify the role of technological uncertainty on start-up strategy, the impact of constraints on technological evolution, and how technology choice is shaped by the possibility of imitation. Our ﬁndings suggest that staged exploration may stall innovation as a result of the replacement effect, increasing the strategic importance of commitment.

# 🐢scott2 on bayesian entrepreneurship

How does the fact that entrepreneurs choose the opportunity they pursue impact entrepreneurial strategy and performance? Entrepreneurs, while dealing with opportunities whose outcome is inherently uncertain, have choices that must be premised on a belief that the opportunity is worth pursuing. This insight provides an organizing principle for a Bayesian approach to entrepreneurial decision-making. A Bayesian approach offers a natural formal framework to assess how entrepreneurs form beliefs about the prospects for a given opportunity, how these beliefs evolve over time through active experimentation and learning, and the consequences of such beliefs for entrepreneurial strategy and performance.The goal is to shape distinctive implications and empirical approaches to the study of entrepreneurship guided by founding premises. The first premise is that the entrepreneur must be relatively optimistic about the opportunity relative to others. This involves a distinct theory that translates into a different perspective on the opportunity’s prospects. Second, this systematic divergence in beliefs impacts how an entrepreneur will undertake learning about an opportunity. Notably, the demand for “experiments” is fundamentally influenced by beliefs about the opportunity. For example, relative to a disinterested agent, a Bayesian entrepreneur will conduct experiments that are more likely to allow for “false positives” than “false negatives.” Finally, this approach promotes the processes by which entrepreneurs are able to attract resources and capabilities by providing information to other agents. Entrepreneurs are more likely to convince those who share their idiosyncratically optimistic beliefs about an opportunity (with implications for homophily and firm culture), yet will also engage in choosing experiments that cater to those with different (more negative) beliefs than they themselves hold.

# 🐢camuffo on theoretical driven decision making

This paper studies strategic decisions under uncertainty for which past data are not available. It provides microfoundations of the theory-based view of the firm by showing that the strategic problem starts with the selection of theories rather than choosing actions and that theories are selected through experiments. The value of experimenting with theories increases with the number of theories and with their uncertainty. Moreover, uncertainty makes theories superadditive—that is, experimenting with a more uncertain theory increases the benefits of experimenting with other more uncertain theories. The paper also shows that decision makers should experiment with more “surprising” theories because in this case experiments are more informative and enable more learning. A leading example helps to illustrate our concepts throughout the paper.

# 🐅nanda on financing entrepreneurial experiment

The fundamental uncertainty of new technologies at their earliest stages implies that it is virtually impossible to know the true potential of a venture without learning about its viability through a sequence of investments over time. We show how this process of experimentation can be particularly valuable in the context of entrepreneurship because most new ventures fail completely, and only a few become extremely successful. We also shed light on important costs to this process of experimentation and demonstrate how these can fundamentally alter both the rate and direction of start‑up innovation across industries, regions, and periods of time.

# 🐅nanda on killer experiment

We develop a model of learning through experimentation in a principal-agent framework. Investors only observe an experiment’s outcome, but entrepreneurs can impact the information contained in the outcome through the experiment’s design. Investors prefer ‘killer experiments’ that are more likely to correctly identify true successes and failures, but entrepreneurs prefer to design experiments that are less likely to fail. We show that the ensuing moral hazard can create a market failure in financing the venture, which cannot be resolved through higher-powered incentives for the entrepreneur such as standard ‘pay for performance’ contracts. Our results speak to an important potential friction in the commercialization of innovations, particularly ones in areas such as ‘Deep Tech’ ventures based on fundamental science, that lack well-understood methodologies for investors to effectively validate the information contained in early experiments.

# 🐙charlie on operations for entrepreneur

Although entrepreneurship-related papers have had some representation in Production and Operations Management (POM) over the past 30 years, the topic still seems a bit like a poor stepchild in the research of operations management (OM) scholars. Yet, entrepreneurship is important to the economy, and many schools are growing signiﬁcantly their entrepreneurship programs and offerings but often without reference to or inclusion of operations courses. This paper is motivated by the question of the operations needs of new ventures and how they might differ from the needs of large, established ﬁrms. Toward that end, we review brieﬂy the state of entrepreneurship scholarship in POM (and beyond), present our own (ﬁeld-based) research (and cases), and propose a framework for what we call “operations for entrepreneurs,” that we hope can be a basis for further productive research and curriculum development by the OM community.

# 👾andrew on parameterization and bayesian modeling

Progress in statistical computation often leads to advances in statistical modeling. For example, it is surprisingly common that an existing model is reparameterized, solely for computational purposes, but then this new configuration motivates a new family of models that is useful in applied statistics. One reason why this phenomenon may not have been noticed in statistics is that reparameterizations do not change the likelihood. In a Bayesian framework, however, a transformation of parameters typically suggests a new family of prior distributions. We discuss examples in censored and truncated data, mixture modeling, multivariate imputation, stochastic processes, and multilevel models.

# 👾andrew on bayesian workflow

The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.

# 👾josh on bayesian modeling of human concept learning

I consider the problem of learning concepts from small numbers of positive examples, a feat which humans perform routinely but which computers are rarely capable of. Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitative insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.

# 👾josh on one and done Optimal Decisions From Very Few Samples

In many learning or inference tasks human behavior approximates that of a Bayesian ideal observer, suggesting that, at some level, cognition can be described as Bayesian inference. However, a number of ﬁndings have highlighted an intriguing mismatch between human behavior and standard assumptions about optimality: People often appear to make decisions based on just one or a few samples from the appropriate posterior probability distribution, rather than using the full distribution. Although sampling-based approximations are a common way to implement Bayesian inference, the very limited numbers of samples often used by humans seem insufﬁcient to approximate the required probability distributions very accurately. Here, we consider this discrepancy in the broader framework of statistical decision theory, and ask: If people are making decisions based on samples—but as samples are costly—how many samples should people use to optimize their total expected or worst-case reward over a large number of decisions? We ﬁnd that under reasonable assumptions about the time costs of sampling, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions based on very few samples may be the globally optimal strategy over long periods. These results help to reconcile a large body of work showing sampling-based or probability matching behavior with the hypothesis that human cognition can be understood in Bayesian terms, and they suggest promising future directions for studies of resource-constrained cognition.


# 👾Meehl on Appraising and Amending Theories
In social science, everything is somewhat correlated with everything (“crud factor”), so whether H 0 is refuted depends solely on statistical power. In psychology, the directional counternull of interest, H*, is not equivalent to the substantive theory T, there being many plausible alternative explanations of a mere directional trend (weak use of significance tests). Testing against a predicted point value (the strong use of significant tests) can discorroborate T by refuting H*. If used thus to abandon T forthwith, it is too strong, not allowing for theoretical verisimilitude as distinguished from truth. Defense and amendment of an apparently falsified T are appropriate strategies only when T has accumulated a good track record (“money in the bank”) by making successful or near-miss predictions of low prior probability (Salmon’s “damn strange coincidences”). Two rough indexes are proposed for numerifying the track record, by considering jointly how intolerant (risky) and how close (accurate) are its predictions.

## implementable

it should have a tool to implement what the audience learn. 
- how to resolve "resistance to change"
- if supplying the research for the audience with economics background, i should camouflage the language to what they can (and don't have uncomfortableness in) digesting.
