| **📜🐅_kerr14**<br>*systematize(experimentation, entrepreneurship)* | Entrepreneurship = experimentation with unknowable probabilities | **Strongly agree**: Captures venture uncertainty | -                                    | Each funding round = experiment with capital at risk |
| **📜🐅_granovetter78**<br>*model(collective-behavior, thresholds)*  | Individual thresholds → collective outcomes                      | Threshold models useful for herding              | Too deterministic for markets        | Explains funding cascades and crashes                |
| **📜👾_bolton24**<br>*moral_hazard*                                 | Entrepreneurs design uninformative experiments                   | **Perfect fit**: Explains adverse selection      | -                                    | High τ = manipulating investor signals               |
| **📜🐅_loch02**<br>*optimize(portfolio, selection)*                 | Marginal analysis for portfolio optimization                     | Portfolio thinking essential                     | Misses active uncertainty management | VCs optimize across (n,τ) space                      |
| **📜🐅_kavadias03**<br>*sequence(projects, optimization)*           | cμ rule for project sequencing                                   | Sequencing matters                               | Too rigid, assumes fixed parameters  | Founders manipulate perceived urgency via φ          |
| **📜🐅_dada07**<br>*diversify(sourcing, suppliers)*                 | Diversification for risk management                              | Standard portfolio theory applies                | Sometimes concentration optimal      | High τ justified when C > diversification benefit    |
| **📜hume**<br>*enquiry_human_understanding*                         | No necessary causation, instinct over reason                     | Philosophical foundation for uncertainty         | -                                    | Justifies why markets price "unknown unknowns"       |

## Financial Mechanisms Mapped to Our Model

| Our Parameter | Financial Interpretation | Market Mechanism |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **φ (promise level)** | Implicit valuation claim | Term sheets, pitch decks |
| **τ (concentration)** | Information disclosure strategy | Due diligence resistance |
| **n (complexity)** | Systematic/market risk | Beta, volatility measures |
| **C (digestion cost)** | Due diligence expense | Legal, accounting, consultant fees |
| **Learning trap** | Liquidation preference overhang | Down rounds, washouts |

## Capital Market Dynamics

| Stage | Optimal τ | Optimal n | Investor Type | Key Trade-off |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Seed** | High | High | Angels | Protect idea vs attract capital |
| **Series A** | Medium | Medium | Early VCs | Signal quality vs maintain flexibility |
| **Growth** | Low | Low | Late VCs | Transparency vs competitive advantage |
| **IPO** | τ→0 | Low | Public markets | Full disclosure requirement |

## Risk-Return Implications

| Portfolio Strategy | (n,τ) Coordinates | Expected Return | Risk Profile |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Spray & Pray** | High n, Low τ | Low | Diversified |
| **Conviction Bets** | Low n, High τ | High | Concentrated |
| **Index Approach** | Medium n, τ→0 | Market | Systematic only |
| **Smart Money** | Variable n, Optimal τ* | Superior | Managed |

## Key Financial Insights
1. **Information Asymmetry**: τ directly measures degree of information withholding
2. **Staging**: Each round recalibrates both n and τ based on revealed information
3. **Valuation**: High τ commands premium from sophisticated investors, discount from others
4. **Exit Strategy**: IPO requires τ→0; M&A allows maintaining some τ
5. **Market Cycles**: Bull markets reduce C, encouraging τ→0; Bear markets increase C, justifying higher τ
