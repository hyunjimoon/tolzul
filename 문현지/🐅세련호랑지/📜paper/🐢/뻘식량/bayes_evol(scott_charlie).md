## Summary Statistics
- **Strong Agreement**: 4 papers (Yoo21, Yarkoni24, Alvarez_Porac20, Spearman22)
- **Strong Disagreement**: 1 paper (PhanChambers18)
- **Partial Agreement with Extensions**: 6 papers
- **Our Unique Contribution**: τ parameter (founder's chosen uncertainty) absent in ALL reviewed work

## Key Patterns
1. **Supporters**: Focus on endogenous learning, constructivist approaches
2. **Opponents**: Treat uncertainty as purely exogenous (nature-only)
3. **Gap We Fill**: No existing work captures founder's strategic uncertainty choice (τ)
