# Bayesian Evolution Literature Classification (Andrew & Josh Perspective)
## Based on 🗣️bayes_evol Framework - Bayesian Statistics & Innovation Policy Lens

### Core Framework Through Bayesian-Policy Bridge
- **Double Reparameterization**: P(success) → φ(promise) + n → φ(μ,τ) with founder's choice
- **Prior Predictive Checks**: Testing model assumptions before data collection
- **Simulation-Based Calibration**: Validating the entire inference pipeline
- **Policy as Uncertainty Management**: Government interventions as n-reducers, markets as τ-optimizers

## 🐅 Prairie Food (초원식량) Literature Classification

| Paper | Core Concept | 🟢 AGREE | 🔴 DISAGREE | 🔵 Our Extension |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **[[📜🐅_kerr14_systematize(experimentation, entrepreneurship)]]** | Entrepreneurship IS experimentation with unknowable probabilities | Experimentation = sequential updating of φ through PRHC | - | Our τ captures why some avoid informative experiments |
| **[[📜🐅_granovetter78_model(collective-behavior, thresholds)]]** | Individual thresholds aggregate to collective patterns | Threshold distribution = prior over population (mathematical beauty) | - | τ allows founders to manipulate threshold position |
| **[[📜👾_bolton24_moral_hazard]]** | Entrepreneurs design experiments to maximize positive results | **Strong Agreement**: Uninformative experiments = our high τ | - | Their P_E, P_I functions map directly to our uncertainty parameters |
| **[[📜🐅_loch02_optimize(portfolio, selection)]]** | Marginal analysis optimizes resource allocation | Stochastic dynamic programming parallels our sequential updating | Lacks founder's active uncertainty management | Ignoring correlations loses 20-35% value (supports hierarchy) |
| **[[📜🐅_kavadias03_sequence(projects, optimization)]]** | cμ rule assumes fixed delay costs and processing times | Sequencing important | Fixed parameters unrealistic; no promise manipulation | Promise level φ allows strategic urgency manipulation |
| **[[📜🐅_dada07_diversify(sourcing, suppliers)]]** | Diversification for risk reduction | Standard diversification theory | Sometimes concentration (high τ) optimal when C is high | Diversification assumes independence; we model correlation |
| **[[📜hume_an_enquiry_concerning_human_understanding]]** | No necessary connection between events; instinct over reason | **Deep Resonance**: Inductive reasoning unjustifiable (supports τ→0) | - | "Digestion cost" C captures instinctual thinking cost |

## Andrew-Josh Specific Contributions

### Bayesian Statistical Rigor (Andrew's Lens)

| Method | Application | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Prior Predictive Checks** | Validate φ distributions generate reasonable success rates | Check if promise distributions match industry patterns |
| **Posterior Predictive** | Ensure updated beliefs match observed pivot rates | Compare predicted vs actual founder adaptations |
| **Simulation-Based Calibration** | Recover true (n,τ) from observed promises | Generate synthetic founders, validate inference pipeline |
| **Hierarchical Modeling** | Industry → Founder → Venture structure | Partial pooling across levels for sparse data |
| **Model Comparison** | Test double reparameterization vs simpler models | WAIC, LOO-CV for model selection |

### Innovation Policy Applications (Josh's Lens)

| Stage | Policy Tool | Parameter Effect | Example |
|-------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Pre-promise** | Incubators | Calibrate initial φ | Y Combinator MVP advice |
| **Post-promise** | Accelerators | Optimize τ trajectory | Techstars mentorship |
| **Growth** | Grants/Patents | Reduce n uncertainty | SBIR validation, IP protection |
| **Scale** | Regulations | Force τ→0 transparency | SEC disclosure requirements |
| **Exit** | Public markets | Require full disclosure | IPO prospectus |

### Market Failures from Uncertainty Misalignment

| Failure Type | Cause | Our Model's Diagnosis | Policy Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Under-investment** | High n | Excessive nature uncertainty | Government R&D, infrastructure |
| **Adverse selection** | High τ | Information withholding | Certification, standards |
| **Inefficient allocation** | Misaligned (n,τ) | Wrong uncertainty for stage | Stage-appropriate funding |
| **Learning traps** | τ→∞ | Over-commitment to promise | Forced pivots, sunset clauses |

## Synthesis: Mathematical Elegance Meets Policy Relevance

### **Falsifiable Predictions**
1. Industries with higher n → lower average τ
2. Policy reducing n → increase in τ variance  
3. Lower C → bimodal τ distribution (all-or-nothing learning)
4. V/C×n ratio determines optimal τ*

### **Our Unique Bridge**
- **Statistical Rigor + Entrepreneurial Reality**: Prior predictive checks for promise distributions
- **Policy Mechanisms Through Uncertainty**: Governments manipulate n, markets optimize τ
- **Computational Tractability**: Double reparameterization enables MCMC implementation
- **Heterogeneous Effects**: Same policy affects different (n,τ) types differently

### **Philosophical Foundation (Hume)**
- No rational justification for induction → Supports τ→0 option
- Instinct over reason → Justifies digestion cost C
- Freedom within determinism → Promise determines trajectory but τ preserves agency
