The Most Relevant Question for Future Research

Based on the goal of synthesizing these frameworks, the most relevant question from the handout to include in your paper’s “Future Research” section is the one directed at Charlie Fine concerning the Precision of Probability Judgments.

Why this bridges your work:
1) It directly addresses your core theme: the strategic tension between ambiguity and precision, asking how precision in probability judgments evolves.
2) It uses the exact operational stages: framed with “Nail‑it” and “Scale‑it,” linking belief updates to Fine’s real‑world stages.
3) It probes the dynamics your model prescribes: your model specifies how precision (τ) should evolve; this question invites empirical testing of that prescription.
4) It provides a cognitive link: contrasting stable “core knowledge” with flexible “intuitive theories” (Ullman & Tenenbaum, 2020) aligns with the Nail‑to‑Scale transition and motivates integrating Tenenbaum’s learning framework.
