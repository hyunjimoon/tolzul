### Process Bottlenecks

The critical path method and the design structure matrix are designed for and applied primarily to the analysis of a single engineering project. Often, each project within a company is managed by its own project manager, not infrequently a heavyweight project manager, as suggested by the lean production paradigm, 211 who may have a great deal of autonomy in managing his or her project, using tools such as CPM and DSM. In such cases, however, there are often resources in the firm that must be shared across multiple projects. For example, in a semiconductor design house, the prototype manufacturing facility is often be shared across all the design projects. In an automotive company, the clay model shop, where models of the concept vehicles are made, is typically shared by the designers in various divisions, each of which is working on its own projects.

The process bottleneck perspective, explored in work by research teams at MIT and Stanford,212  reconceptualizes the product development function as analogous to a factory for product development. Instead of focusing on the activities and relationships within the CPM or DSM model for each project, the process bottleneck approach focuses on the resources to be used by all the projects. These resources collectively represent the firm‚Äôs product development factory. Applying the concepts from Goldratt‚Äôs ‚Äútheory of constraints,‚Äù which states that all factories have a bottleneck (or ‚Äúconstraint‚Äù) resource, 213 one then looks for the constraint resources in the company‚Äôs product development ‚Äúfactory.‚Äù

In the product development context, when multiple projects compete for bottleneck resources, each must wait in queue for its turn to access the constraint capacity. Managing these queues and the relative demand versus supply of capacity at them typically has an enormous impact on the development time of the individual projects. In one study at Polaroid, for example, individual projects under the direction of several project managers working separately were often completed many months, or even years, later than scheduled in the CPM models. 214 Our analysis, using the process bottleneck perspective, concluded that these models had ignored in their calculations the large chunks of time that projects waited for an opportunity to be serviced by the scarce bottleneck resources. Once top management realized that someone in the organization below the level of CEO needed to ‚Äúown the process‚Äù of assessing the capacity levels of various product development resources, the knowledge was available to reduce project completion times significantly.

... üëìA number of tools from multiple perspectives exist for two-dimensional concurrent engineering to support this process, including the various perspectives defined by DFM, project scheduling, design structure, process bottleneck, and customer requirements.


... As important as this insight and accompanying analysis is, its power can be increased by applying it to an integrated 3-DCE framework. In many development projects, supplier contributions can be the bottlenecks. These suppliers serve a large number of projects, sometimes more than one from the same customer. Adding key suppliers as resources in the model and, for those who may be bottlenecks, then managing them as carefully as internal bottlenecks are managed, can have a huge impact on total project time and performance.

In a research project at General Motors, we analyzed one of the key bottlenecks for the entire vehicle development process: the provision of stamping dies, large steel tools that provide the shape for all stamped metal body parts. 215

## **How Operational Excellence Pushes the Trade-off Frontier**

The operations management document provides crucial support for your argument through the **efficient frontier** concept. Here's the key insight:

### **Traditional View: Repositioning on the Frontier**

Most strategic thinking assumes entrepreneurs must **reposition** along an existing trade-off curve:

- **More prediction** ‚Üí Better stakeholder understanding but slower response
- **More prescription** ‚Üí Faster action but higher misalignment risk

This is like the document's example of airlines choosing between cost efficiency OR variety - accepting the trade-off as fixed.

### **Operational Excellence: Pushing Out the Frontier**

The document shows operations can **overcome trade-offs entirely** through enhanced capabilities. Key quote:

> "operations performance improvement is achieved by overcoming trade-offs, which, in turn, is achieved through enhanced operations capabilities"

**Example**: Operation B achieved better variety AND cost efficiency simultaneously through modular design, "pushing out the efficient frontier."

### **Applied to Your Framework**

Your push-pull integration represents **frontier-pushing operational excellence**:

- **Traditional approaches** accept the prediction-prescription trade-off
- **Your integrated approach** develops new capabilities that enable simultaneous learning AND betting
- This overcomes the dilemma rather than just repositioning within it

The document even mentions the **"tyranny of either/or"** vs **"and/also" approach** - perfectly capturing your integrated solution that achieves both robustness AND efficiency.

**Bottom line**: Operational excellence doesn't just optimize within constraints - it develops new capabilities that transcend traditional trade-offs entirely.
