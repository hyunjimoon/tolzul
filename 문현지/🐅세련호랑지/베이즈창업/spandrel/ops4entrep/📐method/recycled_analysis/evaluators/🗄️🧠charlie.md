# fiedelity of replication

Replication: For many business models, scaling requires replication and reproducibility. Once a process has been reﬁned, it may need to be replicated in many locations and settings, sometimes identically, and sometimes with modiﬁcations for localized needs for a different market segment. Organizations need to document and train and measure the capabilities and outcomes of replication efforts. Illustrative cases: Unity Homes, VFA.

Unity Homes was conceived to offer lower-priced homes but with a similar value proposition with regard to quality and energy efﬁciency. Unity homes were custom designed on a modular platform but offered less variety, less complexity, and smaller footprints than the typical Bensonwood home. Unity initially produced its panels in the Bensonwood factory, but that facility was not optimized for lower costs or lower variety required for the mid-tier market. In 2018, Unity opened a second factory in New Hampshire, designed for higher volume, lower variety, and lower cost, and had plans for replication of this factory design in different locations across the United States. The desire to maintain family control and expand through internally generated cash only slowed the growth as compared with what might be possible with a broader capitalization strategy.

VFA deployed a platformization strategy to create a business and management internship “fellows” program to match high-capability US millennials with startup companies that might not otherwise have ready access to such talent. Inspired in part by Teach for America, VFA aimed to recruit the best and brightest from the top universities, with a culturalization strategy to instill common innovation and entrepreneurship values throughout their network. VFA targeted small, entrepreneurial ventures in “second tier” entrepreneurial US cities (i.e., outside places like Silicon Valley, Boston, etc.) and deployed its elite troops into those ﬁrms, providing these startups with ﬁrst-class, albeit raw talent, and providing its recruits with a worm’s eye, hands-on experience in building a business. The ﬁrst cities selected, Detroit, New Orleans, and Providence, had existing entrepreneurial ecosystems in place but had a high need for exceptional talent. VFA then scaled their model with a replication strategy, copying the initial model for many other cities. The startups paid salaries to the fellows, but much of the organization’s overhead was covered by benefactors, whose donations represented charitable contributions for the sake of driving an industrial renaissance in some of America’s bygone business centers.
# organizational clockspeed
Further, all manufacturing leaders rotate positions, geographically and functionally, every two or three years. These steps have helped reduce organizational clockspeed to about six months and prevent the formation of “silos” or proprietary internal functions.

Thus, we can see that ASP has responded to increases in clockspeeds across its products, process, and organization structures. Building on these insights, I next present a systematic methodology for dynamic clockspeed analysis of the chains and illustrate it with examples from defense aerospace and information-entertainment.

One tack for assessing organizational clockspeed is suggested by a 1997 article in the New York Times, which observed that in the 1990s, increased stockholder activism and impatient corporate boards seem to have led to an decrease in the average tenure of CEOs in large, publicly-held companies.22 Closely related, a research study at Stanford University measured organizational clockspeed by looking at the frequency of organizational restructurings. 23 That study found that industry sectors where the product clockspeed was higher tend also to have faster organizational clockspeeds.

Next I look at universities, a traditionally slow-clockspeed sector, and observe that their main activities -- education and research as information commodities -- may see their organizational clockspeeds driven to dizzying rates.

**ARCHITECTURE:** Reverse parameter engineering where entrepreneurs choose their preferred stakeholder focus first, then engineer acceptance probabilities and costs to make that choice optimal.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Newsvendor model with discrete stakeholder commitments where demand represents commitment outcomes and the critical ratio determines optimal stakeholder prioritization.

**PRODUCT:** A decision framework that tells entrepreneurs how to engineer stakeholder acceptance probabilities (PR, PC) and commitment costs to validate their preferred customer-first or resource-partner-first strategy.

**PROCESS:** Reverse engineering methodology where entrepreneurs (1) choose their comfort-zone stakeholder focus, (2) map current acceptance probabilities, (3) engineer ecosystem parameters, (4) validate optimality using newsvendor critical ratio.

# list of bottleneck reference


you need to have a clear image of what your supply chain design looks like, who is doing what for whom, and where the “clockspeed bottlenecks” are occurring. The

### Process Bottlenecks

The critical path method and the design structure matrix are designed for and applied primarily to the analysis of a single engineering project. Often, each project within a company is managed by its own project manager, not infrequently a heavyweight project manager, as suggested by the lean production paradigm, 211 who may have a great deal of autonomy in managing his or her project, using tools such as CPM and DSM. In such cases, however, there are often resources in the firm that must be shared across multiple projects. For example, in a semiconductor design house, the prototype manufacturing facility is often be shared across all the design projects. In an automotive company, the clay model shop, where models of the concept vehicles are made, is typically shared by the designers in various divisions, each of which is working on its own projects.

The process bottleneck perspective, explored in work by research teams at MIT and Stanford,212  reconceptualizes the product development function as analogous to a factory for product development. Instead of focusing on the activities and relationships within the CPM or DSM model for each project, the process bottleneck approach focuses on the resources to be used by all the projects. These resources collectively represent the firm’s product development factory. Applying the concepts from Goldratt’s “theory of constraints,” which states that all factories have a bottleneck (or “constraint”) resource, 213 one then looks for the constraint resources in the company’s product development “factory.”

In the product development context, when multiple projects compete for bottleneck resources, each must wait in queue for its turn to access the constraint capacity. Managing these queues and the relative demand versus supply of capacity at them typically has an enormous impact on the development time of the individual projects. In one study at Polaroid, for example, individual projects under the direction of several project managers working separately were often completed many months, or even years, later than scheduled in the CPM models. 214 Our analysis, using the process bottleneck perspective, concluded that these models had ignored in their calculations the large chunks of time that projects waited for an opportunity to be serviced by the scarce bottleneck resources. Once top management realized that someone in the organization below the level of CEO needed to “own the process” of assessing the capacity levels of various product development resources, the knowledge was available to reduce project completion times significantly.

... 👓A number of tools from multiple perspectives exist for two-dimensional concurrent engineering to support this process, including the various perspectives defined by DFM, project scheduling, design structure, process bottleneck, and customer requirements.


... As important as this insight and accompanying analysis is, its power can be increased by applying it to an integrated 3-DCE framework. In many development projects, supplier contributions can be the bottlenecks. These suppliers serve a large number of projects, sometimes more than one from the same customer. Adding key suppliers as resources in the model and, for those who may be bottlenecks, then managing them as carefully as internal bottlenecks are managed, can have a huge impact on total project time and performance.

In a research project at General Motors, we analyzed one of the key bottlenecks for the entire vehicle development process: the provision of stamping dies, large steel tools that provide the shape for all stamped metal body parts. 215

## **How Operational Excellence Pushes the Trade-off Frontier**

The operations management document provides crucial support for your argument through the **efficient frontier** concept. Here's the key insight:

### **Traditional View: Repositioning on the Frontier**

Most strategic thinking assumes entrepreneurs must **reposition** along an existing trade-off curve:

- **More prediction** → Better stakeholder understanding but slower response
- **More prescription** → Faster action but higher misalignment risk

This is like the document's example of airlines choosing between cost efficiency OR variety - accepting the trade-off as fixed.

### **Operational Excellence: Pushing Out the Frontier**

The document shows operations can **overcome trade-offs entirely** through enhanced capabilities. Key quote:

> "operations performance improvement is achieved by overcoming trade-offs, which, in turn, is achieved through enhanced operations capabilities"

**Example**: Operation B achieved better variety AND cost efficiency simultaneously through modular design, "pushing out the efficient frontier."

### **Applied to Your Framework**

Your push-pull integration represents **frontier-pushing operational excellence**:

- **Traditional approaches** accept the prediction-prescription trade-off
- **Your integrated approach** develops new capabilities that enable simultaneous learning AND betting
- This overcomes the dilemma rather than just repositioning within it

The document even mentions the **"tyranny of either/or"** vs **"and/also" approach** - perfectly capturing your integrated solution that achieves both robustness AND efficiency.

**Bottom line**: Operational excellence doesn't just optimize within constraints - it develops new capabilities that transcend traditional trade-offs entirely.
