- problems that can solved from compass
how would solution template from different scale:
- society-ecosystem/democracy's [[def(sol4)]]
- sailing_firm-market's [[def(sol3)]]
- nailing-scaling_firm community's [[def(sol2)]]
- individual's [[def(sol1)]]

how could 
- pairs of need-sol are listed ($\infty:\infty \rightarrow M_n:N_n$)
- three are nailed and implemented as customer(need)-technology(sol) ($M_n:N_n \rightarrow M_s:N_s$)
- minimizing financial viability are explored (1:1)

pivot during nail stage is opting out, scaling is shifting (opting in) to better financially viable pair
