## DEGS
Discriminaton is equivalent to estimation or sorting on a grid system; inevitably, perceived worlds is a grid with a subjectively-defined `approximate-tolerance` or`precision` or `resolution`.

Architecturally, it would be the inverse of Generator: [[def(program)]], [[def(science)]] based on how in GAN discriminator neural networks are constructed inversely to generator.
