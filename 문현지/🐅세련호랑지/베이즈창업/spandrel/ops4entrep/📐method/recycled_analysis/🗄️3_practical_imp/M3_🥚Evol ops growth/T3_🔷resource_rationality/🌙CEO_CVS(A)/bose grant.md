Title: "Scaling AI for Entrepreneurial Decision-Making: A Probabilistic Programming Approach"

The complexity of decisions faced by entrepreneurs is of a significantly higher order of magnitude than other kinds of decisions we typically model. Entrepreneurship is not just crucial to economic growth; it is the beating heart of innovation and progress in our society. Yet, the stark reality is that 90% of startups fail, representing an enormous waste of human potential and resources. Our passion and vision lie in making a significant contribution to this hard problem by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies in novel ways.

We propose to develop a revolutionary approach to entrepreneurial decision-making using probabilistic programming. This methodology combines the power of machine learning, program synthesis, and program language design to create AI systems that can understand and reason about the world in ways similar to human cognition. By applying these advanced techniques to the complex, multifaceted challenges of entrepreneurship, we aim to dramatically reduce the failure rate of startups and unlock the full potential of entrepreneurial innovation.

Our vision extends beyond merely improving startup success rates. We see this research as a stepping stone towards addressing larger, more complex societal issues - what are often termed "wicked problems." By developing the capability to model and analyze the intricate dynamics of entrepreneurial decision-making, we are building a foundation for tackling even more challenging problems in the future, such as world hunger, climate change, or global economic inequality.

This research sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines, including computer science, cognitive science, economics, and entrepreneurship. It represents a bold new direction in AI research, moving away from the current focus on deep learning and towards more structured, interpretable, and human-like reasoning systems. Our approach promises not only to advance the field of AI but also to transform how we understand and support entrepreneurship.

By creating AI tools that can truly understand the nuanced, context-dependent nature of entrepreneurial decisions, we aim to democratize access to high-quality strategic advice. This could level the playing field between well-connected entrepreneurs with access to expert networks and those without such privileges, potentially reshaping the landscape of innovation and economic growth.

In essence, our passion is to use the most advanced AI techniques to solve one of the most complex and impactful human endeavors - entrepreneurship. Our vision is to create a new paradigm of AI-assisted decision-making that can eventually be applied to the world's most pressing problems.

Page 2: Unlikely to be Funded Through Traditional Means

Our proposed research, while immensely promising, faces significant challenges in securing funding through traditional channels due to its highly interdisciplinary nature and unconventional approach.

Firstly, our work sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines - artificial intelligence, entrepreneurship, cognitive science, and economics. Traditional funding bodies often struggle to evaluate proposals that don't fit neatly into established categories. Our research requires expertise from all these fields, making it difficult to find reviewers who can fully appreciate the scope and potential impact of our work.

Secondly, we are proposing to use probabilistic programming as the foundation for our AI system, rather than the more mainstream deep learning approaches. While we believe this approach offers significant advantages in terms of interpretability, data efficiency, and reasoning capabilities, it is not currently the dominant paradigm in AI research. Funding bodies tend to favor proposals that build on established methodologies, making our approach seem riskier in comparison.

Thirdly, our focus on entrepreneurial decision-making presents unique challenges in terms of data collection and validation. Unlike research on venture capital, where data is more readily available, studying the founder's perspective requires access to sensitive information and decision processes that are often not documented. This makes our research more challenging and potentially less attractive to traditional funders who prefer clearly defined datasets and easily measurable outcomes.

Furthermore, our proposal to develop a domain-specific language for entrepreneurship is a novel concept that doesn't fit neatly into either computer science or business research. This aspect of our work, while potentially transformative, may be seen as too speculative for traditional funding sources.

Lastly, the long-term nature of our vision - to develop AI systems capable of addressing complex societal problems - may not align well with the shorter-term, more concrete outcomes often preferred by traditional funding sources. While we believe our work on entrepreneurial decision-making will yield significant short-term benefits, the full potential of our research may only be realized over a longer timeframe.

In summary, while our research has the potential for enormous impact, its interdisciplinary nature, unconventional methodologies, data challenges, and long-term vision make it unlikely to receive funding through traditional means. The Amar G. Bose Research Grant Program, with its emphasis on bold, boundary-defying research, represents an ideal funding source for our innovative and potentially transformative work.

Page 3: Boldness in Choosing New Directions

Our research proposal represents a bold new direction in both AI research and entrepreneurship studies. We are not merely applying existing AI techniques to a new domain; rather, we are proposing a fundamental shift in how we approach AI for complex, real-world decision-making.

1. Probabilistic Programming for AI: While much of the AI world is focused on deep learning, we are boldly pursuing probabilistic programming as our core methodology. This approach allows us to create AI systems that can reason about uncertainty, incorporate prior knowledge, and provide interpretable results - crucial features for entrepreneurial decision-making that are often lacking in traditional deep learning systems.

2. Synthesis of Multiple Disciplines: We are ambitiously combining machine learning, program synthesis, and program language design in a novel way. This interdisciplinary approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each field: the pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning, the structured reasoning of program synthesis, and the expressive power of domain-specific languages.

3. Domain-Specific Language for Entrepreneurship: We propose to develop a new programming language specifically designed for modeling entrepreneurial decisions. This is a bold step that goes beyond simply applying existing AI tools to entrepreneurship. By creating a language that can express the unique complexities and uncertainties of entrepreneurial decision-making, we are opening up entirely new possibilities for modeling and analyzing these processes.

4. Human-Like Reasoning in AI: Our approach aims to create AI systems that can reason about the world in ways similar to human cognition. This is a significant departure from current AI systems that often operate as "black boxes." We believe this approach will lead to AI assistants that can provide more nuanced, context-aware advice to entrepreneurs.

5. Bridging Theory and Practice: We are boldly attempting to bridge the gap between theoretical models of entrepreneurship and the messy realities of startup life. By incorporating real-world complexities into our models, we aim to create tools that are not just academically interesting, but practically useful for entrepreneurs.

6. Scaling from Entrepreneurship to Wicked Problems: While our initial focus is on entrepreneurial decision-making, our ultimate vision is to develop AI systems capable of addressing much larger, more complex societal issues. This ambitious scaling of our approach from business problems to global challenges represents a bold new direction in AI research.

7. Challenging the Status Quo: Our research challenges several status quos simultaneously. In AI, we're moving away from the dominant deep learning paradigm. In entrepreneurship research, we're shifting focus from VCs to founders. In programming language design, we're creating languages for modeling human decisions rather than computer processes.

By pursuing these bold new directions, we aim to create a paradigm shift in how we approach complex decision-making problems. Our research has the potential to not only transform entrepreneurship but also to open up new possibilities for AI in addressing some of society's most pressing challenges.
