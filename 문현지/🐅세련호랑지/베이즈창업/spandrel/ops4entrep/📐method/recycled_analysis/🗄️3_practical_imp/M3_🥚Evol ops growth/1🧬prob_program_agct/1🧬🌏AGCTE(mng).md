 - reverse engineering dynamic decision with `fx_pcsth` (f: summary stat. x: observed time series, p: parameter (both estimated, fixed), c: component/sector, s: space, t: time, h: hyper-parameter/actionable) whose construction is detailed in [this](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/VaccineMisinf/blob/cafe219dac0bdfdd6043df25b95910d55b6376a7/V81/tf_fx_pcsth.py#L74)python file

- hmc vs smc
- three [[sampling]] methods
- idea without physical constraints (domain knowledge), deterministic and causal tree where there exists unique path between any two nodes - like  QMR which represent disease and symptoms with bipartite graph which lowered complexity from 2^4600 to 600 + 2^k
