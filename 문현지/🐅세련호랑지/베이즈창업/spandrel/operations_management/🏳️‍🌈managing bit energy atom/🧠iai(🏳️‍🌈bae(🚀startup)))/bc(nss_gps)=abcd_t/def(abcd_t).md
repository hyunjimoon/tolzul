- H1.1 (separation) harder product has stricter separation between development and production phase due to high failure cost from nested structure of manufacturing and catastrophe visibility
- H1.2  (co-adaptation) harder product has slower co-adaptation speed between demand and supply (need and solution)
- H1.3.1 (viscous pivot) softer product has lower risk but lower threshold leading to less viscous pivot strategy
- H1.3.2 (org, tech complexity, transfer learning): easier for harder or softer?
- H1.4 (organization structure) harder product has more centralized organizational structure which is integrated hence less generalizable and harder to copy
- H2. industry's bottleneck flips from software to hardware due to slower evolution speed of hardware in 1
- H3.1 (uncertainty management) operationalize H1, H2: soften than harden, contract4cowcamouflage, controlling local clockspeed (prioritize ibm pc)
- H3.2 optimize dynamic attention ratio for three information sync
- H4 üêÅ demonstrating why = example of how: why need innovation (graceful disintegration) = example of entrepreneurship strategy
