1. theory1: [[startup operation is NP]], approximate algorithms (column generation, benders (row generation), lp relaxation)
2. theory2: software needs column generation (opt out; outward approximation), hardware needs row generation (in)
3. tool: knapsack reformulation - change representation and add "cut" 
	1. systemic cuts (auto(vcut))
	2. ideal form
	3. when is good enough?
4. 
- difference of physical and social science (why one at a time is more challenging in social science)
