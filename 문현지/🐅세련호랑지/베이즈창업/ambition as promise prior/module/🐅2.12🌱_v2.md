## B.1: The Anatomy of Success Probability (Bayesian-Evolutionary Version)
### Modeling Founder's Adaptive Behavior with Bayesian Approach

# Part 1: Separating Founder from Venture - The RRHC Framework

## Three Core Contributions

### 1. Separation: Founder from Venture
Describing the effect of knowledge and intention in business modeling through:
- **Knowledge**: Modeled as prior and likelihood (Bayesian statistics)
- **Intention**: Test statistics for model checking (Prior Predictive Check)

### 2. Endogenization: Success Probability
Prescribing regularization of nature with three abstractions:
- **Complexity (n)**: From reliability engineering
- **Randomness**: Information-theoretic entropy
- **Concentration (τ)**: Founder's controlled uncertainty

### 3. Bridging: Action and Planning Schools
Through rationalizing ignorance and connecting:
- Bayesian Entrepreneurship (Stern, 2024)
- Evolutionary Entrepreneurship (Fine, 2025)

## The RRHC Framework

### R1: First Reparameterization
**P(success) → φ(promise level)**
- Computational convenience for model testing
- Promise gains substantial meaning (Gelman's latent parameter)
- Similar to evolutionary exaptation

### R2: Regularization with Nature
**φ* = 1/(n+1)**
- n = operational complexity from reliability engineering
- Higher complexity → More conservative promises
- Model M1 → M1' transition

### R3: Second Reparameterization  
**φ → μ(aspiration) × τ(concentration)**
- Separating internal ambition from external communication
- Two sources of uncertainty:
  - Nature's complexity (n) - exogenous
  - Founder's concentration (τ) - endogenous

### H: Hierarchization
**φ ~ Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ)**
- Probabilistic framework for learning
- Enables posterior updates
- Model M2 → M2' transition

### C: Calibration (our addition)
**τ* = max(0, V/ic - 1)**
- V = venture value
- i = information integration cost (rational meaning construction)
- c = system complexity

## The Epistemological Evolution

Founder's perception of success probability evolves:

1. **Constant**: Market determines (traditional view)
2. **Variable**: I can influence (M1)
3. **Random Variable**: Distributional thinking (M2)
4. **Sample**: Approximating true quality (M2')

## Rational Meaning Construction Cost

Cost of integrating new information with existing model:
- Testing cost
- Comparison cost  
- Simulation cost
- Organizational consistency cost

Like hiring: Both culture and employee must update (huge cost).

## Key Propositions

### Proposition 1 (Nature's Constraint)
φ* = 1/(n+1) - optimal promise under complexity

### Proposition 2A (Learning Trap)
τ → ∞ leads to rigidity, inability to pivot

### Proposition 2B (Rational Ignorance)
τ = 0 when V/ic < 1 - ignorance becomes optimal

## Connection to Literature

### Planning School
- High τ preference
- Porter, Henderson, Camuffo

### Action School  
- Low τ preference
- Sarasvathy (Effectuation), March (Exploration)

### Our Bridge: Evolutionary-Bayesian
- τ as strategic variable
- Connects Andrew Lo's adaptive markets
- Extends Bayesian Entrepreneurship (Stern)
- Links to Charlie's clock speed model
