Amazon example is particularly relevant - Bezos didn't just build an e-commerce site (the customer problem), he solved the deeper structural challenge of fulfillment infrastructure (the startup's problem-of-value). This required exactly the kind of operational complexity you're talking about: warehouses, logistics systems, supply chain orchestration, inventory optimization.


**BRIDGING: Action and Planning Are Not Opposites But Regions**

The eternal debate between action and planning schools dissolves when viewed through our parameter space. They don't represent competing paradigms but optimal strategies in different regions of the same reality:

| | Low Complexity (n→0) | High Complexity (n→∞) |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Learning Cost (C→0)** | Pure Learning<br>Effectuation dominates<br>τ → 0 optimal | Cautious Exploration<br>Staged commitment<br>τ increases over time |
| **High Learning Cost (C→∞)** | Focused Execution<br>Narrow experiments<br>τ moderately high | Rational Ignorance<br>Commit and persist<br>τ → ∞ or τ → 0 |

March's exploration-exploitation trade-off? It depends on n and C.  
Sarasvathy's effectuation versus causation? Different regions of τ space.  
Christensen's disruption? A trajectory through this parameter landscape.
