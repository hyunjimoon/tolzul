**Learning** involves:

- Updating mental models (M1→M1'→M2→M2')
- Processing information (integration cost i)
- Revising beliefs about success probability
- Cognitive/epistemic changes

**Adapting** involves:

- Structural/behavioral changes
- Pivoting strategies
- Modifying team size or complexity
- Observable organizational changes

In our Tesla vs Better Place analysis:

**Founder's role (Learning)**:

- Elon Musk learned from each experiment
- Updated his understanding of market needs
- Revised τ based on new information
- Evolved mental models about EV adoption

**Venture's role (Adapting)**:

- Tesla pivoted 15+ times
- Changed from Roadster to Model S to Model 3
- Adjusted organizational structure (270→50,000 employees)
- Modified charging infrastructure strategy

The venture is the manifestation of the founder's learning. It adapts structurally based on what the founder has learned cognitively. The venture doesn't have independent consciousness to "learn" - it changes through the founder's updated decisions.ada
