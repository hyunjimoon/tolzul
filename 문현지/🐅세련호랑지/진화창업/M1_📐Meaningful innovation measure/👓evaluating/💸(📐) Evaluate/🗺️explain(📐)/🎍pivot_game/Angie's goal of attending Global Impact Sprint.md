My phd thesis is on <font color  = "#C0A0C0"> Bayesian Entrepreneurship (BE) </font> and <font color  = "green">Probabilistic computing (PC) </font>. I'm very passionate about making a curriculum supported by a simulation tool (first prototype: [pivot game](https://amoon.world/%F0%9F%8C%99amoon()/%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8Feducate(ops-innov)/%F0%9F%8E%8Dpivot_game/pivot+game+for+startup+educators)) that equips bayesian entrepreneurial mindset to students. 

The two schools of thought I'm trying to synthesize, <font color  = "#C0A0C0"> BE </font>and <font color  = "green"> PC </font>,  were both born in MIT. In 2024, more than 40 scholars and practitioners around the world gathered to officially launch a concept in the form of a conference (Bayesian Entrepreneurship Conference for `BE` and CHICon for `PC`). Main organizers of each conference, Scott Stern and Vikash Mansinghka, who are my committee members gave access to each community to support my research. Architectures that has been developed for the last five years, is well introduced in Agrawal et.al. (2024) and Wong et.al. (2023). 

Table below is constructed by matching desirability and feasibility of two communities that is preparing to scale. Each launched their first conference in 

play the role of architecture for each community. Using this,  which has four submodules (Priors, Experimentation & Learning, Persuasion, Pedagogy & Practice)  describes Probabilistic Reasoning, Relational Reasoning, Perceptual and Physical Reasoning, Social Reasoning

 in entrepreneurship  and computer human interface fields. 
 
1. feasibility: summarize PPL's architecture from PPL_architecture.pdf. subchapters are Probabilistic Reasoning, Relational Reasoning, Perceptual and Physical Reasoning, Social Reasoning

desirability: summarize BE's architecture from BE_architecture.pdf. subchapters are Priors, Experimentation & Learning, Persuasion, Pedagogy & Practice.

which has rows from  includes education modules that BE X PC can cover. My hope is this framework can contribute to designing future global impact sprint workshops!
