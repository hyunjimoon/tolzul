 - introduced asymmetric effect of time on two costs (future overage cost discounting) 
 - S-curve diffusion consists of the first exponential growth from reinforcing and the second from balancing loop
 - promise-fund-deliver.
	 - fund given promise has reinforcing effect i.e. the more your promise the more fund you get and the more you get funding the more you can promise
	 - deliver given promise is balancing loop i.e. the more you promise, the more you may deliver to certain degree, but this reinforcement faces physical bound
	
	- P(D|Q) = \integ P(D|F,Q) P(F|Q) dF
		- P(D|F,Q) is deliver probability given promise level (Q) and capital level (F)
		- P(F|Q) is funding probability given promise level 
 - not including reinforcement loop and balancing


definition of the prior predictive distribution, which is obtained by marginalizing the joint distribution `p(D,θ|M)` over the parameters θ

prior predictive distribution of deliverability D given promise level Q is 

demand D given inventory level Q  min_Q Co(D-Q)^+ + Cu(Q-D)^+

no, promise is promise to oneself, choosing optimal level of promise with one's desired speed and size
