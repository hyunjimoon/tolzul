It was more a sociology study, and then we'll sort of get back to SBIR, but where it was more like social psych, but where they were like doing questions like, What is the population of Mozambique? They did to entrepreneurs. And then similar MBAs weren't entrepreneurs. And basically, the entrepreneurs were no better at picking population of Mozambique than the others. They then they said, What are your air bands around that estimate? And the entrepreneurs were all like, our air ban is between 14 point 2,000,014 point 8 million, as opposed to between 20 million and 80 million, right? They were just incredibly overconfident in terms of, yeah, but I don't think I have not seen anything that tries to relate the overconfidence to success.
