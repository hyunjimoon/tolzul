## Introduction
## ﻿﻿Background and Motivation
- ﻿﻿Contribution
## ﻿﻿The Willingness to Pay for the Automated Vehicle

- car subscription (!= leasing)
- stated-preference survey (among car-oriented population)
- The willingness to pay for the automated vehicle subscription: Insights from a car-oriented population in China https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856424002362
- pro-AV attitude - av subscription 
## ﻿﻿Impacts of On-Demand Urban Air Mobility

⭐️demand uncertainties and supply variations
- microsimulation platform, SimMobility (fully disaggregated analysis); INNOVATIVE (boston, toronto, chicago), SPRAWL (baltimore, indianapolis, Austin; car-oriented)

- car population we're influencing with UAM

Potential short- to long-term impacts of on-demand urban air mobility on transportation demand in North America https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856424003367

UAM potential market for high income individual

## Modeling for Teleactivity: A Needs-based Approach
- total demand with rise of teleactivity
- underlying activity generation mechanism not captured
- generation of activity ; theoretical model development and numerical test
- psychological inventory
- potential in behaviorally-sound needs-based population generation
## Social Welfare Impacts of Pricing and Revenue Recycling

- social impact of social welfare
- tradeoff btw efficiency vs. equity (always ppl who are negatively impacted) - e.g. nyc congestion pricing
- revenue recycling: congestion planing to renovate signal system
- mitigate adverse impact of pricing
- targeted revenue recycling
- distributional impact of population (who to target - how do you know the right aggregation level?)
- long term: month-to-month, year-to-year; midterm: day-to-day 
- HOW IS TIME AGGREGATION DIFFER FROM SPACE AGGREGATION??
- surplus-based allocation algorithm: (goal: targeted transit improvement) 
GRADUAL (animation) targeted with efficiency check is helpful (alg. with target with eff)

revenue recycling for targeted transit improvement increases efficiency and effectively mitigate adverse impacts of pricing
## Conclusion
-  user Center application of technological advancements of transportation, and we are investigating different kind of possible alternatives
- AV, UAM, pricing and revenue recycling


Q1. is data really confidential
Q2. targeted (existing transit network); only means of revenue recycle (personalized tolling, tradable mobility credit (mitigate inequity effect))
Q3. alternative way to spend congestion pricing (https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/ravi-seshadri was one of committee member)
