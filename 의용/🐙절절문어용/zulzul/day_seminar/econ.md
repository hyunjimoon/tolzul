check plus 

delineation of assumptions are made when we make particular theortical conclusions
e.g. marshallian demand functions

five modules (demand + consumer choice, choice under uncertainty (4), producer theory (4), equilibrium theory (7), social choices(1))

- subsidy for install solar panels in armonia 
	- 1.equilibrium, 2.allocations of resources, 3.policy efficiency,  4.externalities
	- model gives testable implications which can be validated or proven wrong with data
	- estimate treatment effect; $y =  \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$ (local avg. treatment)
	- [frank wolak](https://economics.stanford.edu/people/frank-wolak): structural econometric modeling: rationales and examples from industrial organization; micro founded (consumer and producers like or not like, )
	- issues of econ. casuality doesn't get resolved from putting y and x on right and left
- str.model is usage of econ.theory to inform restrictions we place on data

- why theory? respond to the imposition of a tax in the same way they respond to price increase (forecast the outcome of inference)

## preference relations
- foundation of choices are preferences
- >= binary relations (btw objects)
- x=R+^2 (usually positive: short stock)
- indifferent := A>=B, B>=A
- strictly prefer := A>=B, not B>=A
- sets in pref. space: I_y = {x \in X: x~y}: set of bundles that I like just as much as y
- U_y = {x \in X: x>y}, L_y = {x \in X: y>x}
- lower level set is like less or indifferent; where as indiff set is curve
- 2.2kg of applies, indiff set:2.2-2.9, upper level set: x>=2
- complete if x>=y or y>=x 

- complete: in amazon, we can't assume preference as there are millions of products
- transitive: x>=y, y>=z -> x>=z
- rational: complete and transitive
- choice rule: mapping $C: {B} \rightarrow S$ where S is non-empty subset of B (S may not be singleton due to indifference)
- weak axiom of revealed preferences (WARP): x, y \in B, x \in C(B), then for any B' where x, y \in B' and y \in C(B'), (independence of irrevalnt preference: iia); weak cuz general
- C*(B) =  x in B, x>=y, 
- rationality is fundamental as without it we can't get WARP. WARP, 

C*(B) preference is not rational
- preference stable to be rational?; can have choice set warp but not rational (not rational but always point to apple)
- irrational

QQ. gives nothing (if x is not in B')
monotonic but not strongly monotonic: leontieff min(x,y) - need both of them to bigger

more is better but not; I only neeed a littlbe bit of one thing to prefer that bundle; need to have everything more
monotonic but not strongly montonic in eng: monotonic for every dimension (e.g. washing machine - 3개 이상은 불필)
- LNS:= local non-satiated (close neighborhood):=preference are sufficiently rich (incrementally improve); 정수사과 예제는 2.3근처 동그라미 그릴수 있으므로 lns
QQ. is leontieff LNS?

convexity of pref: upper level set is convex (pref is cvx if upper set is ; intermediate ); not exterme 
convex ; strictly convex 
- utility functions {x|u(y) =u(y)}; monotone and convex (between curve is still in the upper level set), strictly monotone (holding fixed - strongly - unless we have vertical/horizontal line)
- utility functions: dense (cvx, LNS)
- next class: how to systematically relate preferences to numeric function
- binary vs utility ~ partial vs general equilibrium (everything affects everything else )
- lns -> mon. -> str mon. (leontiff is lns)
