## Table 1. 🤜*“Implement”* in Scott vs. Charlie

| **Aspect**           | **Scott’s Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Charlie’s Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Core Meaning**     | *Turning strategic choices into action* so the startup can capture and sustain value. Involves deciding on a path (IP, disruption, etc.) and then **implementing** it.                                                                                             | *Realizing operational and supply-chain designs* (3-DCE, clockspeed) in practice. Emphasizes cross-functional coordination in design, engineering, and production.                                         |
| **Primary Emphasis** | *Entrepreneurial strategy to create & capture value:* once the venture picks a strategy (e.g. disruption, value chain, IP), it must **implement** the specific commitments, organizational processes, and resource allocations needed to deliver on that strategy. | *Engineering & operational integration:* once a firm defines product/process architecture, it must **implement** concurrency, supply-chain design, and capability development to ensure speed and quality. |
| **Key Challenges**   | - Managing disclosure (for IP strategy) <br/> - Organizing resources to transform an idea into a market offering <br/> - Aligning the organization to sustain advantage after strategy is chosen                                                                   | - Overcoming organizational silos when combining product, process, and supply-chain development <br/> - “Not blowing up” the organization when introducing new concurrency tools                           |
| **Typical Examples** | - **Better Place**: difficulties **implementing** an IP/business-model approach with automakers <br/> - **Architectural strategy**: must be actively **implemented** with high upfront investments (platform design, tipping the market)                           | - **Toyota**: tries to **implement** global 3-DCE from a highly integral supply base <br/> - **HP**: must **implement** bundling/unbundling processes carefully to manage liability and concurrency        |
In **Scott’s** context, “implement” is largely about putting a *chosen entrepreneurial strategy* into practice—aligning resources, making key organizational commitments, and setting the firm up to *create and capture value* given the strategic path (e.g., IP, disruption, or value chain). In contrast, **Charlie** uses “implement” to mean operationalizing complex *engineering and supply-chain designs*, especially under concurrent engineering (3-DCE) and clockspeed principles. While Scott emphasizes the transition from *idea or strategy selection* to fully deploying it in the market, Charlie focuses on the *multi-layered technical and process* challenges of introducing concurrency and robust supply-chain architecture.

## 🤜executed (~10)
- they knew that they had to continue to 🤜execute well to maintain their market position over time.
- For a 🐅disruption strategy startup, the ultimate test of your hypotheses is (a) whether you can find customers that are unhappy with the current offerings available from existing firms, and (b) whether you have an idea that can be 🤜executed quickly and if you can find evidence for market inertia, organizational inertia, or numerous potentially disruptive technologies facing incumbents.
- Alongside testing that they can create novel value for a customer group traditionally ignored by incumbents, the second step is to determine if the startup is able to 🤜executed quickly while evading incumbent detection and reaction.
- Warby Parker has 🤜executed quickly and consistently, scaling to more than $100 million in annual revenues and over 500 employees in less than five years.
- existing value chain itself defines a functional role for the venture as a partner which will be successful if the entrepreneur can build an organization that focusses on a core competency allowing it to 🤜execute on building functional capabilities
- Disruption strategy 🤜executes on key INTEGRATED capabilities (🤜executed quickly and be fast to market to avoid rapid incumbent response) whereas Value chain strategy: 🤜executed on key FUNCTIONAL capabilities (🤜executed quickly to bring the best solution for a segment through an existing value chain)
- Execution: There is an alternative to seeking control and that is to focus on execution. This involves choosing not to try and build barriers against future competition but instead choosing to face that competition head-to-head when it arises and being prepared for it. In the 1990s, when Mark Benioff saw the web browser, he wondered why it was typically being positioned as a means for consumers or end-users accessing the Internet. If consumers could use the web to interact with Amazon, why couldn’t salespeople use it to interact with their own customers? Prior to the establishment of his company, Salesforce.com, salespeople, if they used information technology at all, would be constrained to enterprise software solutions for customer relationship management (or CRM) that were housed on internal networks and walled off from the outside world. What is more, these systems were static and would not evolve with user needs. In founding Salesforce, Benioff sought to bring sales into the digital age with a suite of services designed to empower salespeople in their jobs. As part of this, he introduced the notion of ‘software as a service.’ The applications would evolve and change as the needs to salespeople themselves changed. Benioff’s applications would be housed on what we now call cloud computing. They would update automatically. They would be born on the Internet. There was an important strategic element to this plan. Cloud computing was hardly uniquely available to Salesforce. What was to stop competitors from providing their own services should Salesforce prove successful? The answer, really, was nothing and Benioff knew it. That meant that there was no possibility of really building a ‘moat’ around this business. To be sure, he could have made it difficult for users to switch but to do so would require making it hard for them to start using his applications in the first place. But that involved its own costs. Benioff’s vision was to produce a service that was customer-focused and responsive. But if there was limited take-up, that feedback would not be provided and hence, his product development strategy would be at risk. Thus, it made more sense to focus on execution as a path that was consistent with the type of position Salesforce wanted to establish in the market even if that left them vulnerable to future competition. When entrepreneurs say that they are “focusing on execution,” one could be forgiven in thinking that should be an obvious thing for all businesses to do. After all, doesn’t “execution” mean “doing things well and efficiently”? However, all decisions face trade-offs. As entrepreneurs have limited resources and time, when they focus on one thing, they must choose not to do something else. When Benioff decided to focus on ensuring his customers could gain immediate value from his CRM services, that meant that he had to invest in capabilities—software developers, cloud infrastructure and the like—to start developing customer-facing features. It also meant that he could not afford to invest in ways that might cause customers to be locked in for a longer term. These investments in the longer term might diminish the quality of the immediate-term value Benioff wanted to deliver. What then is the plan for profitability and value capture when an entrepreneur invests in execution? After all, they will face competition and, as we saw before, competition can threaten value capture even if competition is great for consumers. The answer is that the entrepreneur intends to profit by having a competitive advantage as a competitor within a market. To be sure, if you produce the same thing as everyone else at the same cost, you should not expect to earn profits. But if you produce a better product (for at least some market segments) at a lower cost, you can earn profits. And if the capabilities that allow you to differentiate your product or deliver it more efficiently require investment and experience cannot be quickly replicated by competitors, then so long as you continue to invest in those capabilities, you can be profitable even in the face of competition and for a long period of time. For Salesforce, they knew that they didn’t have a ‘lock’ on the market. Future innovations would come and compete with them, certainly for specific sales applications. Thus, they knew that they had to continue to 🤜executed well to maintain their market position over time.

## EXECUTION (~60)
- For any given idea and entrepreneur, there will be choices that orient the company more towards competition versus collaboration, and other choices that require the company to invest more in execution versus control.
some entrepreneurs have a strong commitment to “openness,” and so, even if it may be more profitable to pursue a strategy consistent with control, an entrepreneur may prefer an execution strategy in line with their internal values.
- some entrepreneurs have a strong commitment to “openness,” and so, even if it may be more profitable to pursue a strategy consistent with control, an entrepreneur may prefer an execution strategy in line with their internal values
- This is important to faculty who often have limited time to really invest in the type of learning that would be associated with execution.
- Instead, you see how founders face a choice of how to manage that idea though execution (at the expense of control) or vice versa, and the impacts that choice has on the idea’s performance.
- more execution-oriented approach with a higher degree of transparency could result in rich feedback-innovation loop or it could result in imitation and a rapid loss in the potential for competitive advantage.
- For a given idea, there will be choices that orient the company more towards competition versus collaboration, and other choices that require the company to invest more in execution versus control.
- A focus on execution centers on developing and continually building capabilities whereas a focus on control involves pre-emptively making investments to protect a market position.
- choosing between CONTROL VS EXECUTION is identifying how to compete - CONTROL (assess the core idea's riks of imitation) VS EXECUTION (consider the venture's ability to stay ahead of competitors)
-- CONTROL1: The part(s) of the core idea most susceptible to replication (or work around) by others is/are ____ (key value drivers) because …
-- CONTROL2: By contrast, the element(s) of the core idea that will be difficult for others to replicate is/are ___(key value drivers) because …
-- EXECUTION1: Execution and rapid iteration in the market will allow the venture to learn/improve upon ___ (key value drivers). This offers advantage over competitors because …
-- EXECUTION2: Executing quickly requires the venture to invest in acquiring and/or developing (key resources and capabilities) …

- a disruption strategy involves a startup that is focused on execution but is oriented towards competition with established firms in the industry
- how likely is it that directly entering the market, emphasizing execution and customer experimentation over establishing and retaining control over the idea, will elicit sufficiently strong customer feedback and learning to allow the startup to scale without eliciting a timely or effective responsive from established players?
- A disruption startup is, by definition, one that has chosen to take a competitive stance against established firms in the industry while choosing to compete through execution.
- the focus on speed in the face of limited resources requires disruption entrepreneurs to locate near talent pools that can support rapid experimentation and execution.
- there was little to stop others from imitating Netflix with a similar approach so Netflix would have to be better and cheaper than rivals by focusing on execution
- Disruption strategy founders need to come to terms with their value creation hypothesis, as choosing a path of customer feedback-oriented execution requires disclosure of their core idea, which in most cases, is an irreversible decision

## implement

- C1 (intro): this book is about entrepreneurs and their ideas, and the purpose of this book is to provide a coherent strategic framework for considering (and a process for implementing) the core choices facing a startup.
- C3 (Choosing Opportunity): We aim to reshape the unclear and often contradictory debate about the role of strategy and planning in entrepreneurial ventures, and offer a new approach that places the choices that entrepreneurs make about creating and capturing value from their ideas at the center of venture design and implementation
- This missing element may be something that is well-known but not implemented in a particular location or market segment, or it may be something that others had discounted until it was actually offered in the marketplace.
- Without a unique insight into how to create value, an entrepreneur will simply be implementing an existing product or service to existing customers in a standard way. Without a unique insight into how to create value, an entrepreneur will simply be implementing an existing product or service to existing customers in a standard way
- The essence of novelty or uniqueness is that there will therefore be some degree of uncertainty about whether (and how much) value will be created for customers once that opportunity is implemented.
- Because that insight is unique to the entrepreneur, entrepreneurial opportunities are easy for others to discount before they have been implemented (and yet seemingly “obvious” once they have been successfully implemented).
- The first step is recognizing that there is a potential opportunity to be pursued in the first place. Valuable entrepreneurial opportunities are much harder to identify before they have been successfully implemented. To get started, a founder must formulate an entrepreneurial hypothesis—about a new way to create and capture value that others have yet to implement in a successful way. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple, and when Sara Blakely founded Spanx, the unique perspective they brought and their willingness to found a company allowed them to make and implement choices that allowed them to refine and then scale their idea into a commercial product.
- This process in turn allows an entrepreneur to figure out whether to commit to the opportunity in the first place and, perhaps even more critically, make and implement choices that allow them to refine and then scale their idea and build a foundation for advantage.
- individual experience allows entrepreneurs not only to identify a distinctive way to create value but also to better choose and implement an entrepreneurial strategy.
- In essence, passion by an entrepreneur for an opportunity effectively brings down the cost of experimentation and learning by allowing the entrepreneur to combine their own personal interests with the choice and implementation of their entrepreneurial strategy.
- An aspiring entrepreneur that identifies a unique way to create value but lacks an unfair advantage or a passion for that opportunity is unlikely to succeed in implementing what might otherwise be a good idea.
- Identifying potentially valuable opportunities takes practice, and so engaging in proactive opportunity identification (even if the entrepreneur does not commit to implementing that idea) allows an entrepreneur to identify and select better ideas over time.
- Thus, it appeared to be the viable entry point into e-commerce. After this decision point, Bezos focused on implementing his choice.
- Though the choices (i.e., should they enter a growing market and how?) are somewhat similar, established firms, for example, typically make decisions that leverage existing capabilities and strengths, often implementing a proven playbook from one market segment in another.
- C4 (Choosing Strategy) ⭐️In that case, the entrepreneur would consider the value of the implemented idea against the costs (including opportunity costs) of implementation, and so would be able to choose whether or not to invest along the Blue trajectory. If the investment is risky, they might try a limited investment that simultaneously starts the project while also generating meaningful information about its value. If they receive negative information from this limited investment, they are likely to elect to discontinue the project rather than continue with the full investment and implementation of the idea. This approach, known as the real options approach (See BOX: The Real Options Approach) to investing is at the heart of the staged nature of venture capital and many other ways of financing an idea. When you are considering a path (even if there are others you are also considering), you may want to explore when to pursue each alternative. When you pursue a test, it eventually provides you with information. The question is: what will you do with that information? If a test involves commitments that are hard to reverse, then the outcome of the information from that test is whether to continue with the choices embedded within it or to discard the venture altogether. In contrast, if a test does not involve commitments, this adds another option to consider as you receive information from that test: to test or even pursue an alternative path. In this situation, the test involves a real option that allows you to pivot or change course in light of new information rather than just to ‘go’ or ‘stop’ the venture altogether. It is the very fact that information could lead to a different decision that gives that a test its option value.
- C4 (Choosing Strategy) While an important aspect of the process of founding a firm is to conceive of and refine an idea, a separate and equally crucial challenge is to identify and implement a specific approach that will both create and capture value from that idea.
- An important insight from having both many alternatives but tight constraints is that a founding team must undertake some type of search and decision-making process as they launch their venture. This process in itself presents yet another choice. This pursuit might be informal and unstructured (simply implementing the first reasonable plan that comes to mind) or might involve a more structured investigation and comparison of a wide range of alternatives.
- The entrepreneurial choice process forces a team to surface multiple promising options, and gain insight from simply doing so. When the team begins identifying multiple concrete plans that meaningfully realize the potential value of their idea, then they should move beyond search and choose and implement one.
- This is a principal you will see used throughout the book and has been used by countless entrepreneurs in choosing their path to translating their idea into reality. We want to show you how to create a procedure that implements Test Two Choose One as a way of confronting the learning and choice challenges you will inevitably face as you consider a venture.
- Confronting the learning challenge Having confronted the choice challenge by articulating two strategic paths, the entrepreneur is now in a position to test those paths forward. This is the ‘Test 2’ of the ‘Test 2 Choose 1’ approach. There are many ways to explore and learn the potential value of a strategy. However, in the ‘Test 2 Choose 1’ approach, the goal is to learn enough about the two business plans to make a choice and not to resolve all uncertainty. A key part of the learning challenge is that resolving uncertainty without actually implementing a strategy is hard. ... the most important task for a startup at its moment of founding is to not simply “just do it” but instead to learn what “it” to “do.”
- Fyre Festival, a first-of-its-kind musical festival that aimed to bring elite artists and influencers together for a weekend on Norman’s Cay, a beautiful but remote deserted island in the Bahamas. Regardless of the promise of the underlying idea, the practical challenges of implementing the chosen path were essentially insurmountable.
- One particular way to implement a “nail it then scale it approach” is through a choice to limit geographic scope at the earliest stages of a venture
- Third, learn enough to know what to be uncertain about. A significant element of narrowing the cone of uncertainty is learning about what you are uncertain about. When exploring alternative strategies to 🤜implement a novel idea there are a wide range of unknowns and many initial assumptions – even the most critical one may turn out to be false.
- In other words, one does not need to resolve every critical hypothesis prior to implementing an entrepreneurial strategy, but the combination of multiple sources of risk (e.g., greater than 2 sources whose likelihood is relatively low) is likely a signal that the venture is not yet ready to be in a position to attempt to scale. Put another way, a venture seeking to launch their entrepreneurial strategy can allow for one (but not more than one!) “miracle” when choosing to launch a particular entrepreneurial strategy.
- This requires founders to focus their efforts on identifying the most critical hypotheses, assessing those hypotheses in terms of how important and uncertain they are, and designing and implementing tests that meaningfully reduce the cone of uncertainty that allow founders to choose.
- Jeff Bezos considered a wide range of alternative “verticals” to implement his idea of “e-commerce,” ultimately choosing books as the “first best option” because of the large number of items that could be made available online relative to a physical store.
- For each of the examples below, first determine whether each description below refers to an “idea” or a specific strategy for an “idea.” For those that are at the “idea” stage, can you identify an approach that would implement that idea? For those that state a strategy, what is the underlying idea? a. Leveraging reductions in the costs of eco-friendly energy technologies to transition away from fossil fuels (💡), b. An online platform that uses “matched” student reviews to help high school seniors navigate the college application process (💡🤜), c. Reducing the stress and hassle of international air travel (💡), d. Using technology to better service mental health needs(💡), e. Working with local grocery stores to provide specialized meal planning (and ingredient shopping) for recent college graduates (💡🤜)
- Rather than letting customer analytics dictate strategy, customer choice is the first step towards letting a founding team choose and implement their entrepreneurial strategy.
- Ren Ng had dramatically reduced the size of the multi-lens array in a light field camera and proven that the basic elements of a light field camera could be implemented in a palm-sized device roughly the same size and weight of a traditional camera.
- ⭐️For example, early recognition that efforts at exploration have made possible rapid improvements in performance going forward can prompt complementary activities, such as raising capital or implementing other elements of the firm’s overall entrepreneurial strategy.
- Yates first considered founding a gluten-free bakery, with a focus on the development and manufacture of tasty yet gluten-free baked goods. Indeed, over the past several years, this precise strategy has been implemented (occasionally with success) in a range of cities, including Mariposa in the Bay Area.
- Entire fields of management studies are devoted to how complex organizations are managed but here, for startups, the challenge is what to prioritize in simpler organizations in order to implement a strategy to create and capture value.
-  C7 (choose org) ⭐️This is made more difficult by the fact that what a venture does in terms of testing and then 🤜implementing their value creation and capture hypotheses necessarily evolves over the life cycle of the venture.
- Resources are simply the assets that your organization is able to control (or potentially access when needed) that allow an organization to learn about and implement a particular way to create and capture value.
- Though venture capitalists were initially skeptical of the idea (or whether Migicovsky could implement that idea successfully), Migicovsky raised more than $10 million through pre-orders on the Kickstarter platform.
- Arthur Stinchcombe argued that the high rate of failure of new organizations reflected a central challenge facing entrepreneurs: the liability of newness. As has already been emphasized, at the founding moment of a firm, that organization lacks the resources and capabilities that would be required to implement an overall entrepreneurial strategy
- The challenge for Better Place came from another decision. Rather than design and manufacture their own car, Agassi struck deals with existing automakers such as Renault-Nissan to supply cars that did not include a battery Better Place would own and provide those. This would allow them to leverage the existing manufacturers while focus on integrating the new technology. Customers would buy the car and then lease batteries from Better Place at rates that adjusted depending on usage. The problem was this was a novel technology with a novel business model. Changes were inevitable. But it was precisely changes that were difficult to negotiate and 🤜implement with external car providers. [[📜gans20_choose(tech)]]
- An entrepreneur’s organization is how it implements its plans to create and capture value.
- liability of newness presents, even for opportunities that have the potential to create meaningful value, a significant threat to the survival of the venture as the nascent venture lacks the ability to implement an overall entrepreneurial strategy.
- They have only limited resources, and they are considering whether to purchase cutting-edge computers that they can individually customize and adapt to implement their technology, or whether to “rent” computing resources from cloud providers (such as Amazon Web Services or Google) that will allow them to get started immediately (but are less tailored to their individual project).
- However, to capture value, an entrepreneur must choose and implement an approach that allows them to continue to create value for customers above what can be provided by competitors now and in the future giving them scope to also capture that value.
- Software Arts had all the elements of a promising startup, including a great idea, a visionary founder, a solid grasp of customer needs based on experimentation with customers and partners, and a feasible plan of implementation. However, it failed to build a profitable business.
- Kelleher implemented an approach that allowed them to transport individuals across these cities on a lower-cost basis than established airlines.
- Entrepreneurial strategy is, first, the process of considering alternative strategies (putting each strategy to the test) and then choosing and implementing one chosen approach (putting your strategy to work).
- In order to capture value, an entrepreneur must choose and implement an approach that allows them to create value for customers in the face of both existing and potential competition.
- Nadira is arguing to her father that their motel might be far more profitable if they were able to offer a unique approach even if that would cost more money upfront. For example, no lodging within 25 miles offers a fully equipped fitness center. Why might Nadira’s proposal to feature a fitness center allow her family to potentially operate a more profitable motel? What are some potential arguments against her proposal? Beyond simply installing a gym, what would her family need to do in order to implement this proposal?
- COMPETITION: List potential competitors who might be affected by the implementation of the core idea and anticipate their response
- The fundamental challenge in implementing an IP strategy is to manage the disclosure problem.
- Nate Myhrvold for example (Intellectual Ventures)'s case illustrates how IP startup founders need to be comfortable with the fact that sometimes the path to implementing an effective IP strategy is not a particularly friendly one.
- In both situations however, the path towards implementing an intellectual property strategy involves careful planning and clear understanding of how they intend to create and capture value, their four choices, as well as how they will test their underlying hypotheses.
- while other strategies emphasize learning, experimentation and customer selection within the implementation of the strategy, IP startups must develop, at a relatively early stage of their venture, a clear sense of how they will be able to create meaningful value for a well-defined group of final customers in order to make the choices and commitments that allow them to capture value with that customer grouping in mind.
-  Describe one way to “test” whether a potential idea can create value through an intellectual property strategy. What are the potential risks and challenges in implementing this entrepreneurial experiment?
- However, she is uncertain about what else she should be doing to implement an intellectual property-oriented strategy to commercialize her innovation.
- Founders must be able to clearly articulate why their intended customer is unhappy or unserved by offerings from existing firms, and why their idea can be implemented in a way that provides compelling value to one or more groups that are currently unserved (or poorly served) by existing firms.
- Putting a disruptive strategy to work requires that a startup proactively make and implement choices that enhance the chance that both the value creation and value capture conditions can be met.
- To clarify both the power of this approach, and also to identify some of the key challenges in its scope and implementation, we first take a deeper dive into the nature of the value creation and value capture hypotheses, outline the four choices that underlie a disruption strategy, and then define the methods for putting disruption strategy to the test and to work.
- After gathering enough information to choose to pursue a disruption strategy, founders should make and implement choices that enhance the likelihood that they will be able to deliver on their value creation and value capture hypotheses.
- Describe one way to “test” whether a potential idea can create value through a disruption strategy. What are the potential risks and challenges in implementing this entrepreneurial experiment?
- What are the main risks and drawbacks of implementing a disruption strategy? What choices can a start-up make to mitigate these potential challenges? -> FENDING OFF COMPETITORS
- One element of a disruption strategy is a so-called “judo” approach in which a start-up is able to turn what seem to strengths of existing firms into disadvantages that allow the start-up to avoid a direct competitive response. For example, in its earliest days, Netflix took advantage of the fact that since Blockbuster maintained a large retail footprint (which made its stores accessible to nearly all Americans), Blockbuster was reluctant to embrace an “online” model for movie rental (since any Blockbuster sales through that channel likely “cannibalized” their sales from existing retail locations). Can you identify a start-up that has been able to implement this type of “judo” approach? What choices did the start-up make that induced a tradeoff for the established firm? Why did the established firm find it so difficult to respond? What happened to the start-up and established firm over time? -> 🙈🗡️😱 (resistence to change from [[🔮📗gans_power]])
- Infosys team recognized that an Indian software company might have a potential “unfair advantage” arising from the growing number of high-quality English-speaking computer scientists and engineers graduating from India’s best technical universities. Global corporations were rapidly increasing the scale and complexity of their information technology (IT) systems, brining severe implementation challenges.
- 🐬challenge of a value chain strategy is figuring out how to implement the startup’s idea to reinforce and enhance the value chain of an existing incumbent and, at the same time, establish and maintain bargaining power within that value chain.
- Choosing how to assemble and coordinate a team to discover new value in collaboration with an established firm is critical for the successful implementation of a value chain strategy.
- Working collaboratively with a small number of select clients (usually no more than one in any given industry or market), agencies are responsible for creating and implementing the brand strategy, marketing materials and advertising campaigns for the client’s core products and services.
- Because a more fluid versus more structured approach to firm boundaries comes with different benefits and costs, the choice of how to structure firm boundaries is a critical tool for designing and implementing a value chain strategy.
- the challenge of implementing this approach for an entrepreneur is that the well-defined boundaries that allow the start-up to capture value from the relationship may come at the expense of the learning and experimentation that would allow them to identify how to create value for a specific partner in the first place. (자기수준 단정 짓는 과고생)
- In contrast, starting in the mid-1990s under the leadership of John Chambers, Cisco developed and implemented an overall approach to work with start-up innovators. Chambers and his team implemented a multi-layered approach in which Cisco would first identify start-ups working in an area that could be valuable to Cisco.
- Trust. While a formal agreement between a start-up and potential value chain partner is ultimately required to effectively implement a value chain strategy, many value chain entrepreneurs rely at least at first on simply trusting potential partners until an agreement is reached.
- The team is the source of the tacit knowledge that provides insight into how to realize the promise of the innovation, efficiently and creatively solve problems related to implementation, or develop a continuing stream of innovation.
- ability to attract and assemble talent is critical for the ability of a value chain entrepreneur to successfully implement their strategy.
- What are some of the key implementation factors that allow a value chain entrepreneur to succeed over the longer term? Why are each of these important, and what challenges does a start-up face in putting “value chain strategy to work”? (MOD2INTEG)
- Oliver has sought to bring actionable metrics and strategy to established companies who are seeking to realize more diverse, inclusive, and equitable (DEI) workplaces. He has developed a unique metrics-based approach that allows potential partners to assess their historical DEI performance, as well as develop and implement actionable strategies to reach DEI objectives.
- Many value chain entrepreneurs find their ability to grow limited by the relatively narrow scope of their position within the value chain. Many of these firms would like to implement a strategic pivot towards a more control-oriented approach (such as an 🦠intellectual property strategy or even an 🐘architectural strategy where they compete with their former partners). Why might a value chain entrepreneur be interested in this type of strategic pivot? What challenges are they likely to face, and are there specific steps they might undertake to successfully navigate such a transition? [[📜Fine98_clockspeed]]
- As with the other strategies, putting an architectural strategy to work requires making and implementing strategic choices that help increase the likelihood that the key hypotheses for value creation and value capture prove true. This involves putting the strategy to the test, and subsequently putting the strategy to work.
- central challenge of an architectural strategy is choosing and implementing a precise design or approach to enable value creation while also allowing the start-up to maintain sufficient control over that design to capture that value as well.
- The second factor to consider in implementing an architectural strategy is tipping.
- Dropbox’s technological advantages and platform vision were illustrated when, in 2009, Apple’s Steve Jobs met with Dropbox entrepreneurs to discuss a potential acquisition. Houston declined Job’s offer, arguing that his company would grow larger with his platform vision. Job’s disagreed, calling Dropbox “a feature, not a product.” 17 18 months later, Apple announced its own cloud vision, iCloud, which put the cloud at the center of Apple’s ecosystem as a core hub. What is instructive here is that while ultimately Jobs shared Houston’s vision of how a cloud-based storage platform would work, Apple was unable to implement a service as reliable as Dropbox. I
- As an entrepreneur choosing to implement an architectural strategy for translating your idea into a growth business, as with the other strategies it is an important first step to put the key value creation and value capture hypotheses to the test.
- Implementation of an architectural strategy often requires large amounts of upfront investment (especially relative to disruption) in planning and making strategic commitments to build an entirely new value chain.
- Making the design and governance choices, and expending the upfront financial resources to enable this “tipping” process, requires a high initial level of commitment by the start-up and so is associated with a higher level of risk and the potential for failure from the implementation of this entrepreneurial strategy.
- ⭐️Startups pursuing an architectural strategy through the establishment of a new platform bring together multiple “sides” of a market in order to facilitate economic and social transactions that might not otherwise occur. Why is it hard to “learn” about whether a particular platform design creates value before implementing it at some level of scale? (EV!!!)
- What are the core hypotheses that an entrepreneur should seek to test as part of an architectural strategy? What are the challenges of implementing test of these hypotheses in the absence of significant investment and commitment?
- What are some of the key implementation factors that allow an architectural strategy entrepreneur to succeed over the longer term?
- Motivated by a trip to Colonial Williamsburg and her frustration with what was available on the market, American Girl founder Pleasant Rowland wrote a postcard to a good friend: “What do you think of this idea? A series of books about 9-year-old girls growing up in different times in history, with a doll for each of the characters and historically accurate clothes and accessories with which girls could play out the stories?” To implement this idea, Rowland created a small number (three) high-quality emotionally resonant dolls that combined a “back story” rich in historical detail with the opportunity for young girls to play with dolls in an interactive way. Why was it important that Rowland develop “full-fledged” characters and stories to test her value creation hypothesis? Why do you think her initial dolls proved a success, when there were other dolls such as Barbie that already existed in the marketplace? Why do you think that American Doll has been able to sustain itself as a distinctive and unique brand for more than 30 years?
- Once a potential strategy has been identified, high-commitment testing may be necessary to determine whether it is viable and whether it is worth pursuing. This may involve implementing the strategy on a small scale to see how it performs and to gather feedback from customers and other stakeholders.
- Having now identified both the key hypotheses as well as opportunities to experiment and learn about their validity, the next step for the founding team is to identify the concrete actions they could take to begin to not only implement the strategy but also make it more likely that their hypotheses turned out to be true. 
- As a final step, the founding team should evaluate the viability of the entrepreneurial strategy based on the uncertainty associated with key hypotheses as well as the risks involved to effectively make the steps to implement the strategy
- By its nature it is often difficult for entrepreneurs to start to leave behind potential alternatives and confront the associated uncertainty, trade-offs, and implementation risks (🙋‍♀️) head on.
- In a separate set of studies, researchers focused on whether forming concrete hypotheses about the startup idea and undertaking a scientific approach as they implemented their venture would yield benefits to the venture.
- understanding the potential for value creation and capture, as well as the impact of specific choices, allows founders to develop a strategy to realize that potential. In other words, recognizing product-market fit and implementing a specific entrepreneurial strategy are key to success.
- A venture will hire key personnel, leverage resources, and build capabilities to deliver on value creation and capture hypotheses. In other words, implementing the strategy involves maturing the startup into a functional organization.
- Once the core choices within a given entrepreneurial strategy are implemented the costs of “pivoting” rise significantly. When a company, such as online grocer Webvan, founded at the peak of the dot-com boom, implemented a strategy that turned out to be based on faulty assumptions (overestimating the level of demand, underestimating the technological complexities of the warehouse logistics, and underestimating the costs of a competitive online delivery service), they were unable to alter their strategy (i.e., pivot) towards an alternative (such as the cooperative approach pursued by the less capital-intensive Peapod, a startup focused online ordering and delivery for existing grocery stores) even though that alternative was proving to be successful. Webvan’s inability to switch was grounded in the commitments it made to realize its chosen strategy; a position that placed them in opposition to traditional supermarkets (the natural partner under the alternative strategy), costly leases on warehouses and investments in technology, and a mismatch between the expectations raised during their IPO and the smaller and more gradual market growth that would accompany the otherwise profitable alternative. This is, of course, not to say that changes in strategy are not possible once a company implements its initial entrepreneurial strategy. Here are three common scenarios that involve changes in strategy following an initial choice of one strategic path.

3. (Gradual Change) Certain elements of implementation are likely to change as the uncertainty associated with a given strategy are resolved through direct experience. For example, the details of pricing, functional product characteristics, or precise positioning against competitors are all likely to change over time, and depend on the continued learning being undertaken by the venture as it implements the strategy.

4. (Changes in Response to Favorable News) Transitioning strategy to take advantage of the resources and capabilities that are developed over time through the implementation of the initial strategy. For example, a company that is founded within a value chain strategy might find itself in a position to not simply serve as a player in the value chain but indeed architect a new value chain necessitating a transition to an architectural strategy. While Microsoft was founded as essentially a value chain company, Bill Gates ultimately leveraged the contract with IBM as the cornerstone of an architectural strategy in which the Microsoft operating system (first DOS and then Windows) served as the dominant platform of the new personal computing ecosystem. Alternatively, a venture that pursued a disruptive strategy, having proven their customer value proposition and capabilities as a firm, may pivot toward a more collaborative approach in partnership with the established players they formerly competed against. 3. (Changes in Response to Failure) Early feedback that the chosen strategy is not succeeding allows the firm to pivot rapidly away from that strategy. Pinterest initially launched as a mobile-first fashion commerce platform but quickly realized that the primary interests of its users were not in purchasing items through their phones but instead storing collections of items they might prefer to explore further at a later date. CEO Ben Silbermann and his cofounders shifted Pinterest towards an exclusive focus on curating and sharing collections of online content, building a user base of more than 250 million monthly user as of 2019 (though capturing value from these users remains somewhat elusive). Essentially, testing towards the epiphany involves reducing the uncertainty through an experimental approach that tests the core hypotheses underlying an entrepreneurial strategy. This provides the startup with confidence (but not certainty) regarding the value of a particular strategic path. Rather than simply exploring ideas, the choice of a path involves the implementation of that strategy. The clarity of the epiphany comes from the insight that identifying a clear “best path forward” allows the venture to focus on the pursuit of that path rather than struggle about the choice among alternatives.
- Finally, the founding team must make a choice, commit to an entrepreneurial strategy, and begin the steps to implementing that strategy.
- More generally, many entrepreneurs report their reliance on near-term factors in early decisions; rather than reflecting an absence of strategy this pragmatic focus is consistent with the ability of founders to take advantage of near-term opportunities to begin to implement their broader idea.
- By their very nature, start-ups face a wide range of choices, cannot implement all of the options that are theoretically available to them, and face uncertainty at the moment of their founding about the relative value creation and capture associated with at least some of those alternative options.
- To implement this approach, the key would be to establish partnerships with organizations such as the American Heart Association (AHA), the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA), or AARP. While these groups were unlikely to provide a direct revenue stream to RapidSOS, this approach would allow them to gain traction with critical user communities. At the same time, it was unclear whether gaining traction with these early users would translate into a more general transformation of emergency response.
- Implementation Viability What two or three concrete actions could the founders take to develop the idea or increase their hypotheses’ likelihood of being true?
![[Pasted image 20250209113816.png|100]]
- Dilemma: Most new ventures require resources for early experimentation and learning required to explore the opportunity and choose an entrepreneurial strategy as well as to support the commitments required to implement their chosen entrepreneurial strategy.
- Koum and Acton used financing as a tool to implement and scale their entrepreneurial strategy and realize their vision for WhatsApp.
- Financing is a necessary input for key activities – from technology development to manufacturing to the fielding of a sales force – that are required in order to test and implement their overall entrepreneurial strategy, and so attracting investment to the venture becomes the first key tests of the team and its underlying idea. Indeed, in (too) many cases, a focus on raising capital becomes almost an end in itself rather than as a tool that allows the founders to create and capture value from their idea through the implementation of an overall entrepreneurial strategy.
- Undertaking primary market research to assess alternative customer groups, experiments to compare alternative technologies, and building prototypes to gain early customer feedback all require real resources, and so a primary function of early-stage finance is to facilitate the process of entrepreneurial experimentation that allows a venture to choose and implement a coherent entrepreneurial strategy. Tony Hsieh, the founder of the online shoe store, Zappos, recalls that, during the recession of 2000, with rapidly dwindling resources and an already-pared down staff, he asked early employee Fred Mossler to envision a deus ex machina – a fundamentally new “bet the company” plan that would Hsieh and his team to figure out if their idea would actually succeed. After listening to Mossler’s proposed experiment to enhance the online shoe purchasing experience through significant investment in inventory, Hsieh recounts that he was willing to invest the remainder of his own personal financial resources in order to “either save Zappo’s or ensure our speedy demise.” Concretely, risk capital in an early-stage venture facilitates the resolution of uncertainty.
- At the same time, capital allows start-ups to make the commitments to implement their entrepreneurial strategy. Once a strategy has been selected, investment capital may be required to establish a supply chain., marketing and distribution channels, or implement particular features or services that allow the venture to deliver value to customers. In contrast to investments in order to learn to make informed choices, this second role for investment is about implementing choices that have already been made.
- Clarifying both the types and sequencing of required capital is a central challenge in the development and implementation of an overall entrepreneurial strategy:proactive choice by founders to choose their investors helps facilitate alignment between fundraising and strategy.

- For many start-ups, however, choosing and implementing their strategy requires significant upfront capital. Obtaining financing both allows a venture to engage in learning and experimentation in advance of commitments to particular customers (or other elements of their entrepreneurial strategy), and provides the resources a new venture needs to implement their entrepreneurial strategy once it has been chosen.
- Self-financing: For founders with liquid assets, one possibility is to selffinance the early stages of a venture. Self-financing has the advantage of being simple to implement (one need not negotiate over the equity split with oneself), and helps members of a founding team clarify their level of personal commitment.
- As well, equity crowdfunding requires far more disclosure and transparency than traditional crowdfunding, insofar as the only information that a founding team needs to provide backers of a non-equity project are details about the product or service that has been preordered, while equity crowdfunding requires far more transparency about the exploration and implementation of the venture’s entrepreneurial strategy.
- . By focusing exclusively on idea production and having the independent ventures control strategy and implementation (resulting in a history of both hits and misses), Langer-affiliated start-ups have achieved more than $30 billion of market value as of 2018.
- Early enthusiasm over this partnership turned to frustration as Eberhard was sidelined over time (he left Tesla in 2007), and Musk himself took over greater managerial control; though Eberhard benefited financially from his involvement in Tesla, the initial investment from Elon Musk limited his career trajectory within Tesla (and perhaps more broadly). Not simply a matter of career ambitions, ceding control also implies loss of authority over the choice and implementation of the venture’s entrepreneurial strategy. Key entrepreneurial strategy choices are resolved not only through analysis of what is best for the financial viability of a venture, but which of several alternatives best allows the decisionmaker to realize their broader objectives for the venture (e.g., which customers to serve, which technology to leverage, and what type of team to build?).
- To be clear, risk capital might be necessary to fund the experimentation and learning that allows the choice of entrepreneurial strategy. It is important to remember that raising capital is not an end in itself but, instead, is serving the process of choosing and then implementing the overall entrepreneurial strategy.
- Latitude regarding the sequencing and timing of investment offers a powerful way for founders to align the funding of their venture and their exploration, choice and implementation of their entrepreneurial strategy.
- he amount of financing required to implement an experiment is itself uncertain; the provision of a small amount of “bridge financing” (often in the form of a loan) between two formal rounds of equity financing can be used to allow an entrepreneurial experiment to come to fruition, allowing for learning that informs the next step of strategic choice.
- each of these features reflects two core lessons regarding entrepreneurial finance. First, attracting risk capital is qualitatively different in nature than raising investment capital: while risk capital is aimed at undertaking experimentation and learning to choose an entrepreneurial, investment capital is aimed towards implementing that strategy. Second, though both founders and investors share an interest in choosing and implementing a successful strategy, this alignment is not perfect, as investors have an interest in not only helping to enhance the value of the firm but also weaken the power and centrality of the founding team.
- When made effectively, the choice of financing supports early experimentation and learning, and, ultimately the implementation and scaling of the chosen entrepreneurial strategy. A strategic approach aligns the choice of financing at each stage with the critical set of experiments required to assess the overall viability of the opportunity and choose an entrepreneurial strategy and then the commitments required to effectively implement that strategy while understanding the potential tradeoffs, including the potential for the founders to cede their control and ability to choose the direction of the venture.
- Once an entrepreneurial strategy has been chosen, investment capital allows the venture to establish capabilities or implement features to deliver value to the custom
- Latitude regarding the sequencing and timing of investment offers a powerful way for founders to align the funding of their venture and their learning and experimentation, choice of a entrepreneurial strategy, and the implementation of that strategy.
- Bootstrapping / Internal Funding How could the startup potentially bootstrap while implementing the chosen strategy?
- After successfully implementing an entrepreneurial strategy, an entrepreneur must make an active choice to scale
- With that said, the Penrose Effect is perhaps most impactful on start-ups. On the one hand, to test and implement their overall entrepreneurial strategy to create and capture value, a new firm needs in nearly all cases to attract or acquire new resources and capabilities beyond those under its control at the time of founding. On the other hand, the process of attracting and acquiring resources itself takes time and attention away from implementing the strategy itself.
- In most cases, this allows the organization to be highly fluid and flexible, leverage the strengths that the individual founders bring to the venture, and perhaps delay some elements of implementation for those activities where the founders have less experience or skill.
- Each change in the organization takes time and attention to implement, and some choices may need to be reconsidered (or even reversed). Moreover, different members of the founding team (or even early employees or investors) might disagree about whether a particular organizational approach is effective or not, or what role they would like to play in the growing firm. There may be competing visions as to the importance, and relative power, of different stakeholders and functional areas (i.e., sales, R&D). As a consequence, rather than simply reflecting the smooth and regular implementation of a pre-existing plan, the process of growth can often be chaotic and conflictual.
- Clarity about which choices are most important (and when), and guidance about how to implement those choices effectively, enables an entrepreneur to focus on those aspects of the organization that are most critical for the successful growth of the firm.
- Those startups which lacked structure or were unable to develop a positive culture were associated with a much lower rate of success: for example, companies that failed to develop a formal organizational structure succeeded at less than half the rate of those that had been able to implement a structured organizational design.13
- A playbook at least in principle allows founders to be more systematic in pursuing growth and more effective in implementing the organizational choices they make along their growth trajectory.
- onsider OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation service founded in 1998 by Chuck Templeton. While the basic concept behind Open Table was straightforward – enabling diners to make online reservations with the restaurant of their choice in the local area – the implementation of this idea was more challenging.
- As such, the logic of a growth playbook provides founders with clear guidance about how to focus their scarce time and effort: identify the most important resources and capabilities that are required (and then implement a systematic approach for actually attracting, acquiring and building those resources and capabilities for use by the firm in the process of value delivery).
- After successfully implementing an entrepreneurial strategy, an entrepreneur must make an active choice to scale. Choosing to scale only occurs when the founding team makes choices to grow, such as hiring new employees, seeking new investors, or building out an element of their supply chain.
- Erik has launched an event managements platform (automating processes for event planning that traditionally take hours into minutes), and has successfully implemented the first stages of his entrepreneurial strategy where he has created a valuable offering that allows couples to efficiently coordinate their wedding venue and vendors.
- But in a toy industry used to selling cheaper products in a mass scale implementing that vision would require a distinct retailing approach. So, in that pre-Internet era, Rowland chose to sell them herself through a catalogue; something that allowed her to structure the marketing of the dolls around her historical vision.

no "execution", one "implement"
- "The net result was that early supply chain designs, 🤜implemented by engineers solely focused on the technological performance of the sourced components, were a key factor in preventing the company from meeting critical targets set by its capital suppliers."

- C1: Part III of the book focuses on 🤜implementation... I offer not just a theory of industry clockspeed and business genetics, but a wealth of case histories that illustrate its principles. Moreover, I present concrete, practical tools of analysis and 🤜implementation.
- C6: Think of Fidelity mutual funds as a developer of applications (tools to be used over the World Wide Web) to sell financial services to their customers over the Internet. Finally, as the last link in the chain, consider an individual investor who continually fine-tunes her portfolio strategy and uses Fidelity’s Web tool to 🤜implement her resulting investment changes. The clockspeed here is very high: Such mutual fund strategies seem to change almost as frequently as the Wall Street Journal is published.
- C7: Chrysler and Kitty Litter: Consider Chrysler Corporation. During the 1990s, Chrysler became a corporate pacesetter in making supply chain design a core competence of the corporation. The leader of this endeavor was Thomas Stallkamp, who designed and 🤜executed this process as executive vice president of procurement and supply.
-  C8: even the widely respected Toyota struggled when it tried to implement global three-dimensional concurrent engineering from a highly integral supply base.
- C8: A software company can 🤜implement full assembly and testing of a product prototype once every 24 hours if it wishes, even though the software engineers may work in dispersed facilities across several continents.
- C9: The next chapter explores some of the tools for 🤜implementing 3-DCE; two additional examples of supply chain design and control are provided in chapter 11.
- C10: To 🤜implement clockspeed concepts, you don’t have to blow up the organization and start over. You can build on existing tools in the kit. most managers realize that 🤜implementing new ideas into existing business processes can prove to be exceedingly challenging. The good news is that the implementation of clockspeed and 3-DCE ideas does not require radical surgery in organizational processes.
- C10: Instead of such a radical solution, even as an antidote to it, I advocate leveraging one basic organizational methodology, variously referred to as concurrent engineering, the product development process, design-build teams, or integrated product teams (IPTs), as the core of the 🤜implementation process for three-dimensional concurrent engineering.
- C10: Bundling offers several advantages over separate-sales arrangements: It enables complete control of the product and the 🤜implementation of the design, in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices.
- C11: To stay competitive, then, HP must depend on its ability to design 🤜implementation processes whose increase in cost is less than the perceived increased value customers see in the unbundled software product.
- C11: To proceed, HP must eliminate the dependence of its software on its hardware. HP must also develop 🤜implementation processes that can be performed by any partner.
- C11: You then can begin 🤜implementing your decisions within the framework of existing concurrent engineering tools (chapter 10), provided that strategic thinking authority is integrated within the concurrent engineering processes.
- C11: Most of Intel’s growth to a $25 billion corporation occurred over less than a decade, a period during which the company built highly capital-intensive factories and introduced new products at a blistering pace. Much of its success in keeping competitors at bay during the period of explosive growth resulted from the ability to 🤜executed new product and process development with many new suppliers at breakneck speed.
  
- Chrysler will have to reinvest some of its bounteous profits into deeper 3-D systems integration skills, particularly in integrating the process development activities with the advantages the company has already gained through its system of product-supply chain modularity. This system is so well 🤜executed that it has been christened the “new American keiretsu,” 165 drawing an analogy to Toyota’s effective use of outsourced subsystem development.
- Toyota is a master of capability development and utilization. Although it relies heavily on outsourcing, it also maintains world-class levels of expertise in all of the capabilities it deems critical in the chain. It 🤜executes very well a strategic make/buy policy on core capabilities complemented with continual capability upgrading in all three of the dimensions of product, process, and supply chain. Consider these experiences in process, product, and supply chain development that illustrate how Toyota continuously strengthens and deepens its capabilities.
- C11: HP must be sure that the final product works and performs adequately to ensure the patient’s safety. In an unbundled environment, HP has less direct control over the integration of its products, and liability risks will increase if processes are not performed properly. It will require a way to control that liability in carefully written contracts, “idiot-proof” tests for product quality which are easily  🤜executed and assessed, and methods for auditing customer use of the system.
- C12: In step 4, you begin to 🤜execute the capability development process through the use of three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3-DCE). Analysis of product, process, and supply chain architectures enables you to sharpen your analysis of a strategy for outsourcing certain components if necessary.
