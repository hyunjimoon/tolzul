1. **Identify Section Headings (or major thematic segments)**
    
    - Parse the paper’s organizational units (sections, subsections, or main thematic blocks).
    - These will become rows in the final table.

2. **Extract Key Information for Each Section**
    
    - For each section, pose a “research question” or “core focus” (some statement of the motivating inquiry).
    - Summarize the **key message** that addresses that research question (the fundamental insight, argument, or conclusion).
    - Note any relevant **figures/examples** or conceptual “boxes” that illustrate the point.
    - Collect **literature references** or classic influences used in that section, if appropriate.

3. **Populate a Table With Columns Mirroring #📜vul one and done**
    
    - Create columns such as:
        1. **Section / Subsection**
        2. **🔐Research Question**: Key research questions being addressed, Conceptual underpinning
        3. **🔑Key Message**- Theoretical Framework 🗺️: 
        4.   📐Mathematical Formalization: Equations, models, and formal definitions
-       5. 📊empirical Evidence : Data, figures, and statistical results
        6. **🧱Literature Brick** (citations, references, or prior theories)
    - Summarize each section into the table row, ensuring the “granularity” matches the level of detail in #📜vul one and done.

4. MAKE SURE!!! the output is in ONE markdown TABLE format with each section of the paper as one row. MAKE SURE EMOJIS inserted in the table is helping reader absorb intuitive message of the paper. emoji's symbolic meaning the readers are comfortable with is in 🧍‍♀️🌏🧭🗺️.md - make sure you fully understand their symbolic meaning. EXAMPLE is in 📜Vul14_onedone.md.

5. Organization Rules for 🗄️table.
cohesive column-wise structure and row-wise structure. what i mean by that is, if you choose any two rows and two columns and call the four cells A (row1, col1), B (row1, col2), C (row2, col1), D (row2, col2), then A:B = C:D (row wise cohesiveness) and A:C = B:D (column wise cohesiveness) should hold.

- Each row should represent a complete research phase
- Mathematical components should be linked to their theoretical foundations
- Figures should be explained in context of their role in supporting findings
- Mechanisms should be connected to both theory and empirical evidence
- All quantitative effects should include units and magnitudes
- Key variables should be defined where they first appear

6. Integration Guidelines:
- Use arrows (→) to show causal relationships
- Use bullets (•) for listing related components
- Include symbols with their definitions
- Link visual evidence to theoretical predictions
- Connect mechanisms to outcomes
- Show relationships between different research phases

This framework ensures:
- Complete coverage of all research elements
- Clear logical flow from theory to evidence
- Integration of mathematical and empirical components
- Context for visual evidence
- Connection between mechanisms and outcomes
