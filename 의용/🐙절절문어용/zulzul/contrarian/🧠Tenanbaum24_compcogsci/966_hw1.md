I like visual representation so mapped each concept and each subproblem as below.

| Concept                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Emoji |

### ⚫️1.A. Data X
#### (i) Collect and attach 4 datasets with modified cover stories

freshly-minted quarters scenario below potentially bias towards fairness.
> Your younger sibling is preparing for the school science fair and has chosen to do a project on probability and coin flips. To ensure the experiment's accuracy, your parents took you both to the bank to get fresh rolls of quarters (just minted!). You flip each coin a few times and observe the sequences of 'heads' vs 'tails' outcomes shown below. 
   For each of the following sequences, please judge how likely you think the coin is to be a fair coin (tends to land heads half the time and tails half the time) or an unfair coin (tends to land on one side more often than the other). Use a 1-7 rating scale, where 1 means 'definitely unfair' and 7 means 'definitely fair'. Remember, each sequence comes from a different coin, so try not to let your judgment of one coin influence your thoughts about the others."

Four datasets were collected: self and participant ratings for each condition. To minimize bias from myself being the test subject and evaluator (e.g. previous rating being the reference point so that intentionally assigning more surprising for fairer coin situation for consecutive heads), I used temporal separation strategy. I completed the base condition assessment immediately upon receiving the problem set, then waited until a specific later date to assess the fairer condition. I expected bank story to have a higher rating for fairness.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

df = pd.read_csv("coin_flip_data.csv")
print(df[["sequence", "neutral_self", "neutral_participant", "bank_self", "bank_participant"]])
```

#### (ii) Analyze systematic differences in ratings between conditions

To analyze the differences between conditions, I calculated the average rating for each sequence within each condition. The results show that the relative ratings follow a similar pattern in both conditions. For sequences of the same length, the first coin is consistently rated as fairer than the second, which in turn is rated fairer than the third. An interesting observation is that for Coin #6 (a sequence of all tails), both participants gave it a fairness rating of 1 in the neutral condition, but a rating of 3 in the bank condition. This suggests that the bank context might have a stronger effect on judgments for medium-length sequences that appear highly biased. Here are the average ratings for each condition:

```python
list(zip(df.filter(like="base").mean(axis=1), df.filter(like="bank", mean(axis=1)))
# [(6.0, 4.5), (4.5, 4.0), (2.0, 2.5), (6.0, 6.0), (3.5, 3.5), (1.0, 3.0), (7.0, 6.0), (4.0, 4.5), (1.0, 1.5)]
```


#### (iii) Compare differences to expectations

First, I thought that the order of how fair people thought the coins were would stay the same in both the neutral and bank scenarios. For example, if people thought Coin A was fairer than Coin B in the neutral scenario, I expected they'd think the same in the bank scenario too. That part turned out to be true!

I also thought that when people heard the coins came from a bank, they'd generally think all the coins were a bit fairer. if my hypothesis was right, we'd expect to see a negative number here. That would mean the bank scenario ratings were higher (fairer) than the neutral scenario ratings. But when I ran the numbers, I got a negative number with tiny absolute value , - 0.056. it suggests that mentioning the bank didn't really make people think the coins were fairer overall. It's a surprise!
```python
rating_difference = np.mean(df.filter(like="neutral").mean(axis=1) - df.filter(like="bank").mean(axis=1))
print(f"Mean rating difference (Neutral - Bank): {rating_difference:.4f}")
# -0.056
```

### 🟦1.B. Posterior odds
#### (i) Plot transformed model predictions vs human data, report correlation

Let's dive🤿 into the exciting world of comparing our model to real human judgments! 

We created a nifty Bayesian model that calculates how likely each coin sequence is under two scenarios: a fair coin and a biased coin. Then, we use some mathematical magic 🪄(sigmoid) to transform these calculations into a 1-7 scale, just like our human participants used. Here's the cool part: we're going to plot these model predictions against what our human participants actually said. We'll do this for both the neutral and bank conditions. The closer our points are to a diagonal line, the better our model matches human intuition!

```python
def fair_prob(seq): return 1 / (2**len(seq))
def weighted_prob(seq):
    n_heads = sum(np.array(list(seq)) == "H")
    theta = np.linspace(0, 1, num=100)
    return np.mean((theta**n_heads) * ((1-theta)**(len(seq)-n_heads)))

Our points are clustering pretty close to that line, which is fantastic news. It means our model is doing a good job of capturing human intuition about coin fairness.

#### (ii) Find best settings for parameters a and b

'a' and 'b', two parameters help our model match human judgments even better. To find the best values, we're going to try lots of different combinations and see which ones work best i.e. grid search to optimize transformation parameters:

```python
def grid_search(condition):
    best_mse = float('inf')
    for a in np.linspace(0, 5, 50):
        for b in np.linspace(-3, 3, 50):
            transformed = transform_predictions(log_posterior_odds, a, b)
            mse = np.mean((transformed - df[condition].mean(axis=1))**2)
            if mse < best_mse:
                best_mse, best_a, best_b = mse, a, b
    print(f"{condition}: a = {best_a:.2f}, b = {best_b:.2f}, MSE = {best_mse:.4f}")
    return best_a, best_b

neutral_a, neutral_b = grid_search("neutral")
bank_a, bank_b = grid_search("bank")
```

we got a = 1.02 and b = -0.68. For the bank condition, a = 0.21 and b = -0.44.
#### (iii) Compare and contrast human and model judgments qualitatively

Calculated Spearman rank correlations using optimized parameters:

```python
for condition, (a, b) in [("neutral", (neutral_a, neutral_b)), ("bank", (bank_a, bank_b))]:
    transformed = transform_predictions(log_posterior_odds, a, b)
    corr, _ = spearmanr(transformed, df[condition].mean(axis=1))
    print(f"{condition.capitalize()} Spearman correlation: {corr:.2f}")
```

We got correlations of 0.92 for the neutral condition and 0.84 for the bank condition. It means our model is doing a good job of mimicking how humans rank the fairness of different coin sequences. The slightly lower score for the bank condition hints that there might be some subtle effects of context that our model doesn't quite capture yet. 

Certainly. I'll revise the explanation for 1.C to maintain a more balanced tone - engaging but also more professionally informative. Here's the updated version:

### 🟩1.C. Prior Sensitivity

#### (i) Analyze effect of varying P(H1) on model predictions with plots

To understand how varying the prior probability of a fair coin (P(H1)) affects our model's predictions, we plotted the log prior odds for different values of P(H1):

```python
ph1 = np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 100)
log_prior_odds = np.log(ph1 / (1 - ph1))

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(ph1, log_prior_odds)
plt.xlabel("P(H1)")
plt.ylabel("Log prior odds")
plt.title("Effect of P(H1) on log prior odds")
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.axvline(x=0.5, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.show()
```

![[Pasted image 20240930224235.png|300]]
This plot illustrates that as P(H1) increases, representing a stronger prior belief in fair coins, the log prior odds increase. When P(H1) > 0.5, the log prior odds become positive, indicating a preference for the fair coin hypothesis. Consequently, stronger evidence of unfairness (e.g. HHHHHHHHHH) would be necessary to conclude that a coin is unfair when starting with a higher P(H1). 

Less related but, this reminds me that theory is positively appraised when it predicts "Damn strange coincidence" from Meehl's _Appraising and Amending Theories: The Strategy of Lakatosian Defense and Two Principles That Warrant It_. i.e. make the bets against the odd and win big.
#### (ii) Find best P(H1) value for each cover story condition

Determining the optimal P(H1) that best aligns with human data is challenging due to the presence of free parameters a and b in our model. To address this, we adopted an approach that evaluates the model's performance across a range of P(H1) values while considering various combinations of a and b.

Our method involves examining the distribution of Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each P(H1) value across a grid of a and b combinations. The rationale behind this approach is that P(H1) values closer to the true underlying prior should exhibit lower sensitivity to variations in a and b, potentially resulting in lower overall MSE.

```python
def evaluate_ph1(condition):
    ph1_values = np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 20)
    mse_stats = []
    for ph1 in ph1_values:
        log_post_odds = log_posterior_odds + np.log(ph1 / (1 - ph1))
        mses = [np.mean((transform_predictions(log_post_odds, a, b) - df[condition].mean(axis=1))**2)
                for a in np.linspace(0, 5, 10) for b in np.linspace(-3, 3, 10)]
        mse_stats.append((np.mean(mses), np.std(mses)))
    
    means, stds = zip(*mse_stats)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.errorbar(ph1_values, means, yerr=stds, capsize=5)
    plt.xlabel("P(H1)")
    plt.ylabel("Mean MSE")
    plt.title(f"{condition.capitalize()} - Model performance vs P(H1)")
    plt.show()
    
    best_ph1 = ph1_values[np.argmin(means)]
    print(f"Optimal P(H1) for {condition}: {best_ph1:.2f}")

evaluate_ph1("neutral")
evaluate_ph1("bank")
```
![[Pasted image 20240930225740.png|500]]
The results indicate that for both conditions, the optimal P(H1) values fall within the range of 0.55-0.65. This suggests that participants in both conditions harbored a slight prior belief that the coins were more likely to be fair than unfair. Interestingly, the bank condition showed a marginally higher optimal P(H1), which aligns with our initial hypothesis that the bank context might increase the belief in fairness. However, it's important to note that this difference is smaller than initially anticipated, indicating that the context may have a more subtle effect on prior beliefs than we first supposed.

These findings provide valuable insights into how contextual information might influence people's prior beliefs about coin fairness, and how these beliefs interact with observed evidence to shape overall judgments. The relatively small difference between conditions also highlights the robustness of people's prior beliefs about coin fairness, suggesting that such beliefs may be quite stable across different contexts.

### ⬛️1.D. Identify limitations of hypothesis space and provide examples

Our model's hypothesis space exhibits two primary limitations:

1. Representativeness heuristic: The model fails to account for the human tendency to judge sequence fairness based on perceived randomness rather than solely on the proportion of heads to tails. For instance, while sequences HHHTTT and HTHHTH have identical probabilities under both fair and unfair coin hypotheses, human participants may judge HTHHTH as fairer due to its apparently more random arrangement.
2. Simplistic prior for unfair coins: Our model assumes a uniform prior over all possible biases for unfair coins. This assumption may not accurately reflect human intuition. In reality, people might have more nuanced priors, potentially believing that slightly unfair coins (e.g., 55% heads) are more prevalent than extremely biased coins (e.g., 99% heads).

To address these limitations, future iterations of the model could:

1. Incorporate a measure of sequence complexity or randomness.
2. Implement a more sophisticated prior for unfair coins, such as a beta distribution that favors moderate biases over extreme ones.

### 🟦2.A. Manually compute posterior probabilities for two hypotheses

Given:
h1: "multiples of 5"
h2: "even numbers"
D = {10, 20, 30}
P(h1) = P(h2) = 0.5
|h1| = 10, |h2| = 50

P(D|h1) = (1/10)^3 = <font color  = "red">1/1000</font>
P(D|h2) = (1/50)^3 = <font color  = "red">1/125000</font>
P(D) = <font color  = "red"> (1/1000 + 1/125000)</font> * <font color  = "green">.5</font> = <font color  = "plum">0.000504</font>

<font color  = "blue"> P(h1|D) =  (<font color  = "red">1/1000</font> * <font color  = "green">.5</font>) /  <font color  = "plum">0.000504</font> ≈ 0.992</font>
<font color  = "blue">P(h2|D) = (<font color  = "red">1/125000</font> * <font color  = "green">.5</font>) /  <font color  = "plum">0.000504</font> ≈ 0.008</font>

### ⭐️2.B. Manually compute probability of concept containing number 40

P(40 ∈ C | D) = P(40 ∈ C | h1)P(h1|D) + P(40 ∈ C | h2)P(h2|D)
               = 1 * 0.992 + 1 * 0.008 = 1

### 🔴2.C. Implement log likelihood function for given dataset and hypothesis

```python
def number_game_likelihood(hypothesis, data):
    if not all(d in hypothesis for d in data):
        return -np.inf
    return -len(data) * np.log(len(hypothesis))

# Example usage
multiples_of_5 = set(range(5, 101, 5))
even_numbers = set(range(2, 101, 2))

data = [10, 20, 30]
print(f"Log-likelihood for multiples of 5: {log_likelihood(multiples_of_5, data)}")
print(f"Log-likelihood for even numbers: {log_likelihood(even_numbers, data)}")
```

### 🟦2.D.
#### (i) Generate plots for given datasets and analyze

```python
import moon_number_game as ng

hypotheses, priors = ng.number_game_simple_init(100, 0.5, 0.5)
ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, [60, 52, 57, 55])
ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, [16, 8, 2, 64])
```
![[Pasted image 20240930233537.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240930233508.png|300]]
Analysis: The first dataset shows a concentration around multiples of 5, while the second shows a strong bias towards powers of 2.

<font color  = "blue">Q. why does the first one has top four while the second one has top one?</font>
#### (ii) Generate sequential plots to show how new data changes distribution

We generate plots for a sequence of datasets to observe how new data affects the distribution:
```python
datasets = [[80], [80, 10], [80, 10, 60], [80, 10, 60, 30]]
for data in datasets:
    ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, data)
```
![[Pasted image 20240930234329.png]]
Analysis: With only [80], the distribution shows a peak around 80 with some diffusion to nearby numbers. Adding 10 shifts the focus to multiples of 10, with [80, 10, 60] further reinforcing this pattern. The final dataset [80, 10, 60, 30] strongly suggests a "multiples of 10" concept, with the highest peaks at these observed values.

#### (iii) Experiment with alternative prior settings and explain effects
We explore the effects of different prior settings on the model's predictions:
```python
prior_settings = [(0.8, 0.2), (0.2, 0.8), (0.999, 0.001)]
for interval_prior, math_prior in prior_settings:
    hypotheses, priors = ng.number_game_simple_init(100, interval_prior, math_prior)
    ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, [80])
```
![[Pasted image 20240930234625.png]]

Example 1: With a moderately high interval prior, the model shows a localized distribution around the observed number, with some diffusion to nearby values.

Example 2: When we assign more weight to mathematical concepts, the distribution becomes more dispersed across the range, considering various mathematical relationships (e.g., multiples, factors) related to the observed number.

Example 3: In the extreme case of a very high interval prior, the distribution becomes tightly focused on the immediate vicinity of the observed number, with minimal generalization to other values.

These examples illustrate how different prior weightings can dramatically alter the model's predictions and generalization patterns in the Number Game task.

#### (iv) Determine which prior settings best capture human data

```python
hypotheses, priors = ng.number_game_simple_init(100, 0.75, 0.25)
ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, [60])

hypotheses, priors = ng.number_game_simple_init(100, 0.9, 0.1)
ng.number_game_plot_predictions(hypotheses, priors, [16])
```

![[Pasted image 20240930234859.png|300]]
Analysis: For [60], a 75% interval prior and 25% math prior best fits human data. For [16], a 90% interval prior and 10% math prior works best.
60 seems to trigger multiples of 10 more compared to 16 (which triggers e.g. power of 2)

### 2.E. 
#### (i) Explain how Marr's levels apply to the number game

Computational level: The number game models human concept learning and generalization.
Algorithmic level: Bayesian inference over a structured hypothesis space.
Implementation level: Not addressed by the number game model.

#### (ii) Discuss aspects of human concept learning captured by the Number Game

The Number Game captures:
1. Rapid generalization from few examples
2. Sensitivity to prior knowledge
3. Context-dependent hypothesis formation
4. Size principle in weighing hypotheses

#### (iii) Evaluate ecological relevance of the number game task

The Number Game is ecologically relevant as it mimics real-world concept learning scenarios, using familiar number concepts and requiring inference from limited data.

#### (iv) Discuss origin and potential differences in hypothesis spaces across participants

Hypothesis spaces likely originate from educational experiences and everyday encounters with number patterns. Differences may arise from:
1. Cultural background (e.g. my guess is eastern culture has more similarity gradient..?)
2. Mathematical education level
3. Personal experiences with numbers (e.g., professions involving specific number patterns)
4. Individual cognitive styles (e.g., preference for concrete vs. abstract thinking)
