| **What** | A mathematical metric that quantifies the optimal balance between market understanding and technological innovation, calculated as PBR = (n*/Î±)Â·(Î¼-0.5)                                                                                                                  |
| **Why**  | Entrepreneurs need a decision tool that determines whether to shape market preferences through innovation or adapt to existing needs, based on their prior beliefs and confidence levels                                                                                 |
| **How**  | PBR works by comparing the ratio of optimal sample size to prior confidence, weighted by optimism level, to indicate whether more testing is justified and in which direction (positive values favor preference shaping; negative values favor preference accommodating) |
