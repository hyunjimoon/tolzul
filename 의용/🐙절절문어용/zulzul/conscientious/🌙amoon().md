# 🌙 Angie Moon's Research Journey

I'm a Ph.D. at MIT studying innovation and operations management with [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/),  [Scott Stern](https://www.scott-stern.com/), [Vikash Mansinghka](https://probcomp-test211190.csail.mit.edu/talks/). My past and future in [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fa14fcd5ihdq014k6v4h0/Angie-Moon-Resume.pdf?rlkey=y7eerk8e6yx028es2rq7vjmid&dl=0). 

I use probability, statistics, optimization theory to model entrepreneurial decision making. My main tool is probabilistic program. 

I desire to contribute to building the [[♻️world]] where every knows and acts to live an ergodic life. That's my [[🔴sun]] and surprise surprise, I'm the guinea pig.

I'm currently a Ph.D. at MIT, majoring operations and innovation management, advised by   This is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6t0kx5e2ooggahr98va37/Angie_Moon_resume.pdf?rlkey=sqgkvokf2sunj5fash96asnto&dl=0).

My  vision is to bridge Bayesian and evolutionary entrepreneurship with probabilistic program.

Angie agent and the world
	- desire: living ergodic life by making my operations and innovation management theory usable by establishing [[👓synthesize(ops4innov)]]
	-  [[🌙amoon()]] shows Bayes is my religion, simulation forms me. 
	- [[♻️world]] archives the world around me

Angie agent's language 
	- startup ([[def(nextopt)]] CEO)
	- education community (textbook Bayesian Data Analysis translators)
	- open-source ([Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/), [SBC](https://hyunjimoon.github.io/SBC/)). 
	- [[[Simulation Justification]]]

After defining my life goal with five functions,  interacting with amazing people ([[🤹‍♀️atom(bit)]]) in allowed me to set object as [[🌙human(tolzul)]], [[🗺️explain(entrepreneuring)]], [[👓synthesize(ops4innov)]], [[🧭predict(entrepreneuring)]]. [[def(walkie-talkie)]] is my ritual to exchange bits and atoms with the [[🤹‍♀️atom(bit)]] I feel attached to.

- 2024 summer, i'm delving into: how to detect people who has absorptive capacity? (JB>Charlie>Matt>Josh>Scott)
----

E: PCS-[A: BES -> S: BEF]-> T: PCF
educator + archivist2synthesizer = transporter

- a person is an atomized bit, modularized thoughts that are mostly consistent 
- I decipher signals (e.g. writings and voice) to learn their bit/soul
- based on the following label of person's function into one of the four quadrants
- each person I label people's function into one of the four quadrants

how bits and atoms differ especially in their management?
