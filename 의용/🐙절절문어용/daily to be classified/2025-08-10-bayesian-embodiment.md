        🐢 Can?                👾 User?
   Embody theory via         Entrepreneurs need
   physical analogies        probabilistic tools
   (sports, movement,        to navigate
   sensory experience)       uncertainty
              \                  /
               \                /
         Deliver? ←→  Sell?
                /              \
               /                \
        🐅 Goal?              🐙 Offer?  
    Bridge abstract          Bayesian entrepreneurship
    probabilistic theory     framework: decisions as
    with embodied wisdom     embodied experiments
```

**Deliver**: 🐅×🐢 = ✓ Physical analogies make abstract probability concepts intuitive
**Sell**: 👾×🐙 = ✓ Entrepreneurs resonate with experiential learning approaches
**$/time**: ✓ High leverage through embodied understanding accelerates decision-making

**Learning**: Probabilistic computing becomes entrepreneurial when we ground abstract Bayesian concepts in physical experiences - like tennis teaching timing/uncertainty or swimming teaching flow states
