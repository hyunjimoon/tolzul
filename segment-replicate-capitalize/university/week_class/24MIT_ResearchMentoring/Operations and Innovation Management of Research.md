 Helping mentees develop one's internal compass is my mentoring philosophy. This mentoring statement presents scientist, artist, judge framework and example of how I used this to design architecture of my committee.
## SAJ framework

The SAJ (Scientist, Artist, Judge) framework, ideated by Matt Cronin, characterizes how individuals think and respond to different situations. By placing the researcher, not the research, at the center of the knowledge production process, the SAJ framework helps the mentor  (in a more stable, static frame of reference) understand the functions the mentee (in a dynamic, non-static frame of reference) might need. Due to this difference in perspective, it is critical for the mentor and mentee to align their expectations by drafting a roadmap for their collaboration. Resolution of this map should increase as mentee and mentor continuously integrate milestone and evaluation procedure. Both the process of drawing map and drawn map can help mentees fill in the gap. 

The SAJ framework characterizes three modes of thought:
1. **Scientist**: Focuses on understanding what will happen by identifying the causal relationships in a situation.
2. **Artist**: Imagines what might happen by envisioning new possibilities and alternative scenarios.
3. **Judge**: Evaluates the (dis)utility of what happens, assessing the moral, ethical, and practical implications of various actions.

In research, these modes of thought are essential for producing robust and innovative knowledge. A balanced research process involves understanding the current state of knowledge and predicting outcomes (Scientist), imagining new hypotheses and theoretical frameworks (Artist), and evaluating the relevance, impact, and ethical considerations of research findings (Judge). Research mentoring requires guiding mentees through the SAJ modes to develop a comprehensive understanding of their field, generate innovative ideas, and critically assess their work's implications. This aligns with operations management principles, which optimize resources and processes to achieve desired outcomes. However, setting goals for innovation is challenging as desirability itself is a moving target that needs elicitation. Experimentation is crucial in navigating uncertainty in innovative research, allowing researchers to test hypotheses, gather evidence, and refine their understanding iteratively. This systematic approach enables the identification of key variables, validation of assumptions, and discovery of novel insights. By integrating the SAJ framework with operations and innovation management principles, mentors can create an environment that encourages both systematic investigation and creative exploration, guiding mentees towards impactful research outcomes.

## example
So far, I've used SAJ framework to express my mentoring needs to my advisor and committee members. I had a clear life thesis on global productization of startup operations curriculum. I firmly believe with Charlie Fine, Scott Stern, Vikash Mansinghka mentoring my research as judge, artist, scientist, I could reach my goal. 

To elaborate, I see Scott and Charlie as the artist and judge who can teach me vision and hope. I view Scott and Vikash as the artist and scientist who can help me discover new possibilities. Finally, I consider Charlie and Vikash as the judge and scientist to teach me skills and meaning. By identifying these mentoring pairs and the SAJ modes they represent, I am articulating the specific ways in which each mentor can contribute to my growth.

I hope this journey to my mentoring statement can help me to clearly express the types of mentoring I am seeking from Scott, Charlie and Vikash.
