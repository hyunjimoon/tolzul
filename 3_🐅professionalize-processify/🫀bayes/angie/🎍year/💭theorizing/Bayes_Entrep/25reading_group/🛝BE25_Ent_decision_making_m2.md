## Noise from Inside Out

**model/inference** and **world/measure**

- **action** depends on **inside** noise to **outside** noise ratio
- if **inside** noise becomes higher, **measure** more
- if **outside** noise becomes higher, **move** more

## Apply to Your Decision Making

**Example of "probabilistic AI for equity valuation and allocation"**

**Strategy:**

- customer (founder VS lawyer)
- technology (ADEV VS DSL)
- organization (hire technology expert VS customer expert)
- competition (collaborate VS compete with lawyers)

**Operations:**

- segmentation / evaluation
- processification / automation
- acculturation / evaluation
- capitalization

## Next Steps

1. **Set language**
    
    - subjective → contextual
    - prior distribution = action-oriented encoding of belief
2. **Introduce missing pieces**
    
    - mental model
    - convergence in bayesian inference behavior
    - stochasticity ~ heterogeneity/varieties of Bayes
    - modeling workflow
3. **Apply to your decisions**
    
    - control vs flexibility
    - learning vs earning activities
    - modeling -> allocating -> searching -> programming
