manuel: look like portfolio - correlation?
dim: how to think about - track what demand looks like (fill inventory based on online demand - can be ); investments 
pass gains to sales agent
sandra: two trips of sales agent (can't transfer inventory); giving more inventory - 
when'd you want 

⭐️sun~sat: replenishment is end of sat: tradeoff certainty vs 


midway of time?
i like where your head is heading.

why should we do more thanmon, su
capex of runnig is 10million (15b $) - pay for smarter will payoff

delayed 2-phase distribution works (savings from printing, other savings from freeing printing capacity)

energy provider -  (purchase; pay much more - hoarding)

buy my stuff and sell (option market - )

cheap and can return (broader assortment, )

steph: it knows me, so i'm confident that i'd like that
cristina: speed

## Aug 5
- amazon is compelling to buyers. assortment, data, subscription, delivery, review (prevent analysis paralysis using paradox of choice theory), building on modularized capability such as one click checkout
- selling book, 
- chose bookstore with the vision of collecting data to learn how customers behave online
- high conviction from day 1. founders are obsessed (elon, jeff) - long term plans (no detail is small)
- amazon is terrifying as it's conviction behind long term execution. evolution and development; they had luck that eventually made them successful, 
- major supply chain decision variables
- location of warehouse, raw material suppliers, localization, promise time (standardize process), import location (port - eastern vs western; port of LA), 
- number of vehicles, dispatching, routing, intelligence investment (prediction, prescription)
⭐️may be better to claasify before eliciting answer

distribution is last epoch, close to city as possible

centralized: less inventory, pool risk, economies of 
decentralized: hub spoke (derek thinks solve key delivery time)

- experiment in tail for free

A100-B10-C1000
deliver faster to consumers as they have stores

amazon curate product, selection system, more 
time, omni channel, curate products - walmart can figure out the right thing (cheap way of making)

segmentation

walmart has more money than time

small things aren't gonna move consumer behavior

WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE TEMU - CONFOUNDER OF OUR DISCUSSION

last mile liquidity is expensive

do it faster and you have stores

that's why amazon bought wholefood (2017)

price, assortment, customer experience, speed

partnered with chile

- **Capacity Planning:** How much capacity at each facility
- **Service Coverage:** Geographic reach and service levels
- **Cost Optimization:** Balance of fixed and variable costs

### Trade-off Analysis
1. **Centralization vs. Decentralization**
2. **Cost vs. Service Level**
3. **Inventory vs. Transportation**
4. **Flexibility vs. Efficiency**

### Supply Chain Network Types
- **Direct Shipment:** Manufacturer to customer
- **Hub-and-Spoke:** Central distribution with regional delivery
- **Cross-Docking:** Minimal storage, rapid transfer
- **Multi-Echelon:** Multiple levels of distribution centers

## Amazon's Network Evolution

### Historical Development
1. **Early Stage:** Limited geographic presence
2. **National Expansion:** Cross-country distribution centers
3. **Regional Focus:** Faster delivery through proximity
4. **Local Fulfillment:** Same-day and instant delivery

### Current Network Architecture
- **Fulfillment Centers:** Large automated warehouses
- **Sortation Centers:** Package consolidation and routing
- **Delivery Stations:** Last-mile distribution points
- **Prime Air:** Drone delivery infrastructure (experimental)

### Competitive Advantages

## Discussion Questions for Class

### Question 1: Amazon's European Strategy
**Prompt:** Consider the following three options of designing Amazon's European distribution network:
a. Keep the status quo (three decentralized DCs serving each country independently)
b. Keep the existing DCs but centralize the management of them by possibly allowing a DC in one country to fulfill orders in another
c. Combine all DCs into a single DC serving multiple countries

- Duplicated overhead
- Limited product variety per DC
- Inefficient capacity utilization

#### Option B: Centralized Management
**Pros:**
- Risk pooling benefits
- Better demand allocation
- Economies of scale in purchasing
- Flexibility in fulfillment

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity
- Cross-border shipping costs
- Customs and regulatory issues
- Technology integration challenges

#### Option C: Single European DC
**Pros:**
- Maximum pooling benefits
- Lowest total inventory
