1. Josh's school doesn't distinguish between (belief, prior distribution) or  (desire, utility) but Andrew Gelman's school has higher precision [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/07/15/prior-information-not-prior-belief/),



2. reach out to Kartik to ask for recommendations on the paper after adding six papers to his choice set which I elicited from other phd students of Josh with their curation

inviting Kartik would increase utility of synthetic population representing bayesian entrepreneurship field. Simulation process below.
AngieP.S. after classifyng our group as SFP type,
N vs S: whether one uses simulation-based calibration (S) or not (N)
T vs F: whether one's probability precision for state representation is static (T) vs dynamic (F)
J vs P: whether one's utility is explicit from the start (J) vs allows quasi-utlity (P)

to model our group's entrepreneurial decision making and classified our group as NTP type - 
1. N: we use observing our group dynamics and sense two main changes:1. information span of "our group" is extending
2. unexpected state and action (invitng Kartik) 
3. utility is emerging through unexpected opportunities such as interaction with Josh2. utility
Unfortunately I can't read your mind on the original plan for social planner session so I can't run counterfactual analysis. 
(except scott mentioned society's bad image of contrarians)

I added my reflection of the paper just as a reference in angie(memo).png.Can you help me persuade Kartik by sharing why you were interested in this topic and what might be its application? The documents Scott shared to Josh (two HBS case studies and BE textbook forward) has saved great cost of inference so I thought I'd like ask.
