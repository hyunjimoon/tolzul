Joni mitchell

[1] Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
Looked at clouds that way

[2] But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[3] I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[4] Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[5] But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[6] I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know love
I really don't know love at all

[7] Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, "I love you, " right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[8] Oh, but now old friends, they're acting strange
And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
Well, something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

[9] I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

[10] It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all
