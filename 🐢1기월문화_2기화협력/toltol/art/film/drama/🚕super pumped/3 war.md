Previously, on  
"Super Pumped"...  
  
He's just gonna see  
a guy in his lame jeans  
  
and these fucking shoes.  
  
Yeah, he'll see  
you're a dung-colored man.  
  
Your ideas will matter.  
Not your clothes.  
  
- He'll see that.  
- Grow or die.  
  
- Full access card?  
- You come and go  
  
at Uber cab as you please.  
  
- One of us?  
- Full access.  
  
Nice.  
  
Boom! You just got  
grey-balled, motherfucker!  
  
  
  
Is this illegal?  
  
VCs have a purpose other  
than just writing a check.  
  
I have a purpose.  
  
Advising, vision shaping.  
  
Really? You're not owed  
  
anything except a return,  
which I will give you.  
  
I'm the one who put you in here,  
  
I'm the one  
who can take you out, too.  
  
I say we keep  
Bill close for now.  
  
But you keep  
doing what you're doing.  
  
We're killing it.  
  
- TK, this is...  
- Gabi Holzwarth.  
  
- What did you say to her?  
- I told her she needed to meet  
  
the next Jeff Bezos.  
  
  
  
Hi, what made you choose Lyft  
instead of Uber?  
  
It's so much cheaper,  
  
and the drivers  
are super friendly.  
  
We make more money.  
And we get tips.  
  
These motherfuckers.  
They're stealing all my shit!  
  
Oh, we're going to fucking war.

We had 93% of the market  
on lock.  
  
We invented this shit.  
  
But now, look at heaven.  
  
Look at what it's telling us.  
  
Our first-mover advantage  
is dimming.  
  
And what's taking it?  
  
Lyft.  
  
John fucking Zimmer?  
  
This guy's been drafting on our  
speed the whole Tour de France.  
  
He's always been behind us,  
  
and now he's gonna pretend  
like he's winning?  
  
I'm the one in the yellow  
fucking jersey.  
  
We need to just knock  
these assholes off the road.  
  
Are the drivers  
the assholes or...?  
  
Lyft, fucker. Lyft.  
  
I am being cucked now.  
What are we doing about it?  
  
Well, the drivers  
like the optionality.  
  
We can't stop  
our guys from double-apping  
  
and driving for both.  
  
We should just buy Lyft.  
Absorb them.  
  
We don't have  
the war chest for that.  
  
- Okay, let's get it.  
- Look, who cares  
  
about John Zimmer's  
little rideshare company?  
  
You've got a powerful brand.  
Build it.  
  
Keep your focus on that.  
  
Stop obsessing over Lyft.  
  
You know, Bill,  
I get your point.  
  
But we are in the war room  
right now.  
  
And it seems none  
of you guys want to go to war,  
  
but that's what this is.  
  
And you don't get it done  
with milk and cookies.  
  
You're quoting  
Bobby Knight at me?  
  
- Nice.  
- Look, you are so fucking good,  
  
but this isn't zero-sum  
like a basketball game is.  
  
That's exactly what it is.  
  
Uber right now  
is like Google was  
  
at the dawn of search.  
  
One entrant in a crowded pool.  
What did Google do?  
  
They flattened  
their competitors,  
  
and now they're fucking Google.  
  
Google did it by being better,  
not by being Al Capone.  
  
"Don't be evil" ring a bell?  
  
Yeah. Tell that to AltaVista.  
  
It's funny you say Capone,  
though.  
  
I remember my parents  
never wanted to get us cable  
  
because they thought  
we were just, like,  
  
watching MTV all day  
or something.  
  
But then eventually they caved  
when I was, like, seven.  
  
And the first weekend we had it,  
  
my dad found The Untouchables,  
  
because he thought it was like  
history or something.  
  
Because, you know, it is.  
  
Okay, right, so my...  
  
My dad and Cory and me  
were sitting there  
  
watching this, like,  
history lesson.  
  
I'd have started you  
on The Dirty Dozen,  
  
like my dad did me, but sure.  
  
Okay, but De Niro as Capone.  
  
That banquet scene with the bat.  
  
Capone was just like, walking...  
  
talking, and then bam!  
  
Fucking brains that guy.  
  
That shit changed me.  
  
I felt like my skull  
  
that just got hit with a bat.  
  
I couldn't sleep for, like,  
a week.  
  
I felt horrible for the guy.  
  
I mean,  
he just gets brained at dinner.  
  
But I saw the point.  
  
He had it coming.  
  
Uh, I don't know if he did.  
  
That's not important.  
  
The point is, that shit worked.  
  
You crack a guy's cranium open  
  
between the soup  
and the fish dish?  
  
You know, you make  
an example of somebody,  
  
people start to fall in line.  
  
That is what needs  
to happen here.  
  
Just to clarify,  
  
you want to beat the drivers  
into submission?  
  
I want to win.  
  
And disloyalty,  
  
however it shows its face,  
  
that needs to be punished.  
  
Well, we're not the Mob, though.  
  
Okay, but if you don't want to  
own this whole fucking business,  
  
like it's prohibition and we're  
the only ones making gin,  
  
then why are we here?  
  
You threatened them  
with a baseball bat?  
  
No, not them... exactly.  
  
It was a meta...  
  
What I'm saying is,  
  
sometimes fear works.  
  
Not that it... I don't know.  
  
I don't know what I'm saying.  
  
You make me nervous.  
  
No, I don't,  
but it's a good line.  
  
Every once in a while.  
  
So tell me about the violin.  
  
I guess I didn't know  
  
that I really wanted  
to play at first.  
  
It felt like homework.  
  
And eventually,  
it became my best friend.  
  
Plus, playing, you burn almost  
200 calories an hour.  
  
Is that right?  
  
What else do I need  
to know about you?  
  
Maybe that I'm surprised  
that we're here together.  
  
When we met,  
we spoke so briefly.  
  
I didn't know what you thought.  
  
I was surprised  
when you came and found me  
  
playing at the farmer's market.  
  
No, you weren't.  
  
But it's a good line.  
  
- Every once in a while.  
- Uh-huh.  
  
Here you are.  
  
Thank you.  
  
So, what do you play  
  
to burn off the best meal  
in the Bay Area?  
  
Uh...  
  
"Sibelius," probably.  
  
The concerto in D minor  
if we're having dessert.  
  
Okay, hold on,  
I need the full download  
  
on everything  
I need to listen to  
  
so I can know how great you are.  
  
Thank God for Ek.  
  
Ek?  
  
Yeah. Ek is a founder, like me.  
  
I actually tried to crack  
this space with the company,  
  
but Ek did it.  
  
It's Spotify.  
See, look, you just, uh,  
  
put in everything there  
that I need to listen to.  
  
I can tell you're thinking hard.  
  
It's important.  
  
What are you doing?  
  
I'm just putting in a code  
to give you free Uber.  
  
I prefer Lyft.  
  
Careful.  
  
Come on in.  
  
Sorry, I've, uh,  
sort of been in work mode.  
  
I've seen worse.  
  
I call this place my Jam Pad.  
  
I think I'll kiss you anyway.  
  
Portrait of a man at war.  
  
Yeah, that's great. Nice.  
  
Well, I'm not at war.  
  
I'm sitting in  
a booth somewhere  
  
telling you about this guy  
  
who is, in fact,  
very much at fucking war.  
  
Are we doing it?  
  
We're doing it.  
  
They say good wars,  
winnable ones,  
  
are fought on a single front.  
  
But what if you have to win  
on all the fucking fronts?  
  
New plan. We're gonna step up  
the information technology  
  
on our drivers.  
  
You mean surveillance.  
  
We don't have to use words  
like that.  
  
- Hello.  
- Hey, there.  
  
So, uh, you like driving?  
  
It's a good way to meet people.  
  
Yeah, I bet.  
  
And, uh, San Francisco,  
  
you probably get  
a lot of crazies, huh?  
  
You think we can modify  
having to figure out  
  
who the double-appers are?  
  
Snoop around  
in our drivers' phones,  
  
see if they ever used  
the Lyft app.  
  
Might be doable.  
  
Might cross the line.  
  
Might be a good time to consider  
the business you've chosen.  
  
And what if it's not  
a finite war,  
  
but a forever war?  
  
Well, then you do  
what you have to,  
  
and anyone calls you out  
on the morality,  
  
that motherfucker  
is either a child, an enemy,  
  
or a fucking traitor.  
  
So I see you have both logos  
and both apps.  
  
But you're not more  
of a Lyft guy, are you?  
  
Just asking, because I happen  
to know that Uber  
  
has some very special incentives  
coming online right now.  
  
Okay, okay, hold on.  
  
- Halas.  
- You quit?  
  
I quit Lyft.  
  
The bonuses Uber is offering,  
you have no idea.  
  
We are thrilled to have you  
exclusive to Uber.  
  
- Twenty dollars a mile?  
- Yeah.  
  
And the price for the rider  
stays the same.  
  
We just appreciate your loyalty.  
  
And, uh, tell all your friends,  
okay?  
  
So they are  
just giving away money?  
  
No, no, no, habiti.  
  
They're giving away money to us.  
  
It's very different.  
  
Fucking work-life balance.  
  
If I hear those  
three words again...  
  
- What's up?  
- We can find them now,  
  
the double-appers.  
Pretty soon, anyway.  
  
We won't have to go one by one  
from the field.  
  
We can do it all from here.  
  
And they'll never know  
we're scanning their phones?  
  
Hold on, well,  
if we can get in their phones,  
  
we can turn on the mics  
and the cameras.  
  
We can find out  
who's taking Lyft?  
  
Can.  
  
Not sure I'd want  
to see what happens  
  
in the back of those cars.  
  
- She's the prettier one.  
- Yeah, I know.  
  
Look, I can't help it.  
  
You are insecure  
about this shit.  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
  
No, you look like shit  
in that bikini?  
  
Oh, it's all right  
  
It's all right  
  
Sometimes I wish you were dead.  
  
Great. Fucking wonder...  
You know what?  
  
Sometimes,  
I wish I was dead too.  
  
Oh!  
  
Dude!  
  
Whoa, shake that thing now  
  
- Shake that thing  
- Baby, shake that thing now  
  
Shake that thing  
Baby, shake that thing  
  
Austin sent out street teams to  
request and cancel Lyft rides,  
  
which peels off  
some of the drivers.  
  
Now, this is the same idea,  
just less analog.  
  
Let's go. By the way,  
did she move to the regulators?  
  
Yep.  
  
So now you got your espionage  
  
with a solid helping  
of clandestine attacks.  
  
And then, of course,  
  
you've got your frontal attack.  
  
- Miss Geidt.  
- My team took 20 Lyft rides  
  
over the past 24 hours,  
  
which means we got in the back  
of Class C licensed vehicles,  
  
driven by regular  
old civilians for Lyft.  
  
Well, unless you were  
forced by gunpoint, I don't...  
  
Just wondering when you're gonna  
start enforcing the law.  
  
We are monitoring the situation  
very closely.  
  
Yeah, I can tell.  
  
The thing is, we care too much  
about passenger safety  
  
to let Betty the soccer mom  
turn her Prius into a cab  
  
to pay for her Vicodin habit,  
  
but you've got us  
considering it.  
  
Well, I will certainly alert  
the soccer moms ASAP.  
  
Though I have a feeling...  
  
the drivers aren't  
the middle-aged,  
  
drug-addled dilettantes  
you're conjuring,  
  
but more the working poor  
who are busting their heinies  
  
hustling to fill in the blanks  
  
so that maybe they can get  
a decent meal for their kids.  
  
Not so much to buy  
a few more Norcos.  
  
This goes one of two ways.  
  
You start enforcing the laws  
on Lyft,  
  
or we have justification  
to break those same laws.  
  
And once we start,  
we won't stop like Lestat  
  
after a taste of blood,  
  
or teenage boys with YouPorn.  
  
Do me a favor.  
  
Wait five minutes before  
you call Zimmer to tell him.  
  
So now they know  
you're after them,  
  
and that you have  
your forces mobilizing.  
  
Wars are expensive,  
and this one's no different.  
  
These driver incentives  
are getting very pricey.  
  
- You're still with me on this?  
- In theory, absolutely.  
  
It'd be damn nice  
to take out Lyft.  
  
But in practice,  
we may be financing something  
  
that only ends  
in a bloody stalemate.  
  
We think it's time for a raise  
round to fill the coffers.  
  
- A road show.  
- Oh, no, no.  
  
I need to be at the conn,  
not out begging for capital  
  
- we don't actively need.  
- Show him the list.  
  
We raise enough money  
to actually beat Lyft  
  
instead of pissing away money  
pissing them off.  
  
Kleiner, Excel,  
TPG and Greylock.  
  
This is a little anemic,  
don't you think?  
  
No.  
  
That is spinach  
and prime USDA beef right there.  
  
$350 million on the table  
if you close all those.  
  
What about Google Ventures?  
  
Well, they haven't raised  
their hand yet.  
  
Well, make them  
raise their hand.  
  
That's your special talent  
right? You're Bill Gurley.  
  
Truth is, I don't want them to.  
Not at the moment yet.  
  
I do.  
  
David Drummond and Google  
Ventures rolls in?  
  
Come on, we're minted. That  
sends a message to the valley.  
  
The whole business world.  
That we're special.  
  
That we're not Lyft.  
  
Here's how Google rolls.  
  
They're going to insist  
on being your lead investor  
  
on the first round.  
  
They'll limit their spend  
to $100 million tops.  
  
That's all they'll shoot  
their first hand.  
  
Stops everyone else  
from going beyond that.  
  
They will bigfoot you,  
they will lowball you,  
  
and you'll be screwed.  
  
You ever been to a rodeo?  
  
Went to a pie-eating contest  
once.  
  
I got messy and sick, but I won.  
  
Yeah, well, at a rodeo,  
  
all the young riders,  
  
they always want to climb  
onto the rankest bull  
  
to, you know, prove themselves,  
  
but it's best to get yourself  
seasoned first,  
  
because bull's always  
gonna be there.  
  
But you ride too soon,  
you might not be.  
  
And if I finish the ride  
  
and I win the big shiny  
belt buckle,  
  
then I'm a legend, right?  
  
So I'm not seeing the downside.  
  
Word gets around  
that they turned you down.  
  
It will snuff a lot  
of possibilities, Travis.  
  
TPG, others on that list.  
  
It starts a trend.  
  
And word always gets around.  
  
Pretty good list, TK.  
  
And you know we'll kill it.  
  
All right, fine. Road show.  
  
Let's book it.  
  
All right then.  
  
Open it.  
  
What is this?  
  
Oh, shit.  
  
What... what made you do this...?  
  
You said that  
you're doing a road show,  
  
so you got to look, you know...  
  
Yeah.  
  
So I'm not a dun-colored mare?  
  
It's, uh, Salinger.  
  
Oh, I didn't like  
Catcher in the Rye.  
  
It was overrated to me,  
so I skipped the others.  
  
Worth it?  
  
Uh, yeah.  
  
I mean, I guess.  
  
But thank you so much  
for the shoes.  
  
It's so sweet of you.  
  
You're welcome.  
  
Hey.  
  
Hey. You okay?  
  
Yeah, you know,  
you left these Polaroids  
  
from the Tahoe trip?  
  
Yeah. You can keep them  
if you want.  
  
Okay, well...  
  
also, they're here  
if you want them.  
  
It's a pretty awesome trip.  
  
You called to talk  
about traveling?  
  
We're doing a road show.  
  
Or I said I would do it,  
  
but I think I could  
probably walk it back.  
  
Why would you?  
  
Zimmer's gonna find out  
about it,  
  
and he'll know I need money  
to beat him.  
  
It just feels weak.  
  
You don't like asking for money,  
because it makes you feel needy.  
  
And you don't want to need  
anything from anybody.  
  
But tell yourself this.  
  
Soon enough, you'll never have  
to ask for anything ever again.  
  
And you know when that is.  
  
After this round,  
  
this meeting, this money close.  
  
Yeah, I can't wait for that.  
  
This is your ticket.  
  
And it's not a scratch-off.  
  
You already have the magic  
numbers in your head.  
  
You know what to fill out.  
  
But you need to get  
the guy to hand it to you.  
  
Yeah, exactly.  
  
See? As usual.  
  
Exactly.  
  
How are you?  
  
New place okay?  
  
Yeah, it's great.  
  
Uh, would have loved  
something a little bigger.  
  
Wow, subtle.  
  
What?  
  
I don't know, you're telling me  
to convince people  
  
to put money into Uber,  
  
but then you want me  
to take money out of Uber  
  
and sell some of my shares  
so I can pay you.  
  
Don't. Fucking don't.  
  
I'm just saying... look, you...  
You told me to stay here.  
  
You said you wanted  
to find a new spot.  
  
- You said you would buy me out.  
- I will.  
  
Okay, so stop accusing me  
of being some kind of Valkyrie.  
  
I should go.  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  
  
You're gonna leave it like that?  
  
Do you want  
to consider for a second  
  
you just got into my head  
right now?  
  
You're like Lancaster Dodd  
from the fucking Master.  
  
Travis, you're no Freddie Quell.  
  
You can handle this  
without making yourself  
  
a torpedo juice cocktail.  
  
- Okay, fine.  
- Hey...  
  
you're going to be great  
at this.  
  
I promise.  
  
You can do this.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Here you go, guys.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Here.  
  
Kalanick, right?  
  
Emil Michael.  
  
And you guys are...?  
  
InfoVis.  
  
Never heard of it.  
  
B2B.  
  
Crowd analytics.  
  
Hasn't been a great run for us.  
  
That's really surprising given  
the confidence you're emanating.  
  
You probably walk in,  
and they hand you a check.  
  
Usually.  
  
You didn't do your homework,  
Travis.  
  
- All I do is homework. Come on.  
- Regulators, taxicab commissions  
  
are gonna do all they can  
to shut you down.  
  
There's not gonna be a problem.  
You know I'm a survivor.  
  
At Swoosh you almost  
did not survive, man.  
  
- That was ahead of its time.  
- I looked at your projections.  
  
You have to spend at least five  
times more marketing  
  
just to have anybody  
know who you are.  
  
I'm gonna raise all that.  
That's gonna be fun.  
  
Yeah, you know how much  
fucking money  
  
you're going to have to raise?  
You know my rule.  
  
We went through this in  
Red Swoosh over and over again.  
  
I am not going to invest in a  
company where you have to raise  
  
hundreds of millions of dollars  
  
to do tens of millions  
of dollars in revenues.  
  
Bro, we are going to be making  
billions of dollars.  
  
This idea is much bigger  
than Red Swoosh.  
  
- You know that.  
- Billions in revenues, maybe.  
  
But you're going to have  
to spend billions of dollars  
  
to get there,  
and I'll get diluted to nothing.  
  
I don't... what's the point  
of making an investment  
  
in a company where I put in  
a lot of money,  
  
and I end up with zip?  
  
If you pass on this right now,  
  
I'm never coming back to you.  
  
Guess what, Travis. I just did.  
  
Hello, InfoVis.  
  
We are ready to go.  
Please follow me.  
  
I told you we came too early.  
  
Yeah, I don't want to rush  
and get sweaty.  
  
Some of these places  
got leather seats,  
  
and the leather and the sweat...  
not a fun combo.  
  
Oh, shit! Sorry.  
  
Travis?  
  
- Zimmer.  
- Yeah.  
  
Uh, I know.  
  
But we loved  
your campaign that much.  
  
Figure we can't ignore  
we're in a dogfight,  
  
might as well lean in.  
  
And the VCs  
seem to get it so far.  
  
Yeah, my, uh...  
  
My shirt's our closer.  
  
Though I guess technically,  
it's your shirt.  
  
So thank you.  
  
Hey, good luck in there.  
  
He's taller than I thought.  
  
I just need to get in your Wi-Fi  
and I'll be set.  
  
Travis, Emil, the team and I  
are excited you came in.  
  
Yeah, no, I don't think so.  
  
You guys just had  
a company in here  
  
I don't even want to be  
in the same room with.  
  
I mean, I get it, right?  
  
Companies have to donate  
to Republicans and to Democrats  
  
so you're greased in  
with whoever wins, but you...  
  
you're VCs.  
  
You're supposed to believe in  
the company you put money into,  
  
not just protect yourself  
in the possibility  
  
you made the wrong call.  
  
So your pitch is we go with you  
or Lyft, but not both?  
  
I'm gonna make it easy for you.  
We're done here.  
  
Thanks for the water.  
  
Cancel the meetings.  
  
- Which?  
- All of them.  
  
That's fucking genius.  
  
That's fucking insane.  
You canceled the road show?  
  
- You don't want to do the raise?  
- No, no, no. We're doing it.  
  
Bill, look, it's like,  
you ever been to a club?  
  
You know, the velvet rope that  
makes everyone want to get in?  
  
So I am a club called Unicorn,  
and if investors want in,  
  
they got to get in line.  
  
Maybe that stunt  
  
that you pulled  
at the VC firm works.  
  
Maybe they want in so bad  
they make an offer.  
  
They block out Lyft.  
  
Even so, we still have  
to raise the rest.  
  
We're gonna raise the rest,  
dude.  
  
We're just gonna do it here.  
  
We're flipping the paradigm.  
  
It's not a road show.  
  
Home show. Home show!  
  
Home show! Come on!  
  
Right?  
You're with the insurgents now.  
  
This shouldn't be  
fucking with your head.  
  
No, I'm just trying  
to figure out  
  
how it is that starving  
your own company  
  
is insurgency  
and not just a temper tantrum.  
  
- Worked for Gandhi.  
- Yeah, well,  
  
when Gandhi made that choice,  
  
he was the one  
doing the starving.  
  
Not his investors.

I've tried every fucking thing.  
  
I can't get this class C  
bullshit shut down.  
  
Yeah, and Zimmer knows it,  
and he's using it.  
  
Every meeting now  
someone's asking me,  
  
what does Uber have to do  
to get bigger?  
  
Do you have an answer?  
  
It occurs to me  
I think we got polite.  
  
We're just using registered  
livery drivers, why?  
  
Because it's a fucking rule?  
  
I mean while Lyft  
is undercutting us  
  
like they're Costco of livery.  
  
We're disruptors.  
  
We can't be afraid  
to disrupt even ourselves.  
  
We open up the business.  
  
Let in civilians,  
  
anybody with a driver's license  
can come join the team.  
  
We will crush Lyft  
at their own game.  
  
Luxury in an app.  
That was the vision always.  
  
And it's a great vision.  
  
Uber is a black car company.  
  
No one wants to ride around  
in someone's used Camry.  
  
Are you so sure about that?  
  
This is the last time  
this ever happens.  
  
Police walked in  
For Jimmy Jazz  
  
I said "He ain't here  
But he sure went by"  
  
Oh, you're looking for  
  
Jimmy Jazz  
  
Yeah, they said  
  
Satta Massagana  
For Jimmy Dread  
  
Cut off his ears  
And chop off his head  
  
Police come look for  
  
Jimmy Jazz  
  
Jazz, Jazz, Jazz  
  
So go look  
  
Wow! Thanks so much, guys.  
  
Have a fantastic night.  
  
Chatty fella.  
  
That's the Lyft UX in action.  
  
You know, you sit up front,  
you make a friend.  
  
Yeah, I'm not that lonely yet.  
  
I'm not saying  
that it couldn't happen,  
  
but there's nothing cool  
about that experience.  
  
Maybe that's not the point.  
  
Are we selling cool,  
or selling transportation?  
  
We're selling cool transpo.  
  
Elegant. James fucking Bond.  
  
That's the brand.  
Always has been.  
  
TK, it's your call.  
  
I mean, it's your call.  
  
Both.  
  
You go into a department store,  
  
they have that shitty jewelry  
on the counter, right?  
  
But the good stuff  
is in the glass boxes.  
  
- Two levels of service.  
- Exactly, all right.  
  
So you want luxury, you want  
cool, you can pay for cool.  
  
But we slide another option  
into the app.  
  
Charge 35% less  
and call it UberX,  
  
so it still feels cool.  
  
It's always X with you.  
  
Yeah, the X is for "extra sexy."  
  
You would laugh at that.  
  
Dude, you brought me in to grind  
on these kinds of calls.  
  
Yeah. That's true.  
  
But I'm still gonna  
give you my opinion,  
  
and I expect you  
to take it seriously.  
  
And then I'll ride with you  
on it.  
  
No matter what you decide.  
  
It's your company, man.  
  
For Garrett?  
  
You know,  
I'm hearing Google Ventures  
  
is in the mix this round.  
  
That's weird.  
  
I can't control the rumor mill,  
Bill, can I?  
  
That's me.  
  
Once we added the UberX  
functionality, boom,  
  
that is driver supply,  
that is rider demand.  
  
What part of  
"do not disturb" do...?  
  
David motherfucking Drummond.  
  
In theory, a top Google lawyer.  
  
In practice, Larry and Sergey's  
business brain.  
  
Head of their investment arm,  
Google Ventures.  
  
Loved and feared in every  
boardroom in Silicon Valley.  
  
A real OG.  
  
And a BFD.  
  
And the one-man TK  
set this entire trap for.  
  
Hi. Travis Kalanick.  
  
No shit. I'm in your office.  
  
Sit down.  
  
I don't imagine  
you made the drive  
  
all the way from Mountain View  
to hear me talk,  
  
so why don't you start?  
  
I'm wondering  
who you think you are  
  
telling everyone in my valley  
we're in your round.  
  
Aren't you?  
  
Because again,  
long drive, David.  
  
Or is it Mr. Drummond?  
  
I'm more of a TK to my friends,  
Travis to my enemies,  
  
and a fucking lottery ticket to  
anybody who knows what's what.  
  
Breakfast, Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.,  
Charlie's Café on the campus.  
  
This is a home show,  
not a road show.  
  
You know what?  
I can make an exception.  
  
That's cool.  
  
But...  
  
I want Larry Page there.  
  
That's a tough get.  
  
I'll see what I can do.  
  
Um, hi.  
  
David fucking Drummond  
came into the office today,  
  
and we are going  
to the Googleplex on Tuesday.  
  
And Larry Page  
is gonna be there!  
  
I feel fucking amazing!  
  
I can see that.  
  
You are my good-luck charm.  
  
Okay. Well, I like that.  
  
Is he coming?  
  
Larry Page, Travis Kalanick,  
  
and Emil Michael.  
  
It's so great to meet you, man.  
  
So, look, I'll admit  
when I started Uber,  
  
it was just a way  
for me and my buddies  
  
to get around San Francisco  
in limos like ballers.  
  
You know, we didn't have  
a grand plan.  
  
For a minute.  
  
But then I was forced  
to learn to improvise  
  
once it turned out  
everybody wanted in.  
  
Has that ever happened to you?  
You know, you have an idea  
  
and then it spins  
into something else?  
  
Maybe not.  
  
Maybe you just see it all  
in front of you  
  
perfectly mapped out,  
  
exactly the way  
it'll come to pass.  
  
I don't know, me? I have to stay  
open to opportunity  
  
and nimble enough to change,  
  
because here's the thing:  
We are not a limo company.  
  
We're a technology company.  
  
But if I had known that  
at the start,  
  
I might have never started.  
  
You know, my mom, she says,  
"Look before you leap."  
  
But I'm always like, how am I  
going to get a good enough view  
  
and decide what's next  
  
if I'm not already up  
in the air, you know?  
  
Because I took the leap, right?  
  
Like you guys with Google Maps,  
that is a leap.  
  
But you're up in the air,  
and you can look, and boom.  
  
Autonomous vehicles, right?  
  
Yeah, you know,  
self-driving cars  
  
are very much front of mind.  
  
Still early stages, but...  
  
Yeah.  
  
Ooh, you make me live  
  
Whatever this world  
Can give to me  
  
It's you  
  
You're all I see  
  
Ooh, you make me live now  
Honey  
  
Ooh, you make me live  
  
Oh, you're the best friend  
  
That I ever had  
  
I've been with you  
Such a long time...  
  
Look, it'd be easy  
for Google Ventures  
  
to just plug some money  
into Uber  
  
and walk away and siphon off  
some of our success.  
  
But I don't think  
that's what you want to do.  
  
I think you want us  
to grow together, right?  
  
Like, imagine we could  
share data  
  
from all the millions of trips  
  
that Uber runs every day.  
  
Plug that into Google Maps  
  
or anything else  
that we want to team up on.  
  
Flying cars.  
  
The numbers.  
  
You aware?  
  
Flying cars?  
  
Move 14% of vehicles currently  
on the road to air lanes,  
  
traffic congestion  
goes down 82%.  
  
Wow.  
  
That...  
  
Your idea?  
  
Uber?  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
Yeah, it was.  
  
My partner, Garrett,  
he ideated the concept,  
  
but I refined it  
and really built it.  
  
Interesting.  
  
How does route planning work?  
  
That's not easy.  
  
That's... is that OSRM,  
or are you using our APIs?  
  
It's open-source.  
  
Open-source what?  
  
OpenStreetMap, I'm pretty sure.  
  
It's... it's really advanced.  
We have the best guys on it.  
  
If you say so.  
  
You don't actually write code,  
do you, Tyler?  
  
Travis.  
  
Kalanick.  
  
Okay.  
  
Good.  
  
Yeah, we should, you know...  
  
You know...  
  
Let's do this.  
  
If we come on,  
I'll get a board seat.  
  
- An observer's seat.  
- A voting seat.  
  
That's a deal-breaker.  
  
The only way I'm giving up  
  
a voting seat is if there's  
a spend commensurate  
  
- with the people at this table.  
- It's my table.  
  
If Uber weren't the hottest  
entrant in transportation space,  
  
I wouldn't be sitting here,  
and neither would you.  
  
Look...  
  
Amazon is a warehouse company.  
  
We are the everything company.  
  
You revolutionize  
transportation,  
  
you revolutionize  
urban development,  
  
real estate, the energy sector,  
  
food and hospitality,  
trading and shipping.  
  
I mean, this is a lot more  
than just how people shop.  
  
This is how they live,  
and it's all frictionless,  
  
because that's who we are.  
  
Our brand changes the world,  
just like your does.  
  
You got an ask?  
  
Quarter-bil.  
  
The most Google's ever invested  
is a hundred million.  
  
I'm willing to talk something  
in that ballpark...  
  
Talk about  
a quarter-billion dollars.  
  
That's the ask.  
  
- Can you believe that?  
- That was fucking insane.  
  
Dude, the vibe between  
me and Larry was tight.  
  
I'm calling Bill.  
  
Hmm? No, no, no.  
Don't... don't do that.  
  
Okay, maybe I don't?  
  
I'm running this play without  
protection in the pocket.  
  
Fuck.  
  
You went in there  
without even telling Bill  
  
and without telling me what  
the actual ask was gonna be?  
  
Are you actually in the pocket?  
  
I'm fine.  
  
He's gonna find out.  
  
He's not my dad.  
  
And if we nail a quarter-bil,  
then he can apologize.  
  
If we don't, then he can gloat.  
  
You don't actually  
have the Google cash.  
  
We might never have it.  
  
You might have completely  
blown it with that ask.  
  
I cannot believe  
you're not with me on this one.  
  
Dude, the money is coming in  
one way or another.  
  
Look at our growth rate.  
  
- Look at our burn rate.  
- That's true.  
  
- The incentives are killing us.  
- But that's why we buy Lyft,  
  
so we can stop paying these  
fucking incentives to the  
  
drivers, because where else  
are they gonna go?  
  
Maybe we should  
run this by Bill...  
  
No, we're not. Don't say "Bill."  
We're not running by anything.  
  
No run-bys.  
We endgame Lyft, okay?  
  
We get the Google money,  
and we end them.  
  
That's it.  
  
Unless you want them nipping  
at our heels forever.  
  
Should I have called?  
  
Give me the room.  
  
I love saying that.  
  
David Drummond called.  
  
Called you?  
  
I'm the guy they call.  
  
That's how this works.  
  
When you fuck up, they call me.  
  
When you try to go deep  
with Larry Page, they call me.  
  
When you land over  
a quarter of a billion dollars  
  
of Google's money, they call me.  
  
Fuck you.  
  
No, thanks. I'm good.  
  
My founder just raised  
some serious cash.  
  
Oh!  
  
- You feeling it?  
- Holy shit!  
  
Yes. Holy shit.  
  
I know how to win now.  
I know how.  
  
I already set up  
the dinner with Zimmer.  
  
Now you can do it.  
  
Okay, then.  
  
We're gonna go in there,  
we're gonna scoop up Lyft.  
  
Zimmer is gonna...  
He's gonna act weird at first.  
  
He's bleeding.  
His board's after him.  
  
He knows he's dying,  
and he doesn't want to die.  
  
So you're gonna let him know  
  
that you're not going to go to  
the press and call him a loser.  
  
And you're gonna treat  
his employees with respect...  
  
and a seat on the board.  
  
- Okay, I can do that.  
- Oh, I know you can,  
  
because a guy marries a woman  
with kids,  
  
he has to prove he's not gonna  
fuck up her life or theirs.  
  
You get it?  
  
I got it.  
  
Did you say  
over a quarter-billion?  
  
Two-fifty-seven.  
  
I guess it's okay if they  
bigfoot us now, right, Bill?  
  
It's very fucking okay.  
They bought the right.  
  
The legend's always been  
  
the restaurants in Little India  
all share the same kitchen.  
  
So you walk down Sixth Street  
in New York City,  
  
and every storefront  
has a different name.  
  
They have a different collection  
of Christmas lights  
  
and different aging menus  
taped to the windows,  
  
but it's all a mirage.  
  
You mean like an actual mirage,  
or people just can't believe  
  
that all these different  
Indian restaurants  
  
share the same kitchen?  
  
Never did find out.  
  
The vindaloo,  
  
it doesn't taste the same  
at all those places.  
  
I just... I call bullshit.  
  
Yeah, me too. Probably, right?  
  
But maybe  
that's the magic of it.  
  
Create the sense of choice  
  
that the customer is engaging  
in a decision.  
  
But actually all the money's  
flowing back to the same place.  
  
And in this case, that'd be us.  
  
Something like that.  
  
We think you retaining 17%  
of the company is a fair deal.  
  
We wanted 25.  
  
We know, Kate.  
  
I can sit with 17.  
  
Board seat as discussed.  
  
Lyft retains its app and staff,  
  
and we can discuss  
lightening our C-suite.  
  
We have a few top performers  
we'd like to protect.  
  
Eight percent.  
  
You know what I wanted to say?  
  
Here's my final offer: nothing.  
  
Like the Lake Tahoe scene.  
  
I just didn't want you guys  
to think I was screwing around.  
  
- Travis.  
- So you're serious?  
  
I mean, I also sprung  
for the Sam Wo's.  
  
You know, Travis,  
sometimes when you put your dick  
  
out on a table,  
  
it doesn't necessarily mean  
you have a big one.  
  
It might just mean  
you exposed yourself.  
  
You have no fucking idea  
how many people assume  
  
that everything  
I've accomplished  
  
is somehow to compensate  
for everything I'm not.  
  
But you have to know  
  
the whole worth of your company  
is predicated on my success.  
  
You're a tapeworm.  
  
I'm the host. You need me.  
  
What, to be on that wall?  
I need you on that wall?  
  
You need me to survive.  
  
I understand you feel that way.  
  
This isn't about feelings, man.  
This is about facts.  
  
You're shedding six and a half  
percent a day  
  
of potential revenue  
to us post-UberX.  
  
We're gonna roll out  
dynamic pricing.  
  
That number's going to double.  
  
You're going to lose all your  
drivers.  
  
More than that, you're going to  
lose your customers.  
  
Because they like  
your little interface.  
  
But you know  
what they like more?  
  
A car that shows up fast,  
  
and you won't be able  
to provide it.  
  
He's not putting it  
very diplomatically.  
  
His terms are not the ones  
I recommended.  
  
But it is true.  
  
Something funny?  
  
You could have walked  
out of here tonight  
  
owning the entire  
rideshare space.  
  
Like Coke and Pepsi got hitched.  
  
But you're not smart enough.  
  
No, no, that's not it.  
  
You're not sophisticated enough.  
You're not cultured enough.  
  
Fuck, you're not human enough.  
  
Sure, you have some savvy.  
  
And, yes, you are good  
with numbers.  
  
But you're too much  
of a goddamn predatory animal  
  
to take a sure thing  
when it comes to you.  
  
I don't know why.  
  
I... I don't actually care.  
  
Here's what's gonna happen.  
  
I'm not ever leaving  
the rideshare space.  
  
Not now.  
  
I mean, I was ready  
to pull back.  
  
But after this, uh-uh.  
  
I will grow, and I will suck  
  
the ever-loving fucking life  
out of your company.  
  
And I will outlast you.  
  
And when I do,  
when I go public first,  
  
I just want you to remember,  
  
you brought this shit-ton  
of bricks down on your own head.  
  
Bill, thanks much.  
  
Well, that was fucking  
ridiculous.  
  
I had to take a walk.  
  
I'm sorry you wasted  
your evening.  
  
It's fine.  
  
I know it's not.  
  
What are you doing, Bill?  
  
Riding shotgun  
with a guy like that?  
  
I saw your face. You had no idea  
  
he was gonna self-immolate  
in there tonight.  
  
I'm sorry we couldn't  
throw you a lifeline,  
  
but his point's not wrong.  
  
Probably all healthier  
if we compete.  
  
Sure.  
  
You got to defend your founder.  
  
Gurley stands behind his man.  
  
But every time  
Travis gets a win...  
  
you're making him believe  
  
the world owes him that win.  
  
First loss he has,  
he's gonna think he's drowning,  
  
and he's gonna stand on  
your shoulders to save himself.  
  
He'll push you right under.  
  
John.  
  
Let me know if I can help you  
this funding round.  
  
Just, uh, make some quiet calls.  
  
I used to consider you  
one of the good ones.  
  
Now I see you've turned  
into a jackal like all the rest.  
  
I don't want you  
anywhere near my company.  
  
"Google Ventures  
is the largest investor,  
  
"with $257.79 million in.  
  
"This round values Uber at  
around $3.4 billion pre-money,  
  
$3.76 billion post-money."  
  
This is absolutely  
fucking great.  
  
Well, I'm happy to be here.  
  
You going down  
to say hello to David?  
  
Yeah, I'm walking now.  
  
Uh, hey, listen,  
I was just curious.  
  
When was it that, uh, you guys  
decided to tank the Lyft deal  
  
and try to kill them  
instead of buying them?  
  
There wasn't a specific  
internal discussion.  
  
Well, I mean, did you, uh...?  
  
Did you lose my phone number  
for a while,  
  
or you forget how to dial?  
  
We had a relationship  
when you put me in, for sure.  
  
And we still have one now.  
  
It's different, though.  
It has to be.  
  
Now, I know that.  
You know that.  
  
Why don't we just enjoy  
his success, Bill?  
  
It's all to our benefit.  
  
Alright, take care of your mom.  
  
What time is your flight?  
  
Tomorrow morning at 8:00.  
  
Hmm.  
  
You finally left Rex alone  
to shoot around out there, huh?  
  
I was just trying to impart  
something about the game  
  
to our guy  
before I leave tomorrow.  
  
Not just about the game.  
  
I tell you what,  
I hope he listens to his coaches  
  
better than he does to me,  
  
because he tunes me out  
like an old radio dial.  
  
Because you play D1,  
which he has to ignore,  
  
or it'll be too hard  
to keep going.  
  
You always say a good coach  
finds a way to cut through.  
  
Either gets loud or quiet,  
  
or finds an angle  
until he's heard.  
  
I'm kind of sucking  
at that lately.  
  
Say the rest.  
  
The thing you don't want to.  
  
Uber scored huge  
in this last round.  
  
Massive.  
  
And you're mad? Why?  
  
Sounds like you did good.  
  
Because his wins are his,  
  
and his losses, his sins,  
are all of ours.  
  
And he won't listen.  
  
Ah, you know,  
I can't protect him.  
  
I...  
  
I stood up for him.  
  
A smart guy,  
a guy I greatly respect.  
  
He looked me right in the eye,  
right in the soul,  
  
and he told me  
exactly what he saw.  
  
There's nothing.  
  
Well, if Travis won't let you  
protect him,  
  
then that's on him, not you.  
  
Or is this about the money?  
  
No.  
  
A little.  
  
A lot.  
  
At the end of this run,  
it's the one that...  
  
It's the one that pays  
for all the others.  
  
It's the one that makes it  
so we nev...  
  
Ever have to think  
about money again.  
  
Oh, I don't think  
about it much now.  
  
And I rarely heard you talk  
about it until this...  
  
This idea of changing  
the family tree seemed possible.  
  
Meaning I'm fine  
just the way we are.  
  
But what if you got the money  
out of your head  
  
and made the right decision?  
  
For the guy? For the team?  
  
For everyone  
who deals with them?  
  
Because if you don't,  
  
I don't want to see you  
carrying that around.  
  
Hey, Bill, they should have  
water out there for us.  
  
But you want  
anything else to drink?  
  
- You want a soda or something?  
- Water sounds just fine.  
  
- Thanks, Mike.  
- How about any, uh,  
  
specific questions  
you want me to ask you?  
  
I think whatever you throw out  
at me will be fine, yeah.  
  
TK, Gurley's panel's up.  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
Think I mentioned the raise.  
  
All right, it's about that time.  
Are you ready?  
  
- Yeah.  
- All right, let's do it.  
  
You know, uh,  
come to think of it, uh, Mike...  
  
yeah, there is.  
  
Bill, I got one  
last question for you.  
  
Do you think we're in  
a tech bubble?  
  
I think that we're in  
a risk bubble.  
  
Uh, especially with these, uh...  
  
these so-called unicorns.  
  
Except for your one  
true unicorn, right, Bill?  
  
We've flushed an excessive  
amount of money onto them,  
  
and they, uh...  
  
Well, a lot of them,  
including some favorites of mine  
  
are, uh, acting, uh...  
  
irrationally.  
  
Warren Buffett has a...  
  
Has a great saying.  
  
"Be fearful  
when others are greedy,  
  
and be greedy  
when others are fearful."  
  
I'm not here to accuse anyone  
of being greedy.  
  
But there is nowhere near  
enough fear  
  
in Silicon Valley right now.  
  
And I think you will see  
some dead unicorns this year.  
  
There you have it,  
ladies and gentlemen.  
  
Bill Gurley.  
  
What the fuck was that?  
  
"Dead unicorns." What, is he  
sending a coded fucking message?  
  
Okay, we just raised  
a crazy successful round.  
  
We basically destroyed  
our nearest rival,  
  
and that's his fucking response?  
  
I guess it was.  
  
All right, he wants to play  
with fucking baseball bats.  
  
Let's play with bats.  
  
Penny, I need a sit-down  
with Bill Gurley  
  
as soon as he is fucking back.
