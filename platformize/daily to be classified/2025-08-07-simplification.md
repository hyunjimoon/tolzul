# 2025-08-07 Simplification to Four Chains

```
        🐢 Can?                👾 User?
   Simple four-chain       Knowledge workers
   system that forces      need clear mental
   daily recitation        models for filing

               \                /
         Deliver? ←→  Sell?

        🐅 Goal?              🐙 Offer?  
    Transform tolzul      Four chains as
    into living system    THE organizing
    of four chains        principle
```

**Deliver**: 🐅×🐢 = ✓ Four folders force chain thinking
**Sell**: 👾×🐙 = ✓ Simple system anyone can follow
**$/time**: ✓ Less folders = faster filing = more recitation

**Learning**: Radical simplification - from dozens of folders to just FOUR chains. Every piece of knowledge must answer: "Which chain does this advance?" This constraint forces clarity and progression thinking.

## The Four Chains (Final Form)
1. 🐢 **Acculturate → Evaluate** (Culture/Theory/Experiments)
2. 🐅 **Evaluate → Professionalize → Processify → Automate** (Methods/Education)
3. 🐙 **Collaborate → Automate → Platformize → Capitalize** (Projects/Execution)
4. 👾 **Segment → Replicate → Capitalize** (Users/Markets/Scale)

## Key Insight
By reducing to ONLY four folders, we make the chains impossible to ignore. Every file operation becomes a meditation on progression from idea to scale.
