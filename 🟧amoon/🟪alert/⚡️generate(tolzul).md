1. 🌳Nail (Term Sheet Advisor): Angie will focus on developing a probabilistic program to analyze and advise on term sheets for early-stage startups. This involves modeling the complex negotiations and decision-making processes between founders and investors, considering factors like valuation, equity distribution, and investment terms. The goal is to create an AI tool that can help entrepreneurs make more informed decisions during the crucial funding stages of their ventures.

2. ⛰️Scale (Tesla's Cybertruck): For the scaling stage, Angie will examine Tesla's launch of the Cybertruck as a new market segment. This case study will explore how an established company like Tesla manages the transition from niche electric vehicles to a broader market with a radically different product. The focus will be on applying probabilistic programming techniques to model market segmentation, production scaling, and resource allocation challenges faced during this expansion phase.

3. 🌊Sail (Changi Airport): The sailing stage will involve analyzing Changi Airport's operations, particularly their efforts to improve on-time performance while handling increased flight volumes. This includes modeling complex systems like flight scheduling, resource allocation (e.g., gates, ground crew), and the integration of new technologies like autonomous baggage handling. The goal is to use probabilistic programming to optimize airport operations and innovate processes in a mature, "sailing" organization.

As diagramed in the next page, my research requires mastery of nine interconnected modules (M): 1. Differentiable programming using  , 2.1 Program synthesis for automated data modeling, 2.2 Bayesian decision and game theory for strategic planning, 3.1 Investment structuring for entrepreneurial capitalization, 3.2 Resource/computation rationality, 3.3 Decision partnering task and world modeling, 4.1 Program language design for domain knowledge representation, 4.2 Metrics design for measuring innovation, 5. Meaningful innovation measures. As such, I’m petitioning for four classes for my research area “Operations and innovation management”. Each class contributes to nine modules as follows:

Core1. Integer Optimization (15.083) helps M3.3. It uses typical operational contexts (transportation, scheduling, supply chain) to provide toolbox for solving complex decision problems. Isomorphism between graph-polyhedron-matrix representation types, duality between decision variable and constraint, variable management given finite computational memory, algorithms to reformulate or decompose complex problems into manageable subproblems such as column/row generation, branch and bound/price are most relevant. However, the class didn’t use M1, which I think is a great opportunity.
 
Core2. Microeconomic Theory (API-111) contributes to M 2.2, 3.2, 3.3. I learned how replacing objective risk with subjective belief lowers clockspeed ratio of action to state (look before you leap), how different perspectives can exist between econometrician (when will it be as if demands were generated by representative consumer maximizing utility), positive theorist (when will behavior from demands satisfy WARP), welfare theorist (in what sense is well-being of representative consumer a measure of society's well-being), how Pareto optimal-competitive equilibrium-social welfare maximization are isomorphic in some sense. Instructor (Luis Armona)’s appreciation for computational bayesian approach was motivating.

Core3. Economics of Ideas, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship (15.357) strengthens M 3.1, 4.2, 5. Revolving around idea production function, it showcases how flow of idea is a function of stock of idea with additional input as labor, capital, institution, and policy. It introduces design of innovation quality measure using predictive analytics along with innovation ecosystem stakeholder (government, university, corporate, risk capital, startup)’s interactions. By exploring both theoretical and empirical approaches to innovation economics, one can develop more comprehensive and context-sensitive innovation measures (M5).

The computation elective, Computational Cognitive Science (9.66), will equip me with M 2.1, 2.2, 4.1 and strengthen M3.2, 3.3. I’ll learn probabilistic programming and language models which can represent complex knowledge structures efficiently. The course's focus on Bayesian inference, hierarchical model, sampling algorithm, decision making aligns with my interest. With these tools, I intend to represent operations and innovation management domain knowledge to solve in a robust and efficient way.
