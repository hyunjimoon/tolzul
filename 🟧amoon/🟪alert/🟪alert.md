# 🟪 Alert - Identify Anomalies and Tensions

## 💭 THEORIZING Mode

**Primary Function**: Expand perspective by imagining possibilities that are not yet perceived

**Process and product achieve consistency here.** In this outer orbital domain, I develop theoretical frameworks that connect Bayesian inference with evolutionary principles through probabilistic programming.

### Key Activities
- Question foundations and current assumptions
- Birth new frameworks for understanding
- Flip perspectives to reveal hidden opportunities
- Identify gaps between what is and what could be

### Core Approaches

#### **Bayesian Calibration**
Developing mathematical models that accurately represent uncertainty through prior knowledge and observed data

#### **Evolutionary Entrepreneurship** 
Studying how entrepreneurial approaches adapt and evolve in complex systems ([[📝🧭Vectorizing Adaptation]])

#### **Probabilistic Programming**
Creating computational frameworks that express probabilistic models as programs

### Key Projects

- **MIT Bayesian Entrepreneurship Research Lab**: Founded interdisciplinary research initiative connecting statistical theory with entrepreneurial practice
- **Bayesian Data Analysis Translation**: Made foundational statistical concepts accessible to non-specialists through translation work
- **A2S Ratio Development**: Pioneering metric for evaluating the balance between algorithmic and statistical components in decision systems

### Publications

- "Simulation-Based Calibration Checking for Bayesian Computation"

### Entrepreneurial Style
**Pioneer (NFP)**: Innovative exploration with breakthrough potential but unpredictable results

### Core Questions
- **How does new theory improve on old approaches?**
- **What scholarly gap is being addressed?**
- **What anomalies in current thinking need attention?**

### Characteristics
- The mind races ahead of evidence
- Untethered by known constraints
- Glimpses possibilities invisible to others
- Breaks convention to reveal new landscapes

### Method
- **Device of Imaginary Results**: Reason using imagined experimental outcomes
- Infer/calibrate initial probabilities by simulating posterior probabilities
- Generate multiple hypotheses before verification

### ADGC Framework Integration

#### A0: Core Anomaly Template
**🟪: The core tension that existing theory can't explain**

#### A1, A2: Component Surprises
**🟪1, 🟪2: The component surprises that create the tension**

#### A12: Amplified Anomaly
**🟪12: How the components interact to amplify the anomaly**

### Academic Paper Integration
- **Paper Sections**: Introduction, Literature Review
- **Key Components**: Problem statement and significance, Current research gap identification, New vs. old theoretical comparison, Need-solution framing
- **Core Questions**: 
  - **How does new theory improve on old approaches?**
  - **What scholarly gap is being addressed?**

### TPE Framework Answer
The new theory incorporates resource rationality explicitly, balancing Type I and II errors, and acknowledges subjective entrepreneurial beliefs and constraints, improving explanatory and predictive accuracy compared to traditional models that assume either irrational optimism or complete rationality without constraints.

### Connection to ADGC Framework
This stage corresponds to the **💭 THEORIZING** phase in the TPE framework, where imagination proposes new possibilities that haven't yet been tested against reality.

### Linkages
- 🧱: [[🏭def(generate)]], [[⚡️generate(tolzul)]]
- The theoretical domain exists not in isolation but as the foundation for both [[📐produce(💭)]] and [[💸Evaluate()]] domains
- As the outermost orbit, it moves deliberately, creating space for deep thinking and rigorous foundation-building
