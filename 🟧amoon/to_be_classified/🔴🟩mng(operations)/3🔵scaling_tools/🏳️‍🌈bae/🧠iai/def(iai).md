	- how to map "ideation to growth" strategy: desirability (phase1), feasibility (tech. (context-free), operational (complentary assests (infra), context)), viability (efficiency) signal
	- topic modeling
- definition of innovation would differ according to how we think about its measurement
- could sythentizing ~ growth state?
- 1. you don't need to be entrep. to commercialize your idea 
- 2. easier to become entrep. (lower risk)
