Relational reasoning involves maintaining and updating coherent beliefs about structured domains, like family trees, based on relational information. 
# Relational Reasoning in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

## Definition and Key Concepts

Relational reasoning involves understanding and reasoning about the relationships between different entities, concepts, or variables. In entrepreneurial contexts, it focuses on understanding hierarchical relationships between decisions and how choices in one domain affect options in others.

Key components include:

- **Hierarchical Modeling**: Understanding how decisions at different levels relate to each other
- **Interdependence Analysis**: Recognizing connections between seemingly separate aspects of a business
- **Causal Relationships**: Identifying how changes in one variable affect others
- **Structure Discovery**: Finding meaningful patterns and relationships in complex data

## Examples from Angie Moon's Presentation

### Hierarchical Bayesian Models

Angie introduces hierarchical Bayesian modeling as a key concept absent in entrepreneurial decision-making literature. She illustrates how hierarchical models can represent abstraction in entrepreneurial thinking:

"Hierarchical Bayesian is, as far as I know, absent in entrepreneur decision making literature as of now. But I think it's important in that it shows some abstraction of the world."

She presents a three-level hierarchical model showing:

1. **Data level**: Raw observations and metrics
2. **Structures level**: How data points relate to each other
3. **Forms level**: Higher-order patterns that generate the structures
4. **Grammar level**: Rules and systems that determine the forms

### Nested Decision Models

In discussing entrepreneurial decision-making, Angie touches on how relational reasoning applies to the nested logit model, which relaxes the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption:

"Nested logic relaxes independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption. So for instance, if you have a model like, for instance, this is your origin. This is mostly developed in transportation, and this is the destination. And let's say you have a toothpaste, and let's say new paths appears, and this somehow the original toothpaste now became three different paths. But it is very awkward to model this as two paths to three paths."

This example illustrates how relational reasoning helps entrepreneurs understand how adding new options (paths) changes the relationship between existing options.

### Investor Hierarchical Models

Angie suggests that entrepreneurs should build hierarchical models to understand investor behavior:

"For instance, investor archetype, you can somehow build a hierarchical model of a hardware industry and software industry, and how much like, what is the prior for their investment and the time it takes to exit, for instance."

This shows how relational reasoning helps entrepreneurs understand patterns across different levels of industry investment behavior.

## Bottleneck Breaking

Angie describes entrepreneurs' mode of operation as "bottleneck breaking" - a clear application of relational reasoning:

"What they operate, the mode of operation, is bottleneck breaking. So imagine you have the full uncertainty in customer, investor and technology side, and you are calculating what is the highest bang per buck, if you can measure the value of lowering certain amount of uncertainty."

This approach involves identifying relationships between different sources of uncertainty and determining which relationships, when clarified, would provide the greatest reduction in overall uncertainty.

## Application in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

Relational reasoning helps entrepreneurs to:

1. **Map Decision Interdependencies**: Understand how choices in one area affect options in others
2. **Navigate Complex Systems**: Make sense of multi-faceted business ecosystems
3. **Prioritize Information Gathering**: Focus on relationships that, when understood, unlock the greatest value
4. **Create Coherent Strategies**: Develop approaches where decisions across domains reinforce each other

For entrepreneurs, relational reasoning provides the cognitive tools to navigate complex, interconnected business environments where simple linear thinking would be insufficient.
