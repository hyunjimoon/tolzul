**Jinhua** is a domain expert in urban mobility and transportation systems who partners with us. He offers insights on how our venture fits into the larger transportation ecosystem, including policy and network effects. Jinhua is **highly optimistic about innovative mobility solutions** and consistently urges us to **think on a system level**. For example, he has emphasized understanding **network effects**: how the value of our service can grow as more users, vehicles, or cities join in. This perspective directly influenced our [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🟢Employee/Angie/Networked Learning Experiments]] approach. Jinhua often says things like, _“One small pilot can have ripple effects across the transit network,”_ reinforcing that each experiment we conduct is connected to broader possibilities. He has also guided us on regulatory and institutional considerations – essentially how to collaborate with city agencies or navigate policy frameworks so that our experiments can scale into real-world deployments. This ties into viewing our work as part of a mobility **ecosystem** rather than an isolated product. In discussions, Jinhua’s optimism shines when he imagines future scenarios (e.g. autonomous shuttles integrated with public transit) and pushes us to aim for those, while still gathering evidence stepwise. He appreciates our use of advanced tools like simulation and modeling ([[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🟢Employee/Angie/Probabilistic Mental Modeling]]) to anticipate outcomes in complex transit systems. Moreover, Jinhua has been a conduit to resources like the MIT Mobility Initiative (even sharing relevant talks and research with us; see references in [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Key Papers and Tools]]). In essence, Jinhua ensures our venture remains **visionary yet relevant**: he broadens our horizons to city-scale impact, all the while cheering on our experimental progress.
