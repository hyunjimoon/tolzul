Climate change and urbanization are straining traditional transportation. **Cities and commuters face rising congestion, pollution, and inadequate transit options**, creating an urgent need for new solutions. No single company or agency can solve this alone â€“ **sustainable mobility innovation requires an ecosystem of collaborators** (startups, established firms, municipalities). Customers (the travelers and communities) ultimately benefit from these collaborative efforts, which aim to provide greener, more efficient mobility services. Our venture addresses this challenge by fostering such collaboration and continuously experimenting to find what works. _This contextual imperative motivates our [[ðŸŸ§amoon/ðŸŸ§grow/supplyR 1/ðŸŸ¢Employee/Angie/Bayesian Entrepreneurship in Mobility Ecosystems]] approach as a way to systematically discover effective transit solutions for end-users._
