_(Core Technology 1 of 5 – Learned from 15.083 Integer Optimization)_

One of our foundational techniques is to **break down big experiments into smaller, manageable tests**. Inspired by advanced optimization methods (like how a complex problem can be decomposed into simpler sub-problems), we now treat each entrepreneurial challenge not as one monolithic experiment but as a _series of modular experiments_. For example, instead of launching a full-scale pilot program in a city all at once, we decompose the approach: we might first test just the rider sign-up process in one neighborhood, then separately test vehicle routing efficiency in a simulation, and then test pricing strategy in a small focus group. Each of these is an “optimal sub-problem” that addresses one aspect of the venture. By solving each sub-problem, we gradually solve the larger problem of a scalable mobility service.
 
This decomposition mindset came directly from learning about **integer optimization and branch-and-bound algorithms** in an MIT course. Just as those algorithms systematically explore parts of a solution space, we systematically explore parts of our business model. The benefit is focus: smaller experiments yield clearer, more actionable data (less confounded by other variables). It also accelerates learning because multiple sub-experiments can sometimes be run in parallel. We fundamentally shifted to this view after realizing that treating each market test as a single do-or-die event was inefficient and risky. Now we identify key hypotheses and tackle them one by one or in logical groupings.

Our stakeholders have reacted to this approach in different ways. Some of our more skeptical mentors like [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Vikash]] and [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Moshe]] initially questioned whether slicing things too thin might miss the “big picture”. They are incentivized to ensure we don’t get lost in analysis, so they challenged us: _will a series of small wins add up to a viable venture?_ In response, we showed how the sub-experiments map to an integrated whole – essentially a structured plan where each piece of evidence builds towards de-risking the final product launch. Over time, they’ve seen that this method avoids false positives: by isolating variables, if something works, we know exactly why, and if it fails, we contain the damage. On the other hand, our optimistic partners like [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Charlie]] appreciate that this gives us many “at bats” – plenty of opportunities to find a configuration that works. Internally, we use tools to manage this process: think of it as applying agile development sprints to the realm of business model testing. Each sprint (experiment) has a goal and metrics, and at the end, we decide on the next branch of our decision-tree to explore. Decomposing experiments has now become second-nature in our methodology, ensuring that we learn rapidly and systematically with minimal wasted effort.
