## 🔁 **CR Spectrum with Bayesian Movement Classification**

### 🔵 High CR Zone (CR ≈ 0.7–0.9) — “Risk of Missed Demand”

|Industry Examples|Airlines, Hotels, Emergency Medical, SaaS, Trend Retail|
|---|---|
|**Bayesian Movement**|Start with **supply**, then test and grow demand|
|**Ideal Path**|(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)|

**Explanation**:

- These industries face **high Cu (underage cost)**.
    
- They can afford to “overbuild” modestly to ensure availability.
    
- **STRATEGY**: Build lean, but have minimum supply capacity to absorb initial demand. Then update beliefs based on real usage.

### ⚖️ Mid CR Zone (CR ≈ 0.5–0.6) — “Balanced Mismatch Risk”

|Industry Examples|Consumer Electronics, Streaming Services, Specialty Retail|
|---|---|
|**Bayesian Movement**|**Test both sides iteratively** — adapt supply to confirmed demand|
|**Ideal Path**|(0,0) → (0,1) ⇄ (1,1) — OR — (0,0) → (1,0) ⇄ (1,1)|

**Explanation**:

- These businesses must **actively experiment** in small increments.
    
- Building supply too early is risky, but so is missing demand.
    
- **STRATEGY**: Use **Bayesian updates** — test demand with MVPs, **partner with flexible suppliers**, or lease capacity to limit overage risk. Scale both dimensions together once validated.

### 🔴 Low CR Zone (CR ≈ 0.1–0.4) — “Risk of Oversupply”

|Industry Examples|Automotive, Real Estate, Clean Energy, Grocery Logistics|
|---|---|
|**Bayesian Movement**|Start with **demand validation**, delay supply commitment|
|**Ideal Path**|(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1)|

**Explanation**:

- Overbuilding is extremely expensive.
    
- These businesses must **prove there is demand** before investing in fixed assets or infrastructure.
    
- **STRATEGY**: Run demand pilots, secure LOIs or pre-orders, test markets before scaling operations.
