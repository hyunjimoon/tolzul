**Vikash** is one of our key resource partners, known for his pragmatic industry perspective. He often serves as a **skeptical voice** in our discussions, which is valuable for keeping our enthusiasm grounded. For example, Vikash emphasizes traditional diligence like _competitor analysis_ and rigorous risk assessment before jumping into new experiments. His incentive structure (perhaps as an industry veteran or potential investor) drives him to **minimize false positives** – he doesn’t want us chasing a mirage. This aligns with the “skeptic” persona in [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/SupplyR/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Optimism vs Skepticism]]: Vikash constantly challenges our assumptions and asks for evidence. When we proposed complex Bayesian modeling for our decisions, he cautioned us to also consider simpler benchmarks (he even pointed us to the “NSS” research paper for balance – see [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/SupplyR/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Key Papers and Tools]]). At the same time, Vikash’s skepticism isn’t negativism; it’s **productive pressure**. It pushes us to fortify our strategy with data and to address weaknesses early. Notably, when he saw the potential of our [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🟢Employee/Angie/Probabilistic Mental Modeling]] approach to provide concrete insights, he became more optimistic about that aspect. In summary, Vikash ensures we **justify our decisions rationally** and remain focused on validating the fundamentals before scaling up.
