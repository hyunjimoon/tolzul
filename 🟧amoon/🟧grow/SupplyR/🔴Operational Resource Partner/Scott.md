**Scott** is a strategy advisor who specializes in innovation ecosystems and entrepreneurial strategy. He encourages us to view our venture through a **broad strategic lens**. Scott is very **optimistic about the power of ecosystem dynamics** – he often reminds us that the success of a mobility startup can depend on building the right relationships with cities, suppliers, and even competitors. His guidance has reinforced our emphasis on an [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/supplyR 1/🟢Employee/Angie/Innovation Ecosystem Strategy]]. For instance, drawing on principles from economics and strategy research, Scott has highlighted how sharing knowledge and learning from the “stock of ideas” around us can accelerate our progress. He has connected this to practical steps like partnering with local transit authorities early, or participating in knowledge-sharing forums in the mobility industry. Scott’s optimism is balanced with a demand for coherence: he wants to see a _clear strategic narrative_. He’s been known to ask, _“How does this experiment move the needle in the bigger picture?”_ – pushing us to tie each test back to our long-term strategy. This has helped us ensure that our day-to-day experiments (small as they may be) collectively build towards a sustainable competitive advantage. Additionally, Scott has pointed us to formal strategy frameworks (such as work by Vanden Steen on formalizing strategy – see [[🟧amoon/🟧grow/SupplyR/🔴Operational Resource Partner/Key Papers and Tools]]), which helped in articulating and refining our choices. In summary, Scott’s role is to keep our **strategic compass** oriented: he reinforces the importance of ecosystem thinking and ensures our learning translates into a winning strategy narrative that we can also communicate to stakeholders and investors.
