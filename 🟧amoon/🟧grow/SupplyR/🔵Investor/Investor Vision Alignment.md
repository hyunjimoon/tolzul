Investors are most supportive when their outlook aligns with the foundersâ€™ vision. We recognize the importance of **investorâ€“founder belief alignment**. In practice, this means seeking out backers who share our confidence in sustainable mobility and our experiment-driven approach. For example, an optimistically inclined investor who believes in the autonomous vehicles future will resonate with a founderâ€™s bold plans, whereas a more skeptical investor might balk at long timelines. Our strategy is to target funding sources (like [[ðŸŸ§amoon/ðŸŸ§grow/SupplyR/ðŸ”µInvestor/MIT DesignX Accelerator]] or mission-driven VCs) that **buy into our vision of a collaborative mobility ecosystem**. When beliefs align, investors are more patient and supportive through iterative testing. This alignment reduces friction: we and our investors interpret results with a similar lens, preventing clashes where an overly skeptical investor might demand premature proof, or an over-optimistic one might push to scale too quickly. Ultimately, matching on vision and risk appetite (see [[ðŸŸ§amoon/ðŸŸ§grow/supplyR 1/ðŸ”´Operational Resource Partner/Optimism vs Skepticism]]) sets the stage for a healthier partnership and more consistent decision-making.
