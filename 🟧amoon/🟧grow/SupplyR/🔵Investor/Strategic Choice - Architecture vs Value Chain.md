One strategic decision we face is **whether to pursue an open architecture platform or a vertically integrated value chain**. An **architecture-driven strategy** means building a modular platform where other partners (e.g. transit apps, vehicle makers) can plug in, fostering an ecosystem. This can accelerate adoption and innovation, but requires ceding some control. In contrast, a **value-chain strategy** means integrating more of the supply chain ourselves (hardware, software, service delivery) to ensure quality and capture more value; this yields control but can slow scaling and demands more capital. We have discussed this choice extensively with mentors. For instance, [[ðŸŸ§amoon/ðŸŸ§grow/supplyR 1/ðŸ”´Operational Resource Partner/Charlie]] often highlights lessons from _Manufacturing Strategy_ (Fine, 1985) about aligning product architecture with business strategy. Weâ€™re analyzing whether our core technologies lend themselves to a platform model or if the market is better served by an end-to-end solution. Investors care about this choice because it affects growth potential and risk: a platform (architecture) might scale faster and attract ecosystem partners, while vertical integration can differentiate us but may be resource-intensive. **Our current approach is a hybrid** â€“ start integrated to prove the concept (ensuring a great customer experience) and gradually open up parts of the architecture to partners as we mature. This strategic choice is revisited as we learn more, using insights from key frameworks (see [[ðŸŸ§amoon/ðŸŸ§grow/supplyR 1/ðŸ”´Operational Resource Partner/Key Papers and Tools]] such as Fineâ€™s work) to guide the decision.
