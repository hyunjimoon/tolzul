applying marr's three levels from [[🗄️🧠vikash]]]

| Level | Description | SAFE Optimization Context |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Computational | Defines the problem and goal in terms of optimal behavior | Maximize expected utility: E[utility(i, c, M, s, f)] |
| | | Where utility = founder's share × price per share |
| | | Modeled using Bayesian decision theory |
| Algorithmic | Specifies the process for achieving the computational-level goal | Conversational inference process: |
| | | 1. Perceiving: Break down SAFE terms (investment, valuation cap) |
| | | 2. Probabilistic Reasoning: Model scenarios till Series A |
| | | 3. Planning: Refine terms based on ownership and dilution calculations |
| Implementation | Describes how the algorithm is realized in practice | Psychological factors: |
| | | - Cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, overconfidence) |
| | | - Communication strategies in negotiations |
| | | Technical infrastructure: |
| | | - Probabilistic programming platforms |
| | | - Domain-Specific Language for financial modeling |

This table illustrates how the rational-resource-strategy approach is applied across the three levels:

1. Computational Level: At this level, we define the core problem of maximizing expected utility for both founders and investors. This is expressed mathematically and incorporates Bayesian decision theory to handle uncertainty in future valuations.

2. Algorithmic Level: This level describes the process of conversational inference, which involves iteratively perceiving the situation, using probabilistic reasoning to evaluate options, and planning actions based on this analysis. In the SAFE context, this involves breaking down terms, modeling various scenarios, and refining the offer based on calculated outcomes.

3. Implementation Level: At this level, we consider both the psychological factors that influence decision-making (such as cognitive biases and negotiation strategies) and the technical infrastructure required to support the analysis (like probabilistic programming platforms and specialized modeling languages).
