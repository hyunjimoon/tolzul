product description

Explaining this product to users: The conversational valuation consultant would help make the term sheet negotiation process between entrepreneurs and investors more transparent, fair, and collaborative. By providing an objective, data-driven analysis of term sheet implications and company valuation, the tool empowers both parties to negotiate on a more level playing field with shared information. This promotes better alignment of incentives and fairer outcomes for all involved, while also saving time and reducing stress by guiding users through the complex term sheet negotiation. 

Step-by-step functions to an engineer: To build the conversational valuation consultant, the key steps would be: 1) Gather a database of real-world term sheet examples, potentially through web scraping or collaboration with venture mentors. 2) Analyze these term sheets to identify key clauses and how they interact with the company cap table, encoding this knowledge into probabilistic programs. 3) Develop valuation models to estimate the distribution of company valuations based on the term sheet parameters. 4) Create a natural language interface that allows entrepreneurs and investors to input their term sheet details and receive analysis and negotiation guidance. 5) Enable both parties to view and discuss the term sheet analysis together, facilitating a more transparent and aligned negotiation process.

as my goal and situation would guide how development process of this product would pan out, i judged including my (and my inference of my investors') value creation and capture hypothesis would be useful.

1. GenSQL implementation of modules using probabilistic programs:

- Prediction: GenSQL uses the PROBABILITY OF clause to compute conditional probabilities. For prediction, it can query the model for the likelihood of specific outcomes given certain conditions.

- Synthetic Data Generation: The GENERATE UNDER clause allows GenSQL to sample from the probabilistic model, creating synthetic data that matches the learned distribution. The GIVEN clause enables conditional generation.

- Anomaly Detection: GenSQL can compare the probability of data points under the full model versus a conditional model, identifying anomalies as instances where the conditional probability is significantly lower.

For Option Pool, we mostly use probabilistic reasoning. The process begins with a world model where the option pool size is determined by a balance between a company's future hiring needs and the founders' desire to minimize dilution. This model recognizes that the typical seed round option pool ranges from 10% to 20% post-money, with the entire pool coming from the founders' common stock. When we observe that "Bessemer Venture Partners has offered a term sheet with a 15% post-money option pool," we update our understanding of BVP's expectations and the current market standards. This allows us to reason about the implications of this offer on our effective valuation and formulate a strategy. We can then analyze our updated model to answer questions like "How can we justify a smaller option pool size based on our hiring budget and team completeness?" This probabilistic approach helps us navigate the trade-offs between having sufficient equity for future hires and maintaining founder ownership, while also considering BVP's assessment of our hiring needs.

For Board of Directors, we mostly use relational reasoning. The process focuses on understanding how board composition affects company control and governance. In early-stage companies, the trend is moving towards smaller boards with 3 members, typically in a 1-1-1 structure (1 founder, 1 investor, 1 independent) or sometimes a 2-1 structure favoring founders. When we observe that "BVP's term sheet proposes a 1-1-1 board composition," we update our understanding of BVP's governance expectations and the current market norms. This allows us to reason about the balance of control and the potential impact on major strategic decisions. We can then analyze this information to address questions like "How can we negotiate for a 2-1 board structure while addressing BVP's governance concerns?" This relational approach helps us understand the dynamics of board composition and negotiate for a structure that maintains founder control while providing sufficient oversight for investors.

For Founder Vesting, we mostly use social reasoning. The process considers how vesting schedules align founder and investor interests over time, typically over a 4-year period. The model recognizes key concepts like "cliff" periods, upfront vesting credit for work already done, and acceleration clauses for major events like company sales. When we observe that "BVP's term sheet includes standard 4-year vesting with no upfront credit for founders," we update our understanding of BVP's risk mitigation strategy and current market practices. This allows us to reason about the implications of these terms on founder motivation and long-term commitment. We can then analyze this information to address questions like "What vesting terms can we propose that balance our need for upfront credit with BVP's standard expectations?" This social reasoning approach helps us negotiate vesting terms that recognize past contributions and incentivize future performance, while also addressing BVP's need to ensure founder retention and alignment with company growth objectives.


In probabilistic reasoning for option pools, the process begins with a world model where the option pool size is determined by a company's hiring needs and negotiation power. To formalize this, a generative model could be defined as (define option-pool-size (company) (min 0.2 (max 0.1 (+ (* 0.5 (hiring-needs company)) (* 0.5 (negotiation-power company))))). As observations are made, such as "Bessemer Venture Partners has offered a term sheet with a 15% post-money option pool," this evidence is used to update our understanding of the world. We incorporate this information with a condition statement: (condition (= (option-pool-size 'company) 0.15)). From there, queries can be made, such as, "How can we justify a smaller option pool size based on our hiring plan and current team completeness?" which could be written as (query (optimal-pool-size 'company 'hiring-plan 'team-completeness)). By using Bayesian reasoning, the prior belief about the optimal option pool size is updated based on the observation, shifting our understanding from the prior (before BVP's offer) to the posterior (after the offer), allowing us to better justify our position with refined probabilities and a clear understanding of our hiring needs and team completeness.

4. Comparison table for food preferences vs. vesting situation:

| Aspect | Food | Vesting |
|--------|------|---------|
| Agents | Lio, Alex, Gabe | Founders, VCs |
| Goals | Get lunch at preferred restaurant | Secure funding while retaining equity |
| Plans | Navigate to chosen restaurant (walk/bike) | Negotiate vesting terms |
| Utility Types | - Utility from restaurant (food preference) <br> - Motion utility (ease of getting there) | - Utility from my incentive (founder) <br> - Utility from getting co-founder commitment (VC) |

In the food scenario, agents make decisions based on their preferences and the effort required to reach restaurants. Similarly, in the vesting scenario, founders and VCs negotiate based on their preferences for equity retention and commitment assurance. The utility in both cases balances immediate desires (food taste, equity) with longer-term considerations (travel effort, long-term commitment).


1. Glossary of main terms:

Terms:
• Option Pool: Shares reserved for future employee compensation, typically ranging from 10-20% of a company's equity.
• Board of Directors: Governing body overseeing company decisions, usually composed of founders, investors, and independent members.
• Vesting: Process by which employees gain ownership of options over time, typically over a 4-year period with a 1-year cliff.

Engine modules:
• Generation: Forecasting future or unknown values based on existing data by creating artificial data that mimics real data characteristics.
• Condition/Bayesian Inference: Updating one's beliefs over various aspects of the world, grounded in probability theory i.e. assigning higher credence to hypotheses that better explain the evidence, weighted against the backdrop of their prior beliefs.
• Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data that don't conform to expected behavior.

Additional explanation on optimal-pool-size function:
The optimal-pool-size function calculates the recommended option pool size based on several factors:
1. base-size: Determined by dividing the hiring plan by 100, providing a baseline percentage.
2. market-adjusted: Adjusts the base size according to talent market competitiveness (no change for low, +2% for medium, +5% for high).
3. vc-adjusted: Takes the maximum of market-adjusted size and VC demand, ensuring the pool meets VC expectations.
4. The final result is capped at 20% to prevent excessive dilution.

| Knowledge about the world    | Founders would like to get more control of the board (e.g. prevent CEO founder ousting) to the extent that VC would feel they have some say.      | The larger the option pool is, the  founder's ownership gets more diluted but can have higher hiring capabilities therefore growth.Observation on sudden increase of talent market competitiveness can make hiring plan more aggressive increasing option pool.                     | Vesting schedules align founder and investor interests over time. Upfront vesting rewards past work, while cliff periods protect against early departures.                                                            |

| Knowledge    | Option pool size decision has grow faster VS give up more ownership dilemma. Typically size is 5~15% with VC wanting higher size than founder. Hiring plan and talent market competition affects pool size. | Board of director decision has flexibility VS efficiency dilemma. Typically board consists of 3~5 people with founder-control, balanced, VC-control each (2-0-1), (1-1-1), (1-0-2) for (founder-independent-investor vote) type. | Vesting schedule decision has incentive VS alignment dilemma. Upfronting (immediately granting for past work) vs cliff (no vesting for initial 1yr), duration (typically 3~4 yrs) are choices that affects different state and speed toward full ownership. Giving more ownership faster motivates individuals but may misalign goals in company level. |
