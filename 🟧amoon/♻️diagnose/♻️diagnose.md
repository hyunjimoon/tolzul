# ♻️ Diagnose - Assess What's Missing

## 💸 EVALUATING Mode

**Primary Function**: Determine worthiness and appropriateness by appraising what is good/bad

### Key Activities
- Enforce integrity in decision-making
- Align action with values and principles
- Situate decisions within historical and cultural traditions
- Identify benefits and harms in current approaches

### Entrepreneurial Style
**Architect (NTJ)**: Strategic pattern use enabling efficient decisions but potentially rigid when wrong

### Core Questions
- **Who will adopt this theory and why?**
- **What are the practical implications?**
- **What's missing from current approaches?**
- **How do we evaluate true worth and impact?**

### Characteristics
- Worth reveals itself through context
- Decisions acquire weight and meaning against backdrop of values
- Transforms analysis into moral and practical inquiry
- Examines cultural identity and ethical implications

### Method
- **Quasiutilities Assessment**: Explicitly account for costs of theorizing
- **No Utility Initially**: Delay introducing utilities until full context understood
- Balance Type I and II errors in evaluation

- **Core Questions**: 
  - **Who will adopt this theory and why?**
  - **What are the practical implications?**
  - **What's missing from current approaches?**

### TPE Framework Answer
Entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and scholars will adopt this theory for its practicality in making resource-efficient decisions, clarity in risk assessment, and its nuanced predictions based on subjective beliefs. Future research directions involve further refining belief modeling and testing across diverse entrepreneurial contexts.

### Connection to ADGC Framework
This stage corresponds to the **💸 EVALUATING** phase in the TPE framework, where we determine what has value and what gaps need to be filled.
