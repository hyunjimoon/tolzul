| Function | Description | Airport Operations Optimization Context |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Perceiving | Reducing complex problems into manageable components | Breaking down airport operations into flight scheduling, resource allocation, gate assignment, crew management, and passenger handling; identifying key bottlenecks (e.g., fuelling, baggage handling, passenger movements) |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Making decisions based on modeled uncertainty and limited information | Prioritizing flights and allocating resources based on a dynamic prioritization matrix that considers multiple factors (e.g., Departure Time Urgency, Passenger Connections, Crew Duty Limits) and their probabilistic impacts |
| Planning | Adjusting strategies based on feedback and new information | Dynamically updating flight priorities, resource allocations, and operational decisions based on real-time data, changing conditions, and the evolving state of the prioritization matrix |
