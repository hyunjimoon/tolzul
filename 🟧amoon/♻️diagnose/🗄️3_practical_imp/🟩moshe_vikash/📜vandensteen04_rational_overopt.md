abstract: Rational agents with differing priors tend to be overoptimistic about their chances of success. In particular, an agent who tries to choose the action that is most likely to succeed, is more likely to choose an action of which he overestimated, rather than underestimated, the likelihood of success. After studying the comparative statics of this mechanism, I show that it also causes agents to attribute failure to exogenous factors but success to their own choice of action, to disproportionately believe that they will outperform others, to overestimate the precision of their estimates, and to overestimate their control over the outcome.

I also received commitment from Rahul Bahui (you may remember his phd student, Roma who took your class last semester) that he'll join most sessions with his phd students. He and I'll co-lead the session before yours. I intend to focus on assisting your session by building shared understanding on entrepreneurial decision making + motivate the need for inverse planning for both entrepreneur and society's perspective. 

Your presence would always be welcomed in any session as indicated in the Call for participation.pdf 

ridging some gap between your and our group's mental model so that boundary pushing can happen during our interaction. I'm very excited about this opportunity and thank both you and Scott for your teaching.
