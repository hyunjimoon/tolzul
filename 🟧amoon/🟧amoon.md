I'm a Ph.D. at MIT studying innovation and operations management with [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/),  [Scott Stern](https://www.scott-stern.com/), [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/). My past and future in [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fa14fcd5ihdq014k6v4h0/Angie-Moon-Resume.pdf?rlkey=y7eerk8e6yx028es2rq7vjmid&dl=0). 

I use probability, statistics, optimization theory to model entrepreneurial decision making. My main tool is probabilistic program. 

I desire to contribute to building the [[♻️world]] where every knows and acts to live an ergodic life. That's my [[🔴sun]] and surprise surprise, I'm the guinea pig.
