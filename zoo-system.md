# Edge Commons Zoo 🦁

## Quick Reference
- 👾 **ali** (Scott): Agitate - rebel/alternative thinking
- 🐢 **dig** (Moshe): Dissect - deep analysis and modeling  
- 🐅 **gen** (Vikash): Generate - synthesis across domains
- 🐙 **cal** (Charlie): Calibrate - ground ideas in reality

## Research Teams at Edge Commons
**Team Compel (👾+🐙)**: Scott & Charlie - Theory meets practice  
**Team Coordinate (🐢+🐅)**: Moshe & Vikash - Analysis meets synthesis  

## Two Work Modes
**Fast (👾+🐅)**: Revolutionary ideas + rapid synthesis  
**Deep (🐢+🐙)**: Patient analysis + systematic building

## How to Classify
1. Feel the content's core energy
2. Add animal emoji to filename OR inside the file
3. Trust your first instinct

## Examples
- `👾 Challenging Economics Orthodoxy.md`
- Inside notes: `2. 🐢 A Postcard to Henry Purcell - contemplative analysis`
- Search `🐅` to find all synthesis/connection pieces

## The Core Question
"Does this content agitate(👾), dissect(🐢), generate(🐅), or calibrate(🐙)?"

Remember: Files can migrate between animals as understanding evolves. The zoo is alive! 🌱

### Color-Based State Mapping
| Color     | State        | Animal | Core Function                     |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Green  | Capabilities | 🐢 dig | Analyze resources and constraints |
| 🟠 Orange | Goals        | 🐅 gen | Generate vision and objectives    |
| 🟣 Purple | Customer     | 👾 ali | Challenge assumptions about users |
| 🔴 Blue   | Offering     | 🐙 cal | Calibrate solutions to reality    |

### Action Pairs
| Action | Formula | Animals | Function |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Coordinate** | Capabilities + Goals | 🐢 + 🐅 | Ground vision in reality |
| **Compel** | Customer + Offering | 👾 + 🐙 | Match rebel needs with solutions |

### Variability Framework
| Market Type | Variability | Focus | Example | Strategy |
|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Commodities** | Low | Single animal | McDonald's (fast food) | 🐙 Operational execution |
| **Innovation** | High | All animals | MIT Education, Uber | 👾🐢🐅🐙 Full exploration |

### Real-World Applications
- **Low Variability** (exploit): Fast food, utilities, generic drugs → Focus on 🐙 cal
- **High Variability** (explore): Fashion, luxury goods, education → Use all four animals
- **Platform Business** (Uber): Network density metric unifies producer/customer utility
- **Newsvendor Model**: Pure 🐙 cal problem - calibrate between overage/underage

The triangles represent manager-customer tension resolved through metric unification.

## Obsidian Integration

### Graph View Colors
- 👾 ali: Purple (#8B00FF) - Revolutionary thinking
- 🐢 dig: Green (#228B22) - Deep analysis  
- 🐅 gen: Orange (#FF8C00) - Creative synthesis
- 🐙 cal: Blue (#1E90FF) - Practical execution

### Smart Connections Usage
Files with multiple animal tags naturally become bridges in your knowledge network.

### Dataview Queries
```dataview

## Edge Commons Poem
**👾Ali.**  
Agitates false consensus.  
Finds the crack.

**🐢Dig.**  
Dissects buried parameters.  
Models the choice.

**🐅Gen.**  
Generates impossible bridges.  
Sparks connection.

**🐙Cal.**  
Calibrates to reality.  
Ships it.

Four beasts. One thesis. 
Each paper you read feeds exactly one. 
Which one?
