# Edge Commons Zoo 🦁

## Quick Reference
- 👾 **ali** (Scott): Agitate - rebel/alternative thinking
- 🐢 **dig** (Moshe): Dissect - deep analysis and modeling  
- 🐅 **gen** (Vikash): Generate - synthesis across domains
- 🐙 **cal** (Charlie): Calibrate - ground ideas in reality

## Research Teams at Edge Commons
**Team Compel (👾+🐙)**: Scott & Charlie - Theory meets practice  
**Team Coordinate (🐢+🐅)**: Moshe & Vikash - Analysis meets synthesis  

## Two Work Modes
**Fast (👾+🐅)**: Revolutionary ideas + rapid synthesis  
**Deep (🐢+🐙)**: Patient analysis + systematic building

## How to Classify
1. Feel the content's core energy
2. Add animal emoji to filename OR inside the file
3. Trust your first instinct

## Examples
- `👾 Challenging Economics Orthodoxy.md`
- Inside notes: `2. 🐢 A Postcard to Henry Purcell - contemplative analysis`
- Search `🐅` to find all synthesis/connection pieces

## The Core Question
"Does this content agitate(👾), dissect(🐢), generate(🐅), or calibrate(🐙)?"

Remember: Files can migrate between animals as understanding evolves. The zoo is alive! 🌱

### Color-Based State Mapping
| Color     | State        | Animal | Core Function                     |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Green  | Capabilities | 🐢 dig | Analyze resources and constraints |
| 🟠 Orange | Goals        | 🐅 gen | Generate vision and objectives    |
| 🟣 Purple | Customer     | 👾 ali | Challenge assumptions about users |
| 🔴 Blue   | Offering     | 🐙 cal | Calibrate solutions to reality    |

### Action Pairs
| Action | Formula | Animals | Function |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Coordinate** | Capabilities + Goals | 🐢 + 🐅 | Ground vision in reality |
| **Compel** | Customer + Offering | 👾 + 🐙 | Match rebel needs with solutions |

### Variability Framework
| Market Type | Variability | Focus | Example | Strategy |
|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Commodities** | Low | Single animal | McDonald's (fast food) | 🐙 Operational execution |
| **Innovation** | High | All animals | MIT Education, Uber | 👾🐢🐅🐙 Full exploration |

### Real-World Applications
- **Low Variability** (exploit): Fast food, utilities, generic drugs → Focus on 🐙 cal
- **High Variability** (explore): Fashion, luxury goods, education → Use all four animals
- **Platform Business** (Uber): Network density metric unifies producer/customer utility
- **Newsvendor Model**: Pure 🐙 cal problem - calibrate between overage/underage

The triangles represent manager-customer tension resolved through metric unification.

## Obsidian Integration

### Graph View Colors
- 👾 ali: Purple (#8B00FF) - Revolutionary thinking
- 🐢 dig: Green (#228B22) - Deep analysis  
- 🐅 gen: Orange (#FF8C00) - Creative synthesis
- 🐙 cal: Blue (#1E90FF) - Practical execution

### Smart Connections Usage
Files with multiple animal tags naturally become bridges in your knowledge network.

### Dataview Queries
```dataview
LIST FROM #👾ali AND #🐅gen  // Fast mode files
LIST FROM #🐢dig AND #🐙cal   // Deep mode files
```

## Edge Commons Poem
**👾Ali.**  
Agitates false consensus.  
Finds the crack.

**🐢Dig.**  
Dissects buried parameters.  
Models the choice.

**🐅Gen.**  
Generates impossible bridges.  
Sparks connection.

**🐙Cal.**  
Calibrates to reality.  
Ships it.

Four beasts. One thesis. 
Each paper you read feeds exactly one. 
Which one?



# MSS(🫀: Organize entire tolzul filesystem with ADGC zoo, markovian(🧠))

## Current State (Sₜ)

- Zoo system: 👾ali, 🐢dig, 🐅gen, 🐙cal
- Existing structure: 🔴sun, 🟧amoon, ♻️world, spandrel
- Classification ready for entire `/tolzul` directory

## Objective Function (Oₜ)

Maximize: Σ[all_files] [animal_resonance × folder_coherence]

## Knowledge Extraction Matrix

g₁: Classify any file → MSS = "Feel energy, assign animal" g₂: Respect existing structure → MSS = "Add animal prefix/tag, keep location" g₃: Cross-folder patterns → MSS = "Same animal across folders = thematic link"

## Required Output

```yaml
/tolzul
  /🔴sun → tag thesis files with animals
  /🟧amoon → tag personal files with animals
  /♻️world → tag world files with animals
  /spandrel → bridge files get multiple animals
```

## Next State (Sₜ₊₁)

Systematically traverse all tolzul subdirectories, classifying each file.

**Prompt for new chat:** "I have ADGC zoo system (read /Users/hyunjimoon/MIT Dropbox/Angie.H Moon/tolzul/zoo-system.md). Help me classify ALL files in /tolzul directory tree by adding animal tags while preserving current folder structure."


# 🦁 The Zoo Manager's Guide to Beast Care

## Daily Feeding Schedule

```
🌅 Morning         🌞 Midday          🌙 Evening
   👾 ali             🐅 gen            🐢 dig
   (disruption)       (synthesis)        (analysis)

- Expose to diverse inputs daily
- Create collision spaces for ideas
- Partner with 🐢 dig for grounding

## Weekly Care Routine

|Day|Morning|Afternoon|
|---|---|---|
|Mon|👾 Challenge assumptions|🐙 Test solutions|
|Tue|🐢 Deep analysis|🐅 Connect findings|
|Wed|🐅 Synthesis sprint|👾 Disrupt conclusions|
|Thu|🐙 Implementation|🐢 Measure results|
|Fri|All beasts playground|Cross-pollination|

## Danger Signs 🚨

- **Starving 👾**: Everything feels stale
- **Starving 🐢**: Shallow understanding
- **Starving 🐅**: Siloed thinking
- **Starving 🐙**: Ideas without impact

## Growth Formula

```
Healthy Beast = Regular Feeding + Right Partners + Safe Habitat + Challenge
```

Remember: A thriving zoo needs all four beasts strong and interacting. Neglect one, and the whole ecosystem suffers!
