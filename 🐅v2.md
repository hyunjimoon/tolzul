### **1. Separating the Founder from the Venture**

ü§† (The Whip: The Founder as a Flawed Calculator)

The history of entrepreneurship research is haunted by a conceptual conflation of the founder and the venture. In this traditional view, the founder is treated as a simple, often flawed, information processor whose primary role is to correctly perceive and react to an external environment (Gartner, 1985 ; Chandler & Hanks, 1994 ). Behavioral literature, for instance, has extensively documented entrepreneurial "biases" like overconfidence or the illusion of control, framing them as deviations from rationality that must be corrected (Busenitz & Barney, 1997 ; Loch, 2017 ; Jiang & Liu, 2019 ). This perspective reduces the founder to a component within the venture's machinery‚Äîa component whose cognitive bugs are a primary source of failure. The venture's strategy is thus seen as a direct, and often distorted, reflection of the founder's mind.

ü•ï (The Carrot: The Founder as a Bayesian Experimenter)

We introduce a clean separation between the founder's subjective beliefs and the venture's objective strategic choices, a distinction absent in prior work. We reconceptualize the founder not as a biased calculator but as a Bayesian experimenter who holds a set of subjective priors (Agrawal et al., 2024). As Stern (2024) argues, no one is biased from their own perspective; they are simply acting rationally given their priors. Our framework models the founder's mind (Œº, aspiration) and the venture's external promise (œÜ, commitment) as distinct but linked variables. This separation allows us to see that a founder's unique worldview is not a bug but a feature‚Äîthe very source of the heterogeneous priors that drive novel experiments and create opportunities where others see none (Gans, Stern & Wu, 2019 ; Gambardella, Gius & Stern, forthcoming ).

### **2. Endogenizing Uncertainty: From One Source to Two**

ü§† (The Whip: The Monolithic View of Uncertainty)

Historically, the literature has treated uncertainty as a monolithic, external force of chaos that assaults the venture. Whether in operations management, which seeks to buffer against supply chain disruptions (Girotra & Netessine, 2011), or in strategy, which aims to navigate environmental turbulence, uncertainty is "the world happening to you". This view, which treats all unknowns as an exogenous curse (Phan & Chambers, 2018), offers the entrepreneur only defensive postures: build a fortress of plans or be nimble enough to dodge the arrows of fate. It provides no mechanism for proactively engaging with or shaping the nature of uncertainty itself.

ü•ï (The Carrot: Lighting a Counter-Fire with Designed Uncertainty)

Our central theoretical move is to dissect uncertainty into two distinct types: nature's complexity (c), which is the uncontrollable wildfire of the market, and founder's concentration (œÑ), which is the controllable, strategic uncertainty the founder chooses to create. This is the difference between Tesla, which kept œÑ low by remaining vague on battery chemistry, and Better Place, which chose a fatally high œÑ by promising a specific five-minute swap. By choosing a low œÑ, a founder can light a counter-fire: creating a firebreak of adaptive flexibility that buffers the venture from the raging wildfire of nature's complexity. Our model is the first to formalize this dual-uncertainty dynamic and provide a tool (œÑ) for founders to proactively design their informational environment.

### **3. Bridging Worlds: From Schism to Spectrum**

ü§† (The Whip: The Unproductive War of Schools)

For decades, a cold war has defined entrepreneurship theory. The Planning School (Porter, 1979; Camuffo et al., 2020; Brinckmann et al., 2010) and the Action School (Sarasvathy, 2001; Ries, 2011; Aulet, 2013) have operated from mutually exclusive assumptions, forcing a false choice between rigid roadmaps and seemingly chaotic improvisation. While Action School is highly active, it conceives of this activity as navigating or discovering a path through an uncertain world; it does not equip the founder to consciously architect the degree of uncertainty they face from the outset. This schism has left the field without a unified theory that can explain when and why a given approach is superior.

ü•ï (The Carrot: A Unified Theory of Strategic Precision)

Our framework definitively ends this war, not by picking a winner, but by revealing the two schools as specific cases of a more general theory. We show that the Planning School's preference for high-precision commitments is simply a high-œÑ strategy, while the Action School's preference for flexibility is a low-œÑ strategy. The choice is not philosophical but economic, dictated by the ratio V/ic. This dissolves the dichotomy into a continuous spectrum and provides a unified flavor, similar to the efforts show in "commercialization strategy compass" from Gans, Scott, Stern (2025) which provides quadrants of strategy for founders to simulate and choose from. The "success syndrome" described by Tushman & O'Reilly (1996), where successful firms become rigid and fail to adapt, is precisely what our model identifies as a "learning trap": a state of excessively high œÑ where the cost of changing a successful formula becomes prohibitive, preventing exploration of new opportunities.

### **4. Implementing the Theory: Financial Architecture as Uncertainty Design**

ü§† (The Whip: Finance as a Tool of Control)

Venture finance has traditionally been framed as a mechanism to mitigate agency costs and reduce information asymmetry (Hellman & Puri, 2000 üê¢; Gompers, 1995). In this view, term sheets are instruments of control and staged financing is a tool for monitoring, both designed to force founders towards transparency and eliminate uncertainty. This perspective, rooted in Jensen & Meckling's (1976) agency theory, fails to explain why the rigid elimination of uncertainty can be value-destructive, and it offers no guidance on how to structure contracts that preserve the valuable optionality inherent in ambiguity.

ü•ï (The Carrot: Term Sheets as Calibrated Priors)

We reconceptualize financial architecture as the practical implementation of our theory. A term sheet is not just a contract; it is a calibrated prior on the venture's promise. Our framework allows us to translate financial instruments into the language of our model: equity financing, which embraces upside ambiguity, is a low-œÑ instrument, while milestone-based debt is a high-œÑ instrument. The claim that our model offers a formal theory of when less information is superior is indeed bold but precise: it is superior when V/ic < 1. This aligns with findings from scholars like Omar Besbes at Columbia, who has shown the value of dropping data in certain operational contexts; our work provides a specific entrepreneurial mechanism for this phenomenon. Regarding the "Bayesian Cringe", our argument is nuanced. Gelman encourages using informative priors if you have trustworthy information. We argue that founders must first assess the cost of trusting that information. Better Place had "precise" data on swap times but naively used a tight prior (œÑ -> ‚àû) without considering the astronomical integration cost (i). Tesla, conversely, had data on battery performance but cringed at the cost of premature commitment, rationally choosing a more diffuse prior (low œÑ) for its public promise. Finally, our framework operationalizes the philosophical concept of Alvarez & Porac (2020) üêôüêô, who foregrounded uncertainty by arguing it is not just risk but an indeterminate future constructed by managers. Our model provides the specific tool (œÑ) through which that construction and calibration takes place at the negotiating table.
