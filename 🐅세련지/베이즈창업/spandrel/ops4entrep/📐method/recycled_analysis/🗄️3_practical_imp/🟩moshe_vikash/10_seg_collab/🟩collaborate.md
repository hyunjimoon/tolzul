COLLABORATION

Very few firms can do it all themselves. Most start-ups collaborate with supplier partners, channel partners, technology partners, distribution partners, etc. Especially when the firm is small, partnering can be challenging, because a small start-up has little leverage with a large supplier or distributor.

A successful young firm that has already started scaling has potentially much more leverage to develop relationships with attractive partners.

However, collaborative relationships typically require some manner of sharing the pie. Thus, a collaborator is often both a value-adding partner and a competitor for a share of the total value-chain profits available.

Sometimes collaboration can be a short-term engagement (sharing resources for example), sometimes it can lead to more significant relationships that might eventually evolve into a merger or acquisition opportunity

Strategic suppliers or distributors can significantly extend the reach of the growing company to sources or customers that might not otherwise be accessible

Collaboration helps companies scale as long as it can provide mutual benefits, is meaningful and mission-driven, and is based on complementary skills, interests, or goals.

However, such relationships can add complexity, as the scaling organization must balance multiple interests while keeping an eye on its own long-term goals.
