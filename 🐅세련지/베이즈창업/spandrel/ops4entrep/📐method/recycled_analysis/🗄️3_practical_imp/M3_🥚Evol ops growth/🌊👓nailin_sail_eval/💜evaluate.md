| **Mockup**                       | A visual representation or sketch of the product, focusing on appearance and concept without functionality.                                  | Drawing a dream smartphone case with colors, a solar panel, and a kickstand on paper to visualize the idea.            |
| **Prototype**                    | A 3D model of the product, often non-functional, to explore design and size aspects.                                                         | Building a cardboard model of the smartphone case with a plastic panel for the solar panel and a paper kickstand.      |
| **Proof of Concept**             | Demonstration that the core technology can work as intended, focusing on functionality over design.                                          | Connecting a small solar panel to a basic charging circuit and attaching it to a simple case to charge a phone.        |
| **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** | A basic, functional version of the product ready for initial <font color  = "#C0A0C0">user testing</font>, incorporating essential features. | Creating a usable smartphone case that charges the phone effectively, looks good, and is durable enough for daily use. |
