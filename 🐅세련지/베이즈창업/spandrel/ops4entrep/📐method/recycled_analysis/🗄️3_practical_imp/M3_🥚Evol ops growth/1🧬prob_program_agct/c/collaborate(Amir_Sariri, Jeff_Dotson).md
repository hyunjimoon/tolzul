This document outlines a research proposal investigating the relationship between company ownership structure, industry competitiveness, and revenue growth. The hypothesis suggests that in highly competitive, fast-moving industries (measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and industry clockspeed), companies with concentrated ownership (top-heavy cap tables) will experience higher revenue growth compared to those with distributed ownership. The study proposes a multiple regression model to test this hypothesis, using variables such as ownership concentration, industry clockspeed, and industry competition. The research aims to provide insights into the "grow faster vs. control" tradeoff across different industry contexts, potentially helping founders, investors, and policymakers make informed decisions about company ownership structures. The document also includes details on data collection methods, expected outcomes, and potential implications of the study.
