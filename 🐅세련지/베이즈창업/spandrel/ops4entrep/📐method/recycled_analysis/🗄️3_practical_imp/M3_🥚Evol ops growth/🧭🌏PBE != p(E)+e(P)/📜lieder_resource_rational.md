Resource-rational analysis: Understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources

Modeling human cognition is challenging because there are infinitely many mechanisms that can generate any given observation. Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resourcerational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind‚Äôs most impressive cognitive skills with people‚Äôs ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.

Let me create a comprehensive table summarizing this paper, organized by research phases and using relevant emojis from the symbolic system.

This table organizes the key elements from each section while using the emoji system to highlight the progression from abstract theoretical frameworks (üó∫Ô∏è) through specific cognitive mechanisms (üß≠) to implications for understanding human cognition (üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). The progression shows how resource rationality provides an integrated framework for understanding both the capabilities and limitations of human cognition.
