The updated hypotheses aim to capture the nuances of pivoting and expanding in the context of each hyper-parameter while addressing the three root problems of social science's non-cumulativeness:
1. High causal density: The hypotheses consider multiple factors (market dynamics, uncertainty, optimism, experiment opportunity, and risk-cash tolerance) that jointly influence entrepreneurial decision-making, acknowledging the complex causal relationships in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
2. Changes over time: The hypotheses emphasize the dynamic nature of markets and the need for startups to adapt through pivoting or expanding their product and market strategies over time.
3. Variables that are difficult to measure / nuisance variables / open concepts: The hypotheses provide a structured framework to measure and analyze the impact of various hyper-parameters on entrepreneurial decision-making, reducing the ambiguity associated with these variables and enabling more cumulative research in the field.
By providing this dynamic canvas, the updated hypotheses contribute to making entrepreneurial decision-making science more cumulative and aligned with the goals outlined in the Almaatouq et al. (2023) paper on integrative experiment design in the social and behavioral sciences.
