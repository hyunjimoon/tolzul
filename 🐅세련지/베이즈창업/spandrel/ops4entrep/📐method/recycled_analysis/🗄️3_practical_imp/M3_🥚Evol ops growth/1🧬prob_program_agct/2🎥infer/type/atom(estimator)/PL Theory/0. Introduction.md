#ProgrammingLanguages

### Introduction
To write a program is to describe to a computer instructions on carrying out specific commands in a specific fashion. It's not much different from natural language in the sense that each statement=sentence holds some meaning that can be mapped to some semantic construct. For example, we know that "I ate an apple" means that the subject of the sentence, I, performed an act of consuming the object, apple.

In PL theory, we seek to map out the semantics of programming language constructs, under an universally agreed language: mathematics.

This will be a series of notes referenced from Reynolds' book, "Theories of Programming Languages", and related lecture notes.
