 Humans often represent and reason about unrealized possible actions ‚Äì the vast inÔ¨Ånity of things that were not (or have not yet been) chosen. This capacity is central to the most impressive of human abilities: causal reasoning, planning, linguistic communication, moral judgment, etc. Nevertheless, how do we select possible actions that are worth considering from the inÔ¨Ånity of unrealized actions that are better left ignored? We review research across the cognitive sciences, and Ô¨Ånd that the possible actions considered by default are those that are both likely to occur and generally valuable. We then offer a uniÔ¨Åed theory of why. We propose that (i) across diverse cognitive tasks, the possible actions we consider are biased towards those of general practical utility, and (ii) a plausible primary function for this mechanism resides in decision making.

| Introduction | How do humans efficiently choose which unrealized possible actions to consider from an infinite set? | ‚Ä¢ Marr (1982) on computational analysis<br>‚Ä¢ Research on modal cognition and possibilities | The ability to represent and reason about unrealized possible actions is central to high-level cognition but requires efficiently selecting relevant possibilities from an infinite set | ‚Ä¢ Examples: choosing cities to move to, judging others' actions, assigning responsibility |
| Traditional Approaches | How have different fields traditionally modeled reasoning about possibilities? | ‚Ä¢ Research on possible worlds semantics<br>‚Ä¢ Work on mental models<br>‚Ä¢ Studies of counterfactual thinking | Prior approaches focus on partitioning possibility spaces and ordering possibilities but don't explain which specific possibilities come to mind | ‚Ä¢ Philosophical models using possible worlds<br>‚Ä¢ Psychological work on mental models<br>‚Ä¢ Linguistics research on modal terms |
| Default Representations of Possible Actions | What consistent patterns emerge in how people initially represent possible actions? | ‚Ä¢ Studies of possibility judgments<br>‚Ä¢ Work on causal attribution<br>‚Ä¢ Research on linguistic modality | Default representations of possible actions consistently favor those that are probable and valuable across diverse cognitive domains | ‚Ä¢ Children judge morally wrong actions "impossible"<br>‚Ä¢ Causal attributions focus on probable alternatives<br>‚Ä¢ Modal language sensitive to both probability and value |
| Functional Role in Decision Making | Why do default representations favor probable and valuable actions? | ‚Ä¢ Research on consideration sets<br>‚Ä¢ Work on reinforcement learning<br>‚Ä¢ Studies of expertise | This pattern likely stems from the function of identifying practical options during decision making - sampling higher utility actions improves efficiency | ‚Ä¢ Chess experts consider better moves first<br>‚Ä¢ Consumer decisions shaped by initial consideration sets<br>‚Ä¢ AI systems use similar sampling strategies |
| Two-Stage Model | How do sampling and evaluation processes interact in decision making? | ‚Ä¢ Work on fast vs slow decision systems<br>‚Ä¢ Research on cached vs computed values | A quick sampling stage based on cached approximate values is followed by more precise evaluation of sampled options | ‚Ä¢ Cached values allow rapid generation of candidates<br>‚Ä¢ Detailed evaluation only of sampled subset<br>‚Ä¢ Balance between accuracy and computational cost |
| Broader Implications | What are the implications for understanding modal cognition and its origins? | ‚Ä¢ Work on development of possibility concepts<br>‚Ä¢ Research on individual differences<br>‚Ä¢ Studies of modal cognition across tasks | Default modal cognition may derive core properties from its role in decision making, explaining consistent biases across diverse cognitive tasks | ‚Ä¢ Predicts similar biases across domains<br>‚Ä¢ Explains development of modal concepts<br>‚Ä¢ Accounts for effects of time pressure |
