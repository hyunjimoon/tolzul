# ANSWER
## 1.
Why would you like to attend Path of Professorship? Your answer may include (but is not limited to): 
1) Your personal or academic journey to MIT and future goals.
2) Questions or concerns about a career in academia that you are hoping to have answered.
3) What perspective you can uniquely contribute to the event.
Responses should be between 500 and 1000 characters.

> My research explores how organizations balance flexibility with commitment—a tension I face navigating academia. Early-career scholars from non-traditional backgrounds often excel at boundary-spanning work, yet tenure systems reward narrow specialization. This creates a paradox: maintain intellectual flexibility and risk appearing unfocused, or commit prematurely to constraints that limit innovative potential. My work on entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty offers frameworks for managing this trade-off systematically. I seek guidance on calibrating my trajectory: How do I signal rigor while preserving space for unexpected discoveries? When should exploratory research crystallize into defined programs? How can institutions better support scholars whose strength lies in connecting disparate fields? Understanding how successful academics have navigated these tensions—particularly those who've maintained interdisciplinary approaches—would help me design my own path strategically rather than reactively."

What are you hoping to learn or get out of this workshop? *
(This will not affect your acceptance, but will serve to help us better tailor the programming and resources to attendees) Responses should be less than 300 characters

> How to frame interdisciplinary work as strategic rather than scattered. Which institutions truly value breadth. Negotiating resources for unconventional trajectories. Building evaluation metrics that recognize community-building alongside publications. Managing the transition from exploration to focus.
## 3.
How have issues related to gender equity influenced your academic journey?  Responses should be between 500 and 1000 characters

> Gender equity issues reveal how academia applies different standards to similar work. Exploratory research becomes 'visionary' or 'unfocused' depending on who presents it. Collaborative approaches signal either 'leadership' or 'dependence.' Theoretical ambition reads as either 'groundbreaking' or 'overreaching.' These asymmetric interpretations shape scholarly trajectories—pushing some toward defensive over-formalization while others maintain productive flexibility. My research on decision-making under uncertainty emerged partly from observing these patterns: how identical behaviors yield different outcomes based on who performs them. The energy required to navigate these inconsistent standards represents a hidden tax on innovation. This workshop offers something valuable: recognition that excellence takes multiple forms and that structural barriers affect how we develop as scholars. I seek to learn from others who've maintained their intellectual distinctiveness despite pressure toward narrow conformity.
