progression "I-IV-V" refers to the primary chords in a given musical key:

- **I (Tonic):** This is the "home" chord, built on the first note of the scale. It provides a sense of rest and resolution.
- **IV (Subdominant):** This chord is built on the fourth note of the scale. It creates a sense of movement away from the tonic, but not strong tension.
- **V (Dominant):** This chord is built on the fifth note of the scale. It creates the strongest sense of tension and a strong pull back to the tonic (I), driving the music forward towards a resolution.

This I-IV-V progression is foundational because it establishes the key and creates a clear journey from home (I), through a departure (IV), to a point of tension (V), and back to resolution (I). You can build paper sections like these I-IV-V progressions.
Okay, Angie, here's the updated table incorporating G Major and A Minor, with the corresponding I-IV-V chords:
