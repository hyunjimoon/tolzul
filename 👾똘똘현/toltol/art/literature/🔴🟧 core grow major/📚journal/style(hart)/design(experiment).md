| **Detailed Methodology**                                 | **STRAP Framework Implementation**:<br>The Strategic Triangulation for Resource Allocation and Prioritization (STRAP) will be implemented as a computational decision support system with three components:<br><br>1. **Stakeholder Modeling Module**:<br>- Bayesian belief networks representing entrepreneur's model of customer preferences and resource partner capabilities<br>- Prior elicitation interface to capture initial beliefs about key uncertainties<br>- Posterior updating mechanisms following experimental outcomes<br><br>2. **Experiment Design Module**:<br>- Library of experiment types for both market validation and operational verification<br>- Expected information gain calculator for each experiment type<br>- Resource requirement estimator for experiments<br>- Optimization algorithm for experiment selection based on uncertainty reduction per resource unit<br><br>3. **Uncertainty Visualization Module**:<br>- "Front-back window fog clearing" visual interface showing uncertainty in both domains<br>- Dynamic updating as experiments yield results<br>- Alignment indicator showing potential gaps between selling and delivering promises |
| **Key Variables, Measurements, and Analytical Approach** | **Independent Variables**:<br>- Prior beliefs about customer preferences (distribution parameters)<br>- Prior beliefs about operational capabilities (distribution parameters)<br>- Resource constraints (time, capital, human resources)<br>- Experiment selection strategy (STRAP vs. alternatives)<br><br>**Dependent Variables**:<br>- Market uncertainty reduction (measured by entropy reduction in belief distributions)<br>- Operational uncertainty reduction (measured by entropy reduction in belief distributions)<br>- Promise alignment gap (measured by divergence between customer expectations and operational capabilities)<br>- Resource efficiency (uncertainty reduction per unit resource)<br><br>**Analytical Approach**:<br>- Bayesian hierarchical modeling to capture belief updating<br>- Information-theoretic measures for uncertainty quantification<br>- Counterfactual simulations comparing STRAP to alternative strategies<br>- Statistical comparison of outcomes across experimental conditions                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Expected Results and Theoretical Connection**          | **Expected Results**:<br>1. The STRAP framework will lead to more balanced uncertainty reduction across market and operational domains compared to market-focused or operations-focused approaches.<br><br>2. Promise alignment gaps will be smaller with STRAP than with alternative approaches, particularly in scenarios with high initial uncertainty in both domains.<br><br>3. Resource efficiency will be higher with STRAP compared to sequential approaches that first focus on market validation and then on operational verification.<br><br>4. The optimal balance of market vs. operational experiments will vary based on prior beliefs, demonstrating the importance of subjective priors in experiment design.<br><br>**Theoretical Connection**:<br>These results would support the integration of subjective Bayesian decision theory with operational management in entrepreneurship. The findings would demonstrate that experimental design in entrepreneurship should account for both heterogeneous priors (from Bayesian entrepreneurship theory) and the need to balance multiple domains of uncertainty (extending beyond current market-focused approaches).     |
| **Preliminary Findings**                                 | **Conceptual Validation**:<br>Initial conversations with entrepreneurs and advisors have validated the core premise that balancing "selling promise" and "delivering promise" is a critical challenge in the "nail it" phase. Case analysis of failed startups reveals patterns of misalignment between customer expectations and operational capabilities.<br><br>**Computational Prototype**:<br>A simplified version of the STRAP framework has been implemented in Python, demonstrating the feasibility of quantifying and visualizing dual-domain uncertainty. Simulations with synthetic data show that balanced uncertainty reduction strategies outperform domain-focused strategies in scenarios with uncertainty in both domains.<br><br>**Case Study Analysis**:<br>Retrospective application of STRAP principles to Charlie Fine's case studies shows that successful cases exhibited better alignment between customer promises and operational capabilities, while failures often showed growing misalignment over time.                                                                                                                                                     |
