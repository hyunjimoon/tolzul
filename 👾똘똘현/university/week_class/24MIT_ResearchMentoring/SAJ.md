Effective Communication:
- Active listening is crucial and involves giving full attention, avoiding distractions, asking questions, and demonstrating understanding
- Listeners should strive to make the speaker feel heard and understand their perspective
- Establishing clear intentions for the conversation upfront can improve communication effectiveness
- Nonverbal cues like eye contact and facial expressions can impact perceptions of listening, and these cues may vary across cultures

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI):
- Diversity encompasses many dimensions beyond race/ethnicity, including background, communication style, abilities, and more 
- Mentors should recognize their biases and that mentees may have very different identities and experiences from them
- Examining one's assumptions and taking mentees' perspectives can enhance understanding across differences
- Mentors must balance encouraging and supporting underrepresented mentees without making them feel singled out or stereotyped
- Discussing and addressing DEI issues openly, even when uncomfortable, is necessary for progress

The SAJ framework characterizes three modes of thought:
1. **Scientist**: Focuses on understanding what will happen by identifying the causal relationships in a situation.
2. **Artist**: Imagines what might happen by envisioning new possibilities and alternative scenarios.
3. **Judge**: Evaluates the (dis)utility of what happens, assessing the moral, ethical, and practical implications of various actions.

Cronin (2024) explains one needs at least two modes of thinking to serve certain function. I analyzed effective communication and DEI from each perspective.

|   | Effective Communication | Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) |
|---|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|SJ (Scientist & Judge)| - Systematically analyze patterns in communication breakdowns and develop evidence-based strategies to improve <br>- Rigorously assess communication strategies against ethical standards and organizational values around respect and inclusion<br>- Use validated metrics to track and incentivize progress in communication effectiveness | - Leverage research to accurately diagnose root causes of inequities and identify high-impact solutions<br>- Develop clear criteria, based on organizational values, for evaluating the inclusiveness of policies and practices<br>- Implement measurement systems to track diversity data, identify disparities, and assess DEI initiatives|
|SA (Scientist & Artist)| - Expand perspective-taking abilities to imagine alternative interpretations during miscommunications<br>- Experiment with creative communication strategies like storytelling and test their impact <br>- Discover new insights about communication by examining outliers and  "positive deviant" examples| - Imagine new frameworks for conceptualizing diversity that go beyond current categories and groupings <br>- Explore novel strategies for building inclusive cultures by learning from analogous challenges in other contexts<br>- Use data to surface hidden patterns of inequity and generate hypotheses about unrecognized barriers|
|AJ (Artist & Judge)| - Develop communication approaches that authentically embody and advance organizational values<br>- Envision aspirational futures where candid, respectful communication is the norm and inspire others toward that vision<br>- Design aesthetically and emotionally compelling communication that resonates across differences | - Articulate an inspiring, values-based vision of DEI as an organizational ideal and moral imperative<br>- Notice and amplify underrepresented perspectives that are missing in dominant DEI narratives <br>- Create initiatives that promote the experience of inclusion, belonging and being valued among diverse members|
