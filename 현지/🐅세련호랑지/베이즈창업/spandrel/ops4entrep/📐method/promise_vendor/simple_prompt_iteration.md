# üîÑ Simple Prompt Iteration System

## The Master Prompt Template

```
You are writing about [TOPIC]. Follow these rules:

1. Start with action, not theory
2. Each sentence must connect to the next (if you can reorder them, you've failed)
3. Use simple words for complex ideas
4. Vary sentence length. Short punches. Longer sentences create rhythm and flow.
5. Cut the last 15% before sending

Write as if explaining to a busy friend who needs tools, not theory.

## How to Test (Reality Check)

**Running on 3 platforms is manual but quick (~5 minutes):**
1. **Claude**: You're already here - just paste the prompt
2. **ChatGPT**: Open chat.openai.com in new tab, paste prompt
3. **Gemini**: Open gemini.google.com in new tab, paste prompt

## Quick Evaluation (Look for these 3 things)

After getting all 3 responses, ask:

1. **Do sentences flow?** Read aloud. If you stumble, mark it.
2. **Too many abstract nouns?** Count things like "optimization," "utilization," "implementation" 
3. **Does it end too late?** Usually yes. Cut the last paragraph.

## Find 3 Holes (Where ALL platforms failed)

Common holes:
- üï≥Ô∏è All three got wordy ‚Üí Add "Maximum 200 words" to prompt
- üï≥Ô∏è All three used jargon ‚Üí Add "Explain like I'm smart but busy"
- üï≥Ô∏è All three had weak transitions ‚Üí Add example of good flow

## Update Your Prompt

## Track What Works

Keep a simple log:

**Iteration 1 - Date**
- Task: Explain Bayesian thinking for entrepreneurs
- Hole 1: Too abstract ‚Üí Fixed by adding concrete example requirement
- Hole 2: Too long ‚Üí Added word limit
- Hole 3: Weak flow ‚Üí Added transition example

**Iteration 2 - Date**
- Task: [Next topic]
- [Continue pattern]

## Pro Tips

1. **Test the same prompt 3x** - The weakness patterns become obvious
2. **Start specific** - "Explain why a startup should pivot" beats "Explain decision-making"
3. **Read aloud** - Your ear catches what your eye misses
4. **Actually cut 15%** - It always improves the writing

## The Moran Test

Print any response. Draw boxes around sentences. Can you shuffle them?
- **Yes** = Failed (needs better flow)
- **No** = Passed (sentences connect properly)

---

That's it. One prompt, three tests, three fixes. Repeat until the writing flows.
