| Inferred State        | • living in 19th century                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Inventory Challenges  | • Have 600 ships, each like a floating warehouse<br>• Significant inventory management problems<br>• Overbought spare parts, including for things that never break<br>• Unable to track what they have in inventory |
| Proposed Project      | • Looking to implement a new procurement system                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Relevance to Research | • Tom Malone's team was assigned to work with Synergy Marine<br>• Seen as relevant for supply chain resilience research                                                                                             |
| Suggested Approach    | • Viewed more as an operations management problem than an AI problem<br>• Speakers suggest traditional spare parts management research is relevant                                                                  |
| Scale of Problem      | • 600 ships, each with extensive inventory<br>• Inventory much larger than a typical house basement                                                                                                                 |
