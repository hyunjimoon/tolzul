## Key Concepts

### Fast Fashion Industry Characteristics
- **Short Product Life Cycles:** Seasonal and micro-seasonal trends
- **High Demand Uncertainty:** Fashion preferences unpredictable
- **Time Sensitivity:** Speed to market critical for capturing trends
- **Price Competition:** Affordable fashion for mass market
- **Inventory Risk:** High obsolescence costs for unsold items

### Traditional Fashion Retail Model
- **Long Lead Times:** 4-6 months from design to store
- **Forecast-Driven:** Production based on seasonal predictions
- **Batch Production:** Large quantities for economies of scale
- **Mark-down Risk:** High discounting for unsold inventory
- **Limited Responsiveness:** Cannot react to in-season trends

### Zara's Revolutionary Model
- **Quick Response:** 2-3 weeks from concept to store
- **Test and React:** Small initial quantities, scale successful items
- **Vertical Integration:** Control over design, production, distribution
- **Information Integration:** Real-time sales feedback drives decisions
- **Postponement:** Delay final product decisions until demand is clearer

## Zara's Operational Capabilities

### Supply Chain Architecture
1. **Design Centers:** Trend spotting and rapid design
2. **Local Production:** 50% produced in Spain/Portugal/Morocco
3. **Global Sourcing:** 50% from Asia for basic items
4. **Distribution Network:** Centralized in Spain, frequent shipments
5. **Retail Network:** Company-owned stores worldwide

### Production Strategy
- **Time-Sensitive Items:** Local production (higher cost, faster response)
- **Basic Items:** Global sourcing (lower cost, longer lead times)
- **Flexible Capacity:** Ability to scale production quickly
- **Small Batches:** Reduced risk, increased freshness

### Information Systems

## Discussion Questions for Class

### Question 1: Customer Value Proposition
**Prompt:** What are the key differences between a more traditional apparel retailer (such as Gap) and Zara from a customer standpoint?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Product Freshness:** New designs every 2 weeks vs. seasonal collections
- **Scarcity Appeal:** Limited quantities create urgency
- **Trend Responsiveness:** Current fashion vs. predicted trends
- **Price-Fashion Trade-off:** Trendy styles at accessible prices
- **Shopping Experience:** Frequent visits rewarded with new products

### Question 2: Inventory Decision Making
**Prompt:** Assuming long lead times, how would a buyer at the Gap make inventory ordering decisions? How do buyers make the same decision for Zara?

**Gap's Approach (Traditional):**
- **Forecast-Based:** Predict entire season demand
- **Large Commitments:** Order full quantities upfront
- **Limited Flexibility:** Cannot adjust to actual demand
- **High Risk:** Large losses if forecast wrong

**Zara's Approach (Responsive):**
- **Test and Learn:** Start with small quantities
- **Real-Time Adjustment:** Scale based on actual sales
- **Multiple Bets:** Many designs, few winners
- **Risk Mitigation:** Smaller losses per failure

### Question 3: Business Model Benefits
**Prompt:** What are the relative benefits of Inditex/Zara's business models?

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Reduced Inventory Risk:** Lower obsolescence costs

- **Overall Risk:** Reduced through diversification

## Strategic Framework Analysis

### Postponement Strategy
- **Design Postponement:** Delay final style decisions
- **Production Postponement:** Delay manufacturing until demand clarity
