1\. \["Moderation in all things' is ill-considered advice. Rather, we should say, 'Moderation in most things,' since many areas of human concern require or at least profit from extreme focus."\]

the speaker asserts that moderation should be applied for most things rather than all things.

Admittedely, when it comes to enjoying pleasure, moderation is imperative virtue.

On the other hand, when it comes to pursuing competitive goals, perfection is more valuable than moderation.

What is important, when we perform indecisive duties, perfection is indispensible quality rather than moderation

In sum, surely moderation is indispensible in some respect, but in other cases, perfection rather than moderation is more valuable.

2\. \[‘The absence of choice is a circumstance that is very, very few’\]

Some people may face difficulties in choosing a right one with a list of choices in every moment of their lives.

Let’s consider person someone, who is named ‘Bad Luck’, a poor child, is born at a destitue family in a deserted region.

As shown above, I cannot agree with the speaker's assertion that the absence of choice is a circumstance that is very rare.

3.\["There are two kinds of laws: just and unjust. Every citizen in a society has a responsibility to follow just laws and, even more essentially, to disobey and protest unjust laws."\]

The speaker asserts that just laws should be obeyed without doubt, and at the same time unjust laws must be phase out. I also agree the speaker's assertion because although it depends on the situation whether unjust laws should be disobeyed or not, many cases people disobeying and resistance have brought mankind to see the present day society.

Admittedely, it is difficult to distinguish between just and unjust since in many cases there are no absolute standards to be able to classify such category.

Next, since laws play a crucial role to keep out society in order, it is every indiviual's obligation to inspite of being against.

Although it is responsibility of the citizen to obey the just law, there is also the time when it is indispensible to disobey and to resist unjust laws to every citizens who wishes to see the peaceful and healthy soceity.

In sum, I admit that the law whether it is just or unjust plays a vital role in keeping the stability of the society; it is certain that there are times when laws need to be amended. When people feel that their rights are not being protected and even undermined, it is their freedom and responsibility to propound and express it through resisting and disobeying the unjust.

4.\[To be a successful leader, a public politician must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.\]

The speaker asserts that a public official should equip himself with the highest ethical and moral standards for successful leadership.  
I strongly agree with the speaker's state that an excellant leader should be well qualified as a man of virtue.  
Moral hazards among public officials inevitably bring calamities not only upon themselves but also upon the whole society.  
In sum, history manifests itself how significant the highest ethical and moral standards is, if public officials seek to be effective leaders.

Although it is widely accepted that the best quality of the leadership is an administrative competence, such executive excellence without strict ethical basis would consequently fail to achieve authentic leadership. History teaches us that political leaders who lack morality invited a disaster on the world. 예1 Hitler, Stalin + 예2 Osama bin Laden  
Thus, high standard of morality should be the prerequisite for successful leadership.

In contrast, history also shows us the opposite exempler leaders who maintained highest ethical and moral standards as an excellent leader. 예1 Socrates, Confucius + 예2 Gandi, Martin Luther, Mandela, Aung San  
Therefore, the highest standards of ethics and morality should be the cornerstone of effective leadership.

In sum, history manifests itself how significant the highest ethical and moral standards is, if public officials seek to be effective leaders. When every public official realizes that sincere leadership comes from the high integrity, out society will take an advanced step forward.

5.\[People can usually learn much more from those who have similar views than from those who have contradictive views.\]

Some people say that our different views hinder learning rather than promote or advance it, since disagreement cause us to feel stress.  
In some cases, I admit that disagreement would prevent us from learning more, if two arguers do not open mind to each other.  
In my view, however, the assertion fails to take into accounts benefits that different views can bring to us.

Admittedly, when two arguers have basically different interests, especially when they are in position that they have no open mind to each other, they learn little from each other.

Moreover, even contradictory views help us to supplement our insufficient thoughts.

In conclusion, even though basically different interests sometimes prevent us from learning,if we have open minds to each other, the contradictory views would often enable us to improve our inadequate knowledge. Moreover, history teaches us that the theories different, contradictive to existing thoughts, in many cases, have contributed to enlarging our insufficient knowledge and even to developing our civilization.

6.\["An individual's greatness cannot be judged objectively by his or her contemporaries; the most objective evaluators of a person's greatness are people who belong to a later time."\]

The speaker asserts that the most objective evaluators of individual are descendents of a later time.  
Although I concede that they are more proper evaluators in evaluating scientists and politicians, I also believe that prominent geniuses have been fairly evaluated by their contemporaries.  
It is scientist's contemporaries that do not have to judge the value of scientific achivement due to their biased knowledge.

It is politicians' power and many involved people that make it difficult to objectively evaluate politician's greatness.

However, there are talented geniuses who are evaluated being great at their time.

In sum, although it is difficult to objectively judge scientists or politicians because of lack of knowledge or politicians' influence respectively, I can find that in certain cases outstanding geniuses are objectively judged as being great in their time due to their great abilities.  
Thus, I think that the speaker’s assertion needs some revising to accommodate wider opinions.

7\. \[Most important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seek ing the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.\]

I admit that many accidental discoveries and creations have made the significant contribution to the human civilization.  
However, although many discoveries and creations seem to be accidental, many of which are actually originated from continuous and incessant endeavors.

Admittedly, we can find that many outstanding discoveries have been achieved on the way of seeking other goals.

However, many researches require continuous, time-consuming processing before reaching important consequences.

In conclusion, in human civilization, a variety of discoveries or creations were brought about by chance and sometimes we even obtain the answer of a problem when seeking another.  
However, from a macroscopic and objective perspective, we must have it in our mind that most significant discoveries and creations in human history should be attributed to toil and sweats.  
The proverb “Rome was not built in one day” enables me to ascribe such unexpected discoveries to the long-term endeavor of generations.
