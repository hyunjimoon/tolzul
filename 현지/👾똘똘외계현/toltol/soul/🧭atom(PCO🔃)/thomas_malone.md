> After sharing my slide above which maps roles of diagnostics with orchestrate's definition (:=arrange elements of situation to surreptitiously produce desired effect), Andrew Gelman shared his [article (delivering data differently)](https://streaklinks.com/BmKMuhJ19YUCxJEGGgDvM4og/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.columbia.edu%2F~gelman%2Fresearch%2Funpublished%2Fdelivering_data_differently.pdf) that describes sensification, statistical graphics, visualization, vivification. I'm curious about tools that I can use (from today!) that aid collaboration based on sensory diagnostics. For one, Charlie (cc-ed) and I are starting a blog for operations and innovation management. A collaboration tool that combines [interactive](https://streaklinks.com/BmKMuhJ6uo9_IIxN-wgHVjl7/https%3A%2F%2Famoon.world%2Fdef%28amoon%29) [graph of my research blog](https://streaklinks.com/BmKMuhJmpsGbSZZGUw0aS4sg/https%3A%2F%2Famoon.world%2Fdef%28amoon%29) with generative AI, can perhaps recommend what topics to write about. e.g. (haven’t been covered or expressed as “future work”) && (trending or important). 

semantic space (embedding), links between the (get text from the document; ); adding time as explicit dimension; high dimensional representation of content (point 100-500 dim space, play through space, time dimension; fast forward and reverse - visually see trends) - supervised learning (take relatively high dims of document and word, ml to represent in mini fewer dimension - enough dimension; put time axis on yourself (here's an image (8/1, 9/13) compress into lower dim; video) ) - gpt (embedding), postdocs (steven rick)

> data -> parameter estimation -> decision, as attached (dyn_dec.png), is canonical workflow. However, decisions should be fed into data for further data collection and decision. In the Human in the loop system, plots and interactive/counterfactual graphs play this role, but are you aware of a more formal way of measuring this information from decision to data? Some analytical approaches do optimization together after combining estimation and decision steps. This makes the map between data and decision more reversible, allowing decision sensitivity calculation easier. However, mathematical assumptions are too strong and less human-centric so I wish to learn more computation and tool-based ways to do this.

Information pooling structure of hierarchical Bayesian mesmerizes me so I'm most interested in your first supermind (hierarchy) among the several ( , and communities). That being said, your comment that the "ecosystem is unlike the other four superminds as it's mostly competition-based, survival of the fittest" interests me. In the open-source community I was in, the ecosystem was used in a less competitive way (e.g. [Stan ecosystem metric](https://streaklinks.com/BmKMuhN5ednT-Ss6zwDBq-ms/https%3A%2F%2Fdiscourse.mc-stan.org%2Ft%2Fstan-ecosystem-metrics%2F18531)) so I wish to have a deeper understanding on collaborate and compete with your help.  
3.1 can we view prey-predator dynamics as either competitive or collaborative? Does predator prevent prey from self-destructing?  
3.2 following pairs competitive or collaborative?
> - Machine learning open source in different languages (e.g.neural net / Bayesian computation in Python and R)
> - LLM product (GPT-3.5, LLama) 
> - LLM company (OpenAI, Meta)
> - AR glass product (Vision Pro, Quest)
> - AR glass producer (Apple, Meta) 
> - all of the above collaborate to fasten technological advances; make behavioral responses to the metaverse and digital twin positive.

decision makers attempt optimize (dynamic programming); don't know what your goals are; negotiation process

ecosystem (set of collaborative player, somewhat biologist, resources synergistic, ultimately competition, rule), it can have cooperation, some amount of cooperation (democracy (deciding by vote;outvote C), market (individual buyer and seller), add all those up (police arrests), boss makes the decision (if you violate those understandings), communities (soft)

- mapping with [[jinhua_zhao]]'s norm (community, culture), law (hierarchy, chosen by democracy, physical), price (market);

- Thomas changed his thoughts during the meeting ("i wouldn't have said this before") that ultimate goal and intention matter. I used the [romance of the three kingdoms (a,b,c) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms)tale where a and b temporarily collaborate to fight against c but their ultimate goal is not collaboration itself, but to be the sole conqueror of China
- likewise, in prey-predator dynamic, predator contribute to increasing prey's death rate but predator had no intention of helping preys extinct from overpopulation
