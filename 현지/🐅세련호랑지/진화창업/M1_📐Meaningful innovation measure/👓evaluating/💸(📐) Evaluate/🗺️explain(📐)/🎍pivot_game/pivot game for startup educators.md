I prepared a video on feature and startup's usecase of my tool, `pivot game`. Input on any of the five questions, especially from my beachhead, startup educators, would help me improve this game.

- QD: how much do you need this pivot simulator? 
  this depends on the clockspeed of the domain educator is in. clockspeed is largely determined by organization rigidity, technology/innovation push, product's bit and atom ratio, customer pull, system complexity, branding, and regulation. domain with slower clockspeed will place higher premium on my simulator as they will be more discrete in making a pivot move. Usually deeptech has closer clockspeed and my assumption is clockspeed will increase in order of engine < designX < martin trust center. Hence scenario analysis with be more desired. My plan on theory side is to bridge Charlie's clockspeed (Fine, 2000) with Scott's appropriability (Gans and Stern, 2017) during summer, with prompting [here](https://claude.ai/chat/89427b01-cadf-4251-b824-4d8dd758d4c2)
### <font color  = "green"> improving technical feasibility </font>
- QT1: realistic decision rule
  how can decision rule (e.g. pivot market if observed (proxy for) profit is lower than low bar, pivot product if observed profit is between low and high bar) be improved to make more sense?
- QT2: gamify
  how can current form of simulation be wrapped into a game e.g. [street fighter 6](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/en-us) which allows game player to choose environment, opponent, one's strength and weakness
- QT3: intuitive plots
  how can the two plots (belief by time and component, belief by time and space) be made more intuitive and be users friendly (you and your students)?
### <font color  = "red">improving operational feasibility </font>
- QO1: classroom usecase
  what additional features would help you use this game to train your students on pivot in your classroom?
