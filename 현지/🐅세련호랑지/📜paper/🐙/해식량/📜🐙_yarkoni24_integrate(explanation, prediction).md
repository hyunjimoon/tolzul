| 1. Introduction                       | Why is there tension between explanation and prediction in computational social science?    | ‚Ä¢ Traditional social science prioritizes explanations (Hedstr√∂m & Ylikoski, 2010)<br>‚Ä¢ Computer science prioritizes predictions (Breiman, 2001)<br>‚Ä¢ Critiques of both approaches: replication issues, bias, generalizability | The epistemic values of social and computer scientists can be reconciled by integrating explanation and prediction rather than treating them as competing objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Fig 1: None (conceptual section)                                                                                                  |
| 2. Prediction vs Explanation          | How are prediction and explanation commonly confused in practice?                           | ‚Ä¢ Null hypothesis significance testing literature (NHST)<br>‚Ä¢ Research on replication crisis (Simmons et al., 2011)<br>‚Ä¢ Predictive modeling literature                                                                       | Current research practices often conflate prediction and explanation:<br>‚Ä¢ NHST is used to test theories but often only shows effects aren't zero<br>‚Ä¢ Predictive models generate correlations mistaken for causation<br>‚Ä¢ Different evaluation choices lead to drastically different conclusions                                                                                               | Fig 2: None (conceptual section)                                                                                                  |
| 3. Framework for Integrative Modeling | How can we organize empirical modeling approaches to clarify their focus?                   | ‚Ä¢ Descriptive statistics literature<br>‚Ä¢ Causal inference methods<br>‚Ä¢ Machine learning literature<br>‚Ä¢ Literature on out-of-distribution generalization                                                                      | üß†üëì A 2√ó2 framework with four quadrants:<br>1. Descriptive modeling: Describes past/present<br>2. Explanatory modeling: Estimates causal effects<br>3. Predictive modeling: Forecasts outcomes in similar situations<br>4. Integrative modeling: Predicts outcomes under changes/interventions                                                                                                 | Table 1: Framework organizing empirical modeling by focus (features vs outcomes) and situation type (fixed vs changing)           |
| 4. Suggestions for Integration        | What concrete steps can researchers take to integrate explanation and prediction?           | ‚Ä¢ Research on pre-registration<br>‚Ä¢ Common task framework literature<br>‚Ä¢ Open science practices                                                                                                                              | Three recommendations:<br>1. üß≠ Integrate modeling approaches through cross-domain testing and iterative methods<br>2. üó∫Ô∏è Label research contributions by quadrant and granularity<br>3. üåè Standardize open science practices across communities                                                                                                                                              | Table 2: Label scheme for research contributions<br>Box 1: Example of how to label contributions<br>Box 2: Summary of suggestions |
| 5. Implications for Research          | What are the broader implications of integrative modeling for computational social science? | ‚Ä¢ Work on model interpretability<br>‚Ä¢ Research on epistemic modesty<br>‚Ä¢ Literature on scientific progress                                                                                                                    | Integrative modeling may require epistemic modesty but will advance work at the intersection of computational and social sciences:<br>‚Ä¢ Forcing explanations to make predictions reveals their limitations<br>‚Ä¢ Attention to explanation improves generalizability of predictive models<br>‚Ä¢ Interpretability should be valued but is logically independent of causal and predictive properties | Fig 3: None (conceptual section)                                                                                                  |
