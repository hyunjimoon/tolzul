Formulation of Dynamic Hypothesis Initial hypothesis generation: What are current theories of the problematic behavior?

Endogenous focus: Formulate a dynamic hypothesis that explains the dynamics as endogenous consequences of the feedback structure. Mapping: Develop maps of causal structure based on initial hypotheses, key variables, reference modes, and other available data, using tools such as Model boundary diagrams, Subsystem diagrams, Causal loop diagrams, Stock and flow maps, Policy structure diagrams, Other facilitation tools.

| Dynamic hypothesis                     | working theory of how the problem arose. It guides modeling efforts by focusing you and your clients on certain structures. Much of the remainder of the modeling process helps you to test the dynamic hypothesis, both with the simulation model and by experiments and data collection in the real world. |
