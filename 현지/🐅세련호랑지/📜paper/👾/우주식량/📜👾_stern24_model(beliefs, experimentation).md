- experiments might be altered by changing tested strategies alongside a fixed core idea when both are subject to uncertainty. In this case, there is a rationale for continued experimentation following some signal realisations. Specifically, they demonstrate that an experiment that tests strategies with a lower expected prior first in a sequence can provide a better signal of the underlying idea as opposed to choosing the strategy with the highest prior.
