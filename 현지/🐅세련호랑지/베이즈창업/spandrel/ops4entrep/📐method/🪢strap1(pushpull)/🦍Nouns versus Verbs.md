Prose stagnates when abstract noun‑clusters (“modernization,” “implementation”) smother action. Verbs rekindle movement; yet over‑animating prose can turn acrobatic. Seek sentences that pulse, not preen.

| A | **Anomaly (problem)** – English is turning “noun‑heavy”: nominalisations, noun‑strings and preposition‑chains smother verbs, making prose static. |  
| D | **Develops (diagnosis/remedy)** – Re‑balance the sentence’s two poles. Push energy back in with live, finite verbs; reserve big abstract nouns only where they genuinely clarify. |  
| G | **Grows (evidence/examples)** – See ledger below: Newtonian science, Kate Moss’s motto, Bishop’s black‑list, Woolf’s journal line, McPhee’s Hebridean place‑names, Bourland’s E‑Prime, etc. |  
| C | **Contribution (take‑away)** – _Maxim # 4_ in action: “The bones of a sentence are a noun and a verb.” Master the sliding scale from “nouniest noun” (nominalisation) to “verbiest verb” (finite, transitive) and you control motion. |

**Where the three maxims sit inside Ch. 3**

|Maxim|Explicit locus|
|---|---|
|**#4 noun + verb bones**|Central thesis of the chapter (see Woolf & Moss examples)|
|**#9 love the full stop**|Shown indirectly via warnings against long noun‑phrases that delay the main verb and therefore the full stop|
|**#13 vary length & music**|Section on cumulative sentences and free modifiers (Christensen) encourages rhythmic expansion/contraction|
