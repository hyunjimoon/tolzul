[[2025-07-11|25-07-11-01]], [[jeff_dotson]]'s 🟪what is the problem, ♻️why is it important/difficult, 🟧what do we do, 🔴what's different

# 🤟 Verse: The Four-Sentence Symphony

First you write a sentence—then three more, each leaning on the half-open door of the last.

🟪 **“_This paper tackles ____, a problem that ____._”**  
♻️ **“_It matters because ____, yet existing approaches ____._”**  
🟧 **“_We ____ by ____._”**  
🔴 **“_Unlike prior work, this shows ____, reshaping how we ____._”**

| 💠 Step                          | Purpose & questions to ask                                                                                                                                                | Sentence‑craft tips (from _First You Write a Sentence_)                                                                                    | Checklist before moving on                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 🟪 Problem**                 | _What puzzle or gap does the paper tackle?_ ‑ Name the phenomenon in one clear clause.‑ Hint at stakes to lure the reader onward.                                         | • Lead with a strong verb; avoid noun‑gravy.• End the line on an unresolved note (“half‑open door”) so the next sentence feels inevitable. | ✔ Unique phenomenon stated.<br><br>✔ No method jargon yet.     |
| **2 ♻️ Importance / Difficulty** | _Why does this puzzle matter, and why is it hard?_ ‑ Contrast consequences of ignoring it.‑ Acknowledge existing limits or costs.                                         | • Use **causal connectors** (“because”, “yet”) to tighten flow.• Keep the rhythm brisk—think of the sentence as a courteous gift.          | ✔ Stakes or barriers explicit.<br><br>✔ Reader senses urgency. |
| **3 🟧 What we do**              | _What decisive move does the paper make?_ ‑ State the core method, model, or experiment in one beat.‑ Pair technical noun with an action verb (“we derive…”, “we test…”). | • Place the novelty verb early (“we introduce…”).• Prune qualifiers; let one vivid image stand.                                            | ✔ Action & deliverable clear.<br><br>✔ No result claims yet.   |
| **4 🔴 What’s different**        | _How does this advance the field?_ ‑ Contrast with prior work or intuition.‑ Land on the most surprising payoff or insight.                                               | • Echo a keyword from Sentence 1 to create resonance.• End on a definitive full stop—leave no loose hinge.                                 | ✔ Contrast unmistakable.<br><br>✔ Memorable closing cadence.   |

## The Musical Writing Principle

A verse is your paper's **heartbeat** in four measures. Like a string quartet where each instrument enters at the perfect moment, your four sentences form a complete musical thought:

1. **🟪 Alert** (The Dissonance): State the surprising tension that demands resolution
2. **♻️ Dig** (The Development): Reveal why this tension matters and resists easy solution  
3. **🟧 Grow** (The Modulation): Present your method that transforms the problem
4. **🔴 Core** (The Resolution): Declare what changes when your insight takes hold

## The Consecution Rule

Each sentence must end with **a half-open door** (Moran's "Foolish Like a Trout"):
- 🟪 ends with a paradox that begs for explanation
- ♻️ ends with a gap that demands filling
- 🟧 ends with a promise that needs proof
- 🔴 ends with an insight that echoes back to 🟪, completing the Möbius loop

## The Gift Economy

Each sentence is **a gift, not a tax** (Moran's "A Small, Good Thing"):
- Maximum 30 words per sentence—respect the reader's breath
- One core verb per sentence—maintain forward momentum
- Zero redundancy between sentences—each adds new value
- Complete thought in 120 words total—leave them wanting more

## Example Verse: The Promise Vendor

> 🟪 Entrepreneurs systematically overpromise to attract resources—behavior that appears irrational yet persists across industries.  
> ♻️ This paradox matters because standard bias explanations can't explain why successful ventures emerge from apparent delusion.  
> 🟧 We model promise-making as rational choice, introducing symmetric commitment costs and a unique "matching value" for aligned stakeholder beliefs.  
> 🔴 Overpromising becomes optimal strategy when opportunity costs dominate failure costs—reframing entrepreneurial "bias" as context-appropriate rationality.

## Your Verse Template

```markdown
🟪 [Subject] does [surprising action]—[conventional view] yet [persistent reality].
♻️ This [tension/paradox] matters because [current tools fail] to explain [important phenomenon].
🟧 We [active verb] by [method], introducing [key innovation] that [transformation].
🔴 [Core insight] when [condition]—[reframing statement] as [new understanding].
```

## The Verse-Writing Ritual

1. **Write the 🔴 first**: Know your destination—what transforms?
2. **Find the 🟪**: What anomaly makes your 🔴 necessary?
3. **Bridge with ♻️**: Why can't existing thought connect 🟪 to 🔴?
4. **Build the 🟧**: How does your method span the gap?
5. **Read aloud**: Do the sentences flow like movements in music?
6. **Cut 15%**: What can you remove while preserving the melody?

Remember: A verse is not a summary—it's a **composition**. Each word earns its place through sound, sense, and sequence. The best verses make readers hear the rest of your paper before they've read it.

*Practice: Write your paper's verse in four attempts. First attempt: get the ideas down. Second: enforce the word limits. Third: polish the consecution. Fourth: ensure each sentence gifts something essential.*
