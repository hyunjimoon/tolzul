## Title: The Promise Vendor: A Rational Choice Model of Entrepreneurial Overpromise
## Abstract:
Entrepreneurial ventures often engage in "overpromising," a behavior widely viewed through the lens of cognitive bias. We challenge this view by developing a rational choice model to explain when and by how much an entrepreneur should promise before securing the resources to deliver. We extend the classic newsvendor model in two fundamental ways: (1) we define time-symmetric underage and overage costs (Cu, Co) for decisions made under two-sided commitment uncertainty (from both customers and resource partners); and (2) we introduce a "matching value" (V), representing the unique prize of successfully aligning these commitments.
Our model yields a closed-form solution for the optimal promise level (q*), demonstrating that overpromising is a rational strategy when the opportunity cost of a missed sale (Cu) is high relative to the cost of a broken promise (Co). Counter-intuitively, our analysis reveals that the matching value (V) acts as a strategic moderator, not a simple accelerant of ambition. For ventures facing high opportunity costs (Cu > Co), a larger prize (V) dampens the tendency to overpromise, enforcing discipline. Conversely, for ventures facing high failure costs (Co > Cu), V provides the necessary incentive to undertake calculated risks.
Theoretically, we contribute a unified framework that reframes apparent entrepreneurial bias as a predictable output of a firm's strategic context. Managerially, we introduce the duality of the proactive "Promise Vendor," who acts to shape the future, and the reactive "News Vendor," who optimizes based on the past. This distinction provides a formal language for allocating resources between opportunity creation and operational efficiency.

|**1**|**1. A-Theme (Exposition)**|A → A12 → [A1, A2]|**The Problem (Alert):** We introduce the puzzle of overpromise (A). This tension is amplified (A12) by the two-sided nature of promises (`Pc`, `Pr`) (A1) and the lure of a unique matching value `V` (A2).|
|**2**||[A1, A2] → D12|**The Need (Dig):** The complexities of `Pc`, `Pr`, and `V` (A1, A2) demand an integrated model (D12) that can handle this new form of uncertainty.|

|**7**||[G1, G2] ← D12|**Meeting the Need:** We demonstrate explicitly how our model's components (G1, G2) perfectly fulfill the diagnostic requirements for a new theory (D12).|

|**9**||C12 ← A|**Closing the Loop (The Möbius Twist):** Our framework (C12) resolves the initial anomaly (A). However, by making the logic of promising explicit, it creates a new, more advanced problem: how do strategic actors behave when they _know_ this model governs their counterparts' decisions? The solution (C) generates the next research anomaly (A').|

### 1. How `V` Fundamentally Alters the `Cu` vs. `Co` Balance

The classic Newsvendor model balances two costs: the cost of being short (`Cu`) and the cost of being over (`Co`). The optimal decision is driven by the critical ratio `Cu / (Cu + Co)`, which represents a trade-off. It's a cost-minimization game.

Your Promise Vendor model introduces the matching value `V`, which is not a cost to be minimized but a **potential prize to be won**. This fundamentally alters the decision-making logic in two ways:

- **From Cost Avoidance to Prize Seeking:** The entrepreneur is no longer just balancing two negative outcomes. They are balancing two negatives (`Cu`, `Co`) against a significant positive (`V`). This `V` acts as a powerful incentive—a "pull" towards making the match happen. It shifts the mindset from purely reactive cost management to proactive opportunity creation.
- **Altering the Mathematical Ratio:** The prize `V` is added to _both_ the numerator and the denominator in the core logic: `(2Cu + V) / (2Co + V)`. This means `V` doesn't just add a simple bonus; it changes the _sensitivity_ of the decision. It reframes the importance of the original costs. A large `V` can make a small difference between `Cu` and `Co` seem less significant, focusing the entrepreneur on the grand prize instead of the marginal costs.

### 2. The Surprising Role of the Matching Value `V`

You are absolutely correct. My previous statement was an oversimplification. The effect of an increasing `V` on the optimal promise level `q*` is not straightforward; it depends entirely on the underlying relationship between `Cu` and `Co`.

Let's analyze the ratio `R = (2Cu + V) / (2Co + V)`. The optimal promise `q*` increases if this ratio increases. The derivative of `R` with respect to `V` is `(2Co - 2Cu) / (2Co + V)^2`.

This leads to a much more nuanced and powerful insight:

- **Case 1: `Cu > Co` (High Opportunity Cost):** In this classic "overpromise" scenario, the term `(2Co - 2Cu)` is negative. This means that as the prize `V` gets larger, the ratio `R` actually _decreases_. A massive potential prize **dampens the tendency to overpromise**. It introduces a sense of gravity, making the entrepreneur _more_ disciplined because the stakes of getting it right are so high. The prize doesn't encourage wild promises; it encourages making the _right_ promise.
- **Case 2: `Co > Cu` (High Failure Cost):** In this "underpromise" scenario, `(2Co - 2Cu)` is positive. As the prize `V` gets larger, the ratio `R` _increases_. Here, a large prize **encourages more risk-taking**. It provides the incentive needed to overcome the fear of the high failure cost (`Co`) and reach for a valuable opportunity that would otherwise be ignored.

This is a fantastic, non-obvious result and a core part of your paper's contribution. `V` is not a simple accelerator; it is a **strategic moderator** whose effect depends on the context.

### 3. The "New Lens" of Proactive vs. Reactive Strategy

The duality between the Promise Vendor (proactive) and the News Vendor (reactive) provides a new lens by giving managers a formal language to describe and quantify a fundamental strategic tension.

- **Reactive (News Vendor Lens):** Views the world as a set of historical data and probabilities. The goal is to optimize operations to _react_ to a predicted future. Strategy is about **efficiency, forecasting, and adaptation**.
- **Proactive (Promise Vendor Lens):** Views the world as a set of stakeholders (customers, partners) who can be enrolled to _create_ a desired future. The goal is to make commitments that shape the environment. Strategy is about **vision, persuasion, and co-creation**.

**Implications of this "New Lens":**

1. **Resource Allocation:** It helps a CEO decide whether the next dollar should be spent on hiring a data scientist (a reactive, News Vendor investment) or a business development lead (a proactive, Promise Vendor investment).
2. **Valuing Intangibles:** It allows the firm to formally incorporate the value of narrative, vision, and stakeholder commitments (`V`) into its capital allocation models, justifying investments that traditional ROI models might reject.
3. **Dynamic Strategy:** It suggests that the optimal strategic posture is not static. An early-stage venture might be 90% proactive. After finding product-market fit, it might shift to 60% reactive to scale efficiently. Your model provides the `q*` metric to track and guide this evolution.

### 4. Explicitly Stating the Two Innovations (with Examples)

Here is a clear breakdown of the two core innovations, as requested.

**Innovation 1: Cost Definitions with Time Gap**

The model re-frames the classic newsvendor costs for a world where decisions are made _before_ capacity is fully secured.

- **Underage Cost (`Cu`):** The opportunity cost of caution. It is the "cost to the organization when a promise, which _would have been_ deliverable by time t, is not sold at time 0." This represents a missed match—a customer you could have served but didn't dare to promise.
- **Overage Cost (`Co`):** The failure cost of ambition. It is the "cost to the organization when a promise sold at time 0 is _not_ deliverable by time t." This represents a broken promise—a customer you committed to but failed to serve.

**Innovation 2: Defining Optimal Promise Regimes**

Your model predicts when different promise strategies are rational.

- **Overpromise is Optimal (`q* > 0` when `Cu > Co`):**
    
    - **Example 1 (Market Seizure):** A startup launching a revolutionary AI service. The `Cu` is immense: losing a key anchor client like Google or Netflix to a competitor means forfeiting market leadership. The `Co` (failing to deliver on the promised timeline) is a manageable cost (refunds, reputational hit) compared to the existential threat of being second-to-market.
    - **Example 2 (Network Effects):** A platform business (e.g., a new marketplace) needs to build a critical mass of users. `Cu` is the failure to achieve the network effect, rendering the entire platform worthless. `Co` is the cost of disappointing some early adopters, which is a smaller price to pay for a chance at creating a billion-dollar ecosystem.
- **Underpromise is Optimal (`q* < 0` when `Co > Cu`):**
    
    - **Example (High-Stakes Reliability):** A company supplying critical components for a SpaceX rocket launch. The `Co` of failure is catastrophic: mission failure, loss of life, and the end of the company. The `Cu` of not winning the contract is merely a lost sale. The rational strategy is to promise only what can be delivered with near-absolute certainty.
- **Balanced/Moderated Promise is Optimal (when `V` is Predominant):**
    
    - **Example (Transformative Projects):** A consortium bidding to build a city's first high-speed rail system. The matching value `V` (economic transformation, political legacy) is colossal. Both `Cu` (losing the bid to a rival city) and `Co` (a failed, multi-billion-dollar public works project) are also enormous. Here, the sheer magnitude of `V` forces extreme diligence. It moderates the decision away from a simple `Cu` vs. `Co` gamble, pushing the promise level (`q*`) towards a highly calibrated, carefully calculated optimum. The goal is no longer just to win, but to ensure the valuable match is successfully realized.
