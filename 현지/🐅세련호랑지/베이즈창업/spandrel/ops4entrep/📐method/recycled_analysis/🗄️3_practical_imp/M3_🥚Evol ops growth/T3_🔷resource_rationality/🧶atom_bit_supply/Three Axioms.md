👁 🟠 Axiom 1
> Iterative simulation, as combination of initial value and updating scheme on product space (<span style="color:green">Omega</span> $\times$ <span style="color:red"> t</span>), transform intractable spatial process into tractable space–time process

🧠🌲 Axiom 2
> all simulations can be represented as a hierarchical structure; hierarchize (= merge, diverge) as operators

🏭, ⌛️<->⏳ Axiom 3
> Time reversal is possible in simulation. i.e. <span style="color:green">Time</span> in reality but <span style="color:red">Time</span> in simulation. ([[Consistency]])
