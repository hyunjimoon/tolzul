Computational thinking 
- recursively, parallel processing
- interpreting code as data and data as code. 
- type checking as the generalization of dimensional analysis
- recognizing both the virtues and the dangers of aliasing
- recognizing both the cost and power of indirect addressing and procedure call.
- It is judging a program not just for correctness and efficiency but for aesthetics, and a system’s design for simplicity and elegance. 
- Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task or designing a large complex system. It is 
- separation of concerns
- choosing an appropriate representation for a problem or modeling the relevant aspects of a problem to make it tractable
- using invariants to describe a system’s behavior succinctly and declaratively. It is having the confidence we can safely use, modify, and influence a large complex L system without understanding its every detail. It is
- complex system - abstraction, decomposition
- using invariants to describe a system’s behavior succinctly and declaratively
- modularizing, in anticipation of multiple users or prefetching and caching
- prevention, protection, recovery from worst-case scenarios through redundancy, damage containment, error correction

Can we build systems with simple designs, that are easy to understand, modify, and maintain, yet provide the rich complexity in functionality of systems that we enjoy today?
