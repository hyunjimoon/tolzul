question list: 
- is there any notion of exchangability (disruptor vs value chain for rapidsos)


which abstract is better?

While existing innovation literature has primarily focused on adaptation through modification or abandonment of existing options, we demonstrate that many breakthrough innovations emerge through distinct processes of option creation. Through a Bayesian lens, we introduce two novel creation architectures beyond traditional adaptation: co-opted adaptation, which repurposes existing functions for new domains, and co-opted nonaption, which transforms structural constraints into new functional opportunities. Our key insight is that entropy helps measure how what initially appears as a constraint can transform into a source of new functions. In vehicle manufacturing, for example, safety requirements that initially constrained battery design ultimately led to breakthrough innovations in battery architecture. This transformation process generates observable patterns that can be measured through entropy. While de Finetti's exchangeability framework helps us reason about the space of possible functions, entropy provides a way to measure how actual functions emerge from constraints. Our hierarchical Bayesian framework combines these approaches: exchangeability helps structure the space of possibilities, while entropy tracks how constraints transform into functions.Through mobility sector case studies, we demonstrate how these creation architectures differ from traditional adaptation in both process and outcome. Co-opted adaptation enables rapid scaling through functional transfer across domains, while co-opted nonaption reveals how structural constraints themselves become sources of innovation. Our framework helps resource-constrained companies move beyond simple adaptation to achieve more transformative innovation outcomes while opening new research directions in understanding option creation mechanisms.

where i am? 
1. shared vision: test2choose1(🧠bayesian, 🌳⛰️evolutionary entrepreneurship)
2. Ieap of faith: test2choose1 = exchangeability (de-Finetti) 
3. transitioned to focusing mode, per CVS ❤️'s consensus
4. _🤜Moving with Bayes Lens👓_ to complex adaptive system conference (due 12/20) with charlie and evolutionary psychologist ✔️

---
plan for today
1. need feedback on framing 💡innovation conjecture from policy perspective (stopping time)
2. how to "extract" 🧠priors to 🤜act, from observations without knowing intentions (nature's evolutionary pattern, case studies)
3. 1,2, helps me frame how to operationalize non-adaptive evolutionary pattern _🤜Moving with Bayes Lens👓_ 
4. 3 helps us bridge 🧠bayesian and 🌳⛰️evolutionary entrepreneurship ✔️
  (5. de Finetti's theorem [exchangeable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_random_variables "Exchangeable random variables") observations are [conditionally independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditionally_independent "Conditionally independent") relative to some [latent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable "Latent variable"))
