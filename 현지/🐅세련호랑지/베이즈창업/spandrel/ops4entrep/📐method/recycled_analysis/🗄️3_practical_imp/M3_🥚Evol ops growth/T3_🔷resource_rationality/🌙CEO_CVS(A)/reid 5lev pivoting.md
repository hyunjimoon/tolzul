| The Shift   | Constant adjustment to changes in technology, market, or world while maintaining the original vision. Pivoting this way often leads to more success because it's guided by the vision. | Ev Williams' progression from Blogger to Odeo to Twitter - each pivot maintained his core vision of connecting people's ideas through technology.                                           |
| The Switch  | Strategic change within an existing business that requires early feedback and communication with stakeholders before implementation.                                                   | TaskRabbit's shift from an open bidding system to a structured categorization system with fixed rates - required communicating changes to their tasker community.                           |
| The Swerve  | Reaction to an unexpected development - either a problem blocking progress or a new opportunity appearing suddenly that requires investigation.                                        | Nextdoor's pivot during COVID-19 to create the Help Map feature and COVID-19 Help Center in response to community needs during the pandemic.                                                |
| The Reboot  | Complete departure from the original company mission.

| The Rebound | Pivoting in response to a crisis, which while challenging, can offer opportunities to learn, experiment and improve the business for long-term strength.                               | Airbnb's pivot during COVID-19 from short-term travel stays to long-term rentals and virtual experiences, adapting their business model to the crisis while maintaining their core mission. |




REID'S THEORIES ON EMBRACING PLAN B

The shift: Even the most focused entrepreneurs to pursuing a particular vision must constantly shift and adjust to changes in tech, market, world. Pivoting in this way doesn't mean giving up on the vision: in fact, they are often more successful pivoting because they're guided by a vision.

The switch: strategy switch - get early feedback on changes like this or at least communicate those changes to as many of your stakeholders as you can before you flip the switch.

The swerve: reactions to an unexpected development: a new problem or opportunity that suddenly manifests itself. It might be blocking the path forward, requiring a deft sideways maneuver to avoid a crash, or it could be something compelling that has cropped up on the side of the road. You may find it's worth swerving to investigate and perhaps pursue this new possibility.

The reboot: complete departure from the original mission of the company. A total reboot like that can work, but it rarely goes off without some bumps.

The rebound: Pivoting in a crisis; Crises can cause some unwelcome pivots. But they also can offer opportunities to learn, experiment, and make improvements to your our cent business. So, even while navigating a crisis, look toward the future one ask questions like Within these constraints, what are the newer. and alive possibilities? How can we make our business more flexible and stronger, over the long run?"

Let me reclassify thinking about the two-coins vs urn analogy:

ü¶ÖCo-opted adaptation (Two Coins Pattern):
1. The shift - Like having two coins where vision is Coin A and new opportunities are Coin B:
- P(vision‚ÇÅ, vision‚ÇÇ, opportunity‚ÇÅ) = P(vision‚ÇÅ, opportunity‚ÇÅ, vision‚ÇÇ)
- Each still informs the other while maintaining distinct functions
- Success rate of vision helps predict success in new opportunities

2. The rebound - Crisis response shows partial exchangeability:
- Core business (Coin A) and crisis adaptations (Coin B) remain linked
- P(core‚ÇÅ, core‚ÇÇ, crisis‚ÇÅ) = P(core‚ÇÅ, crisis‚ÇÅ, core‚ÇÇ)
- Learning from crisis informs core business and vice versa

üê†Co-opted nonaption (Urn Pattern):
3. The swerve - Like drawing balls from an urn:
- P(element‚ÇÅ, element‚ÇÇ, element‚ÇÉ) = P(element‚ÇÉ, element‚ÇÅ, element‚ÇÇ)
- Unexpected opportunities can be combined in any order
- No predetermined relationship between elements
- Value emerges from combinations themselves

Neither Pattern:
4. The switch - More tactical than either pattern, closer to direct adaptation
- Doesn't show clear exchangeability patterns
- More about sequential optimization

5. The reboot - Breaks exchangeability entirely:
- Abandons both function and element relationships
- P(old) ‚Üí P(new) with no maintained connection
