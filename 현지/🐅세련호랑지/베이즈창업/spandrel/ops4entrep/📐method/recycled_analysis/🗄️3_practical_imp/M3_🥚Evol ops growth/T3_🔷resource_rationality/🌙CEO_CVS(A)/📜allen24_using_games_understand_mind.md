|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Introduction|Why can games enhance our understanding of cognition beyond traditional laboratory experiments?|• Traditional experiments with controlled, simple paradigms (Newell et al., 1972)<br>• Board game psychology research (Gobet et al., 2004)<br>• Work on game popularity across cultures (Suchow et al., 2020)|🌏Games provide two key advantages for cognitive research:<br>• 🧭Being intuitive: Reveal inductive biases in complex ecological settings<br>• 🧍‍♀️Being fun: Enable study of intrinsic motivation and attract diverse participants|No specific figure but conceptually illustrated by comparing laboratory vs. game-based tasks in Fig. 1|
|2. Games as Intuitive, Engineered Environments|How do games reveal the inductive biases that support complex behavior?|• Research on relational inductive biases (Gentner, 1983)<br>• Object perception studies (Spelke et al., 1992)<br>• Work on planning in complex spaces|🧠Games allow study of complex state/action spaces beyond traditional experiments:<br>• State spaces: From few discrete states to near-infinite pixel spaces<br>• Action spaces: From 2-4 choices to thousands of possibilities<br>• Planning depth: From 1-4 steps to dozens of sequential actions|• Virtual Tools game: 3×600×600 action space (Allen et al., 2020)<br>• Atari games: 256×256 pixel states (Dubey et al., 2018)<br>• Four-in-a-row game: 1.2 million players' planning data (van Opheusden et al., 2023)<br>• OverCooked: Multi-agent coordination (Wu et al., 2021)|
|3. Games as Enjoyable Tasks|What unique research questions emerge when tasks are intrinsically motivating?|• Literature on participant motivation (Jun et al., 2017)<br>• Research on curiosity and exploration (Chu & Schulz, 2020)<br>• Work on intrinsic vs. extrinsic rewards (Murayama, 2022)|👓Games enable research on otherwise difficult-to-study phenomena:<br>• Exploration without explicit goals<br>• Intrinsic motivation<br>• Sustained engagement over time<br>• Skill acquisition and expertise development|• Little Alchemy 2: Intrinsic exploration (Brändle et al., 2023)<br>• Sea Hero Quest: 4 million participants across 195 countries (Coutrot et al., 2018)<br>• SkillLab: Better performance with intrinsic motivation (Pedersen et al., 2023)<br>• Axon: Learning trajectories over time (Stafford & Dewar, 2014)|
|4. Potential Pitfalls of Games|What challenges arise when using games for psychological research?|• Work on experimental control<br>• Research on confounding variables<br>• Literature on participant selection bias|🗺️Two main categories of challenges:<br>• Experimental design: Less control over presentation, prior experience variations<br>• Data collection/analysis: Difficulty obtaining data, complexity of modeling, risk of ad-hoc measures|No specific figures but systematic analysis of limitations with validation approaches: using complementary games or creating custom games with experimental control|
|5. How to Use Games as Research|What practical strategies maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks of game-based research?|• Work on game development tools<br>• Citizen science methodologies (Silvertown, 2010)<br>• Computational modeling approaches|🧍‍♀️Recommended approach:<br>• Start with clear hypotheses<br>• Choose between existing games vs. creating new ones<br>• Consider recruitment strategies for target populations<br>• Use appropriate data analysis techniques<br>• Combine games with controlled experiments when possible|• Decision flowchart for using games (Fig. 2)<br>• Comparison of games vs. experimental approaches (Fig. 3)<br>• Table 1: Examples of psychological effects studied through games|
|6. Future Questions for Games Research|What new research domains can benefit from game-based approaches?|• Motivation research<br>• Holistic cognition studies<br>• Neuroscience methods<br>• Comparative cognition|🤜Games offer exciting possibilities for novel research domains:<br>• Self-directed goal setting in open-ended environments<br>• Holistic cognition studying multiple systems simultaneously<br>• Neuroscience with more naturalistic tasks<br>• Comparative studies across species|• Examples of intrinsic motivation in Minecraft<br>• Multi-system cognitive demands in The Legend of Zelda<br>• Intracranial recordings during gameplay<br>• Pac-Man studies with primates (Yang et al., 2022)|
