We can't pedict individual outcomes of the coin, but we were able to come up with a model that tries to explain the outcome generating process. The uncertainty that was present in the coin itself, was relocated into uncertainty that's now present in the value of a parameter. The latter form of uncertainty, uncertainty that's present about some incomplete knowledge about a well-defined model(process), is called *aleatoric uncertainty*. And from the coin example, this uncertainty can be overcome with sufficient amount data.

Like a coin, there are two sides of uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty that can't be overcome, bar a god. To create a model is to create a smaller, well-understood replica that correctly "moves" the epistemic uncertainty to aleatoric uncertainty about parameters(information) in the replica.
