CAPITALIZATION

For most start-ups capital investment is critical. A great deal of attention is typically paid to how start-ups can attract and negotiate for initial capital investment.

Capital requirements for scaling can vary very widely, depending on the nature of the business.

A software company offering a B2C app, for example, will need to pay for engineers, programmers, marketing, product managers, and cloud services, but requires little in terms of facilities, equipment, or any other capital equipment.

However, the capital requirements for scaling in manufacturing, for example, to support factories, warehouses, personnel, and infrastructure - sometimes across multiple global locations - will often dwarf what was needed for the initial start-up, depending on the business.

In such cases, founders are often faced with the dilemma (Noam Wasserman, 2013) of needing to give up significant control if they want access to the necessary capital to exploit growth opportunities

Software entrepreneurs (at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, for example), not needing nearly as much capital, may be able to retain significantly more ownership and control than those in heavy manufacturing.

Choosing the right investor is critical. Ash Patel of Morado Ventures believes that good and experienced investors should be able to catalyze growth by making warm introductions for a start-up, as well as by passing on learnings from previous companies. In Patel's words, "If your investors can't help in this way, they're the wrong investors! ... When you choose your board, you choose your boss...Don't pick a firm, pick an individual... Just as there has to be chemistry between founders, there must be chemistry between founders and investors. (During the SVC2UK CEO Summit, 2013)
