Unlike coffee, where modeling assumption of discrete market validation (good vs. bad) is acceptable, electric vehicle (EV) adoption depends on continuous trade-offs in market demand (**φ**) and implementation effectiveness (**θ**). A car manufacturer like Tesla or Toyota must decide whether to validate demand for EVs before committing to large-scale production. Idea validation (**c_φ**) may involve prototype testing or consumer surveys to estimate willingness to pay, while an **implemented idea test** (**c_φθ**) includes pilot production or limited regional releases. The **realized profitability (y)** is a continuous measure, reflecting financial success based on **φ** (consumer demand) and **θ** (production scalability).

Because profitability outcomes are no longer binary but instead vary across a range of values, a **computational approach becomes essential** for modeling realistic decision-making. A **Normal-Beta model** generalizes implementation effectiveness (**a_θ, b_θ**) across multiple scenarios, requiring Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulations to track how **beliefs evolve with each market observation**. Unlike in the coffee example, where discrete testing suffices, **EV adoption involves dynamic adjustments**, such as pricing strategies, technological advancements, and policy shifts. Capturing these **complex interactions necessitates computational modeling**, making a normal distribution a more suitable framework for decision-making.

While coffee quality perception is often discrete (good vs. bad), decision-making in industries like electric vehicles involves continuous trade-offs, such as battery range, cost, and manufacturing efficiency. EV success depends on **gradual variations in both idea quality (market demand) and implementation effectiveness (cost efficiency, supply chain constraints),** requiring a model that captures **incremental improvements, investment trade-offs, and continuous learning from market signals.** This motivates our shift to a normal distribution framework in Section 2.2, allowing for more nuanced updates and strategic adjustments.
