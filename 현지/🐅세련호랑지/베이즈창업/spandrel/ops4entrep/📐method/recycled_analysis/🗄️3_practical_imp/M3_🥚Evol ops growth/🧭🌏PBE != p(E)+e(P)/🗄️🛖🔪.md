This development process mirrors Lacan's object petit a concept in several ways. Just as the "black house" in Å½iÅ¾ek's analysis functions as an empty space that enables projection of desires, the blade structure's constraints created a productive void in battery design. The safety requirement acted like the physical structure of the "black house" - seemingly limiting but actually enabling new possibilities. What appeared as "nothing" (structural constraints) became "something" (multiple innovations) through the projection of engineering possibilities onto this structural void. This exemplifies what Felin and Kauffman (2023) call "functional excess" - where features emerge not from deliberate optimization but from exploring the empty spaces created by structural constraints. The blade structure represents a spandrel - an unintended architectural byproduct that gained new functions through discovery rather than design.
