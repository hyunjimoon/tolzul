treating vital
- Co-opted Adaptation: Intentionally developed drugs that found additional uses while maintaining original function
- Co-opted Nonaption: Accidental discoveries or byproducts that revealed unexpected therapeutic value

1. Co-opted Adaptation: A trait that was previously shaped by natural selection for a specific function (an adaptation) is co-opted for a new use ‚Äî cooptation.
2. Co-Opted Nonaption: A trait whose origin cannot be attributed to the direct action of natural selection (a nonaption) is co-opted for a current use ‚Äî cooption or spandrel.
