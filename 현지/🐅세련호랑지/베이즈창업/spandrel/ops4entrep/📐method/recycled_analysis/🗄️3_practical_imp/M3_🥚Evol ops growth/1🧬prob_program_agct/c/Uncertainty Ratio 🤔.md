| Pietro Ortoleva's paper "Modeling the Change of Paradigm: Non-Bayesian Reactions to Unexpected News"                                                | **Hypothesis UE4**: When startup perceives decreased product uncertainty $\rightarrow$ fix product, expand/pivot market | Ortoleva discusses a scenario where a new paradigm is adopted after receiving unexpected news which could not be processed by the existing set beliefs. This approach mirrors a situation where a startup, after perceiving decreased product uncertainty, may choose to retain its current product while expanding or pivoting its market to exploit newfound stability and confidence in its product. üìâüîÑüåç |

For startups, an increased market uncertainty might push them to maintain focus on their current market while pivoting their product to better align with the unpredictable environment. üìàüîßüîÑ                                                      |
| Andrea Contigiani and Daniel A. Levinthal's paper "Situating the construct of lean start-up: adjacent conversations and possible future directions" | **Hypothesis UE4**: When startup perceives decreased product uncertainty $\rightarrow$ fix product, expand/pivot market | The authors discuss the concept of pivoting, which aligns with making strategic changes based on feedback. Decreased product uncertainty suggests a solid understanding of the product, which would support focusing efforts on identifying and adapting to new market opportunities.                                                                                                                          |

With low product uncertainty, the product base is assumed stable, thus allowing startups to focus on refining or redesigning the product to better match market needs that have been solidified. ‚ú®                                                      |
| Teppo Felin and Todd R. Zenger's paper "The Theory-Based View: Economic Actors as Theorists"                                                        | **Hypothesis UE3**: When startup perceives increased market uncertainty $\rightarrow$ fix product, expand/pivot market  | Felin and Zenger argue that firms need to develop unique theories to exploit the emerging paradigm shifts. Increased market uncertainty necessitates fixing the product and leveraging the emerging market opportunities effectively.                                                                                                                                                                          |

This high uncertainty prompts firms to retain a stable product while venturing into new markets to harness new opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
