Unfortunately, I think bioninformatics is not a great field in that respect - a lot of tasks is too big/complex for Bayesian methods to be practical. Most of my Bayesian work is closer to biostatistics. In any case, I am not sure people do much calibration. The closest I came to calibration was in [https://www.martinmodrak.cz/2019/06/20/approximate-densities-for-sums-of-variables-negative-binomials-and-saddlepoint/](https://www.martinmodrak.cz/2019/06/20/approximate-densities-for-sums-of-variables-negative-binomials-and-saddlepoint/) where I use SBC to test approximations to convolutions of neg. binomial variables - this was connected to an application in bioinformatics, but we ended up not using this approach anyway. Stefano Mangiola also did something like calibration for the work on TABI and ppcSeq: [https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-021-08529-6](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-021-08529-6) , [https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/1/lqab005/6155871](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/1/lqab005/6155871) I did help with this work a bit, but the calibration was all done by Stefano (and I admit I am not completely convinced either of the software tools actually works as advertised). I'll try to think whether there are some additional examples of Bayesian calibration.
