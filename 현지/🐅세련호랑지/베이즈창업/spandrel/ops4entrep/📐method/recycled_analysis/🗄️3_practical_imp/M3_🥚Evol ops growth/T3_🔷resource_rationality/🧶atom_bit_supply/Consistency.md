1.  color coding
one direction: red
two or more direction: green

rate: blue (rate)
confined: light blue (probability)

continuous: red, green, blue
discrete, customized: purple
probability, rate, time, space

probability, rate, time are non-negative associated with volatility, cumulative variation,¬† increasing levy process**

## Birth of non-negativity
: leaf falls down, tree grows up

Time is scler and shortcut for theory

1. ‚è≥()
Time is an operator that unifies unique time clock $T_{1..N}$ of N different system participants. Operator of local system becomes operand in the above layer.

The world is created in time order (axiom 1). Iterative simulation plays excavation role, allowing us to construct data generating system (initialization updating scheme + relational system). Verification scheme is needed to verify the closeness of natural and constructed system.

The workflow for solving differential equation (weak) starts from axiom; every thing can be reconstructed in time order (i.e. tree structure). Efficiency comes from "minimal" connection. Tree structure gives projective topology on the system, allowing us to construct hierarchical tree-type weak solution on this fixed topology.

To verify among brute force generated (search among nHn ~ n!) vs verify among hierarchical-tree structure generated (search among hierarchical tree).
