###  two message: 🐓🔄 🥚(belief, action)
1. belief affects action : either to <font color  = "#green">pivot product</font> or <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font>
2. action affects belief updating process:  <font color  = "#green">pivot product</font> updates belief on market conditional on product , <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font>  only updates belief on product conditional on market (intel's tic-tok strategy)
 - choosing what to match between families of solution (supply) - families of need (demand) 
 - e.g. AstraZeneca drug repurposing (il6 arthritis drug be useful for cardiovascular purpose)
- e.g. gene therapeutics experimenting [cas9 nuclease VS sacas9 nuclease] x [SCN1A VS SCN1B gene for Dravet Syndrome]

1. slow clockspeed
2. efficacious (performance, regulation), safety, convenience (how easy), cost
###  three use case
- scholars: understand belief, action, profit, environment dynamics 
- startup educators: efficient experiment design based on factorized belief: update of product in one market can be propagated across different markets (the effect of updating manual to ai process in b2c market should affect to that in b2b market)
- startups: apply in setting boundary (low, high bar) to stay, add, change (or scale, pivot product, pivot market)

###  four action sequence
startup experiment is iteration of updating its belief and environment.  The diagram below illustrates the sequential interaction between belief, action, profit, and environment. 
- step1 (expectation): belief (B1) about the environment (E1) determines the expected profit (P1, blue arrow).  However, the observed profit (P1, orange arrow) may differ from the expected profit. 
- step2 (action): The action (A1) is then determined (red arrow) based on the comparison of expected and observed profit P1 
- step3 (update environment): action updates the environment from E1 to E2. 
- step4 (update belief): Simultaneously, the belief is updated from B1 to B2 based on the initial belief (B1) and the observed profit (P1). 
  This process continues iteratively, with each action updating the environment and each observed profit updating the belief, ultimately leading to a trajectory of beliefs (B1, B2, B3) and profits (P1, P2) over time.
