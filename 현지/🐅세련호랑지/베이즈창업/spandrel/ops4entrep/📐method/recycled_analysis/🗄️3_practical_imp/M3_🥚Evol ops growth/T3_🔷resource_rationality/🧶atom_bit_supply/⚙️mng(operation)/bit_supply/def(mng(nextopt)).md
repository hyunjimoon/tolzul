applying [[üß¢cap]] model and using [mastering 4 leadership capabilities cld](https://claude.ai/chat/f5c95a6b-e09b-4b0d-a1d7-7d875710ae3c)

The story is about creating a data analytics/forecasting solution for bakeries. The founder identified a gap between academic optimization models and real-world business practices. The startup faced challenges with data input (200+ SKUs), behavioral aspects (bakery owners preferring excess inventory), and eventually pivoted to larger companies. This led to partnership challenges and learning about stakeholder alignment.

üß¢cap() Analysis:

| Capability | Manifestation | Outcome/Learning |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Visioning | ‚Ä¢ Saw potential to apply academic models to real business<br>‚Ä¢ Wanted to bridge technology gap for SMEs<br>‚Ä¢ Identified opportunity in Korea-US differences | Strong initial vision but misaligned with reality |
| Sensemaking | ‚Ä¢ Recognized disconnect between theory and practice<br>‚Ä¢ Understood behavioral economics of bakery owners<br>‚Ä¢ Learned about preference for excess vs stockout<br>‚Ä¢ Realized data input challenges | Good theoretical understanding but missed practical constraints initially |
| Relating | ‚Ä¢ Engaged with bakery owners<br>‚Ä¢ Had co-founder misalignment<br>‚Ä¢ Struggled with partnership dynamics<br>‚Ä¢ Later learned importance of clear expectations | Major challenges in stakeholder alignment |
| Inventing | ‚Ä¢ Created forecasting prototype<br>‚Ä¢ Attempted data upload solution<br>‚Ä¢ Developed optimization algorithms<br>‚Ä¢ Pivoted to larger enterprises | Solutions weren't practical for target users |

Key Learning: The strongest initial capability was Visioning (seeing academic-practice gap), but insufficient Sensemaking and Relating led to implementation challenges. The speaker learned that early stakeholder engagement and clear expectation-setting are crucial for success.

Meta-Insight: The story itself reflects growing Sensemaking capability - the speaker can now analyze what went wrong and how it could have been done differently.

### Roadmap
Based on 1,2,3, I would aim for 4,5
#### 1. B2C+Machine failure lesson (Bakery store owner app)
Need to provide trust in data collection incentives and analytics
Bias-enhanced feedback from frequent human intervention cautions (eg, store owners who order lower orders in response to predictive services giving lower forecasts than actual forecasts to optimize satisfaction, taking into account the asymmetry bias between visible scrap inventory loss and invisible opportunity loss)

#### 2. B2B+Machine Success Factors (LogisAll)
Executives who know ‚Äúthe delay in visualizing the effect of new technology‚Äù (worse then better dynamic), and the capacity to withstand the worse period
The structure in which recovery affects the profit of decision makers (long term view)

#### 3. B2Nation+Machine success (military spare parts failure prediction)
Factors that awaken members to ‚Äúoptimization is necessary‚Äù such as shortage
*pool data within one layer: Data is not limited individually, it is possible for the entire system

#### 4. B2NB + Machine
Coordinate inter-tier (government-business) and intra-tier (business-business) collaboration. Like the crippled and blind collaboration, agility at the bottom of the hierarchy and durability at the top (*pull)
Design hierarchical auto-scaling mechanism like Wikipedia self-organize

#### 5.  B2NBC+Machine
The relationship in 4 is applied to government-business and business-small business. Collaboration between eyes and ears (small business owners), hands and feet (corporations), and heads (government).
