# Markovian Prompt for Tesla Differentiable Program Synthesis

## Task Overview

Create a comprehensive JAX-based implementation of a differentiable program synthesis system that models Tesla's early Roadster battery production decision-making process (2006-2008). This system should demonstrate how differentiable program synthesis can bridge multiple stakeholder perspectives to find optimal solutions that balance competing objectives.

## Background Context

- Tesla's early Roadster development faced critical strategic decisions around battery pack production
- The company initially chose to outsource battery packs to overseas suppliers, resulting in delays and quality issues
- A better strategy would have been a hybrid approach with partial in-house assembly and quality control
- This scenario exemplifies how differentiable program synthesis can help bridge stakeholder perspectives

## System Requirements

1. Implement a complete differentiable framework using JAX that models Tesla's battery production decision space
2. Create stakeholder utility functions that represent different perspectives on the decision
3. Implement a synthesis process that balances these competing objectives through gradient-based optimization
4. Generate natural language explanations of the tradeoffs and decisions
5. Visualize the evolution of the solution space during optimization

## Mandatory Database Table

You MUST create a structured database table in markdown format (.md) that represents the key components of the system. The table MUST demonstrate both column-wise and row-wise cohesiveness, where relationships between any four cells A(row1,col1), B(row1,col2), C(row2,col1), D(row2,col2) maintain consistency such that A:B = C:D (row-wise) and A:C = B:D (column-wise).

The table should have the following structure:

|Stakeholder|Objective Function|Key Parameters|Utility Tradeoffs|
|---|---|---|---|
|Engineering|...|...|...|
|Finance|...|...|...|
|Manufacturing|...|...|...|
|Customers|...|...|...|

This table is a mandatory deliverable and will serve as the foundation for implementing the differentiable program synthesis system.

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Define the Decision Space

Create a differentiable representation of Tesla's battery production options with the following parameters:

- `vertical_integration_level`: 0.0 (fully outsourced) to 1.0 (fully in-house)
- `supplier_proximity`: 0.0 (overseas) to 1.0 (local/in-house)
- `quality_control_level`: 0.0 (minimal) to 1.0 (comprehensive)
- `production_capacity_investment`: 0.0 (minimal) to 1.0 (maximal)
- `design_iteration_speed`: 0.0 (slow) to 1.0 (rapid)

### 2. Implement Stakeholder Utility Functions

Define differentiable utility functions for each stakeholder perspective similar to the scheme code examples provided:

```python
def engineering_utility(params):
    # Engineering team values control, quality, and iteration speed
    control = jnp.sigmoid(params['vertical_integration_level'] * 3.0)
    quality = jnp.tanh(params['quality_control_level'] * 2.5)
    iteration_speed = jnp.sigmoid(params['design_iteration_speed'] * 2.0 - 
                                 (1.0 - params['supplier_proximity']) * 1.5)
    return (control * 0.4 + quality * 0.3 + iteration_speed * 0.3)

def finance_utility(params):
    # Finance team values cost efficiency and capital efficiency
    capital_efficiency = jnp.sigmoid(2.0 - params['production_capacity_investment'] * 2.5)
    operational_cost = jnp.sigmoid(1.5 - params['vertical_integration_level'] * 1.0)
    return (capital_efficiency * 0.6 + operational_cost * 0.4)

# Add similar functions for manufacturing and customer perspectives
```

### 3. Implement Combined Objective Function

Create a weighted combination of stakeholder utilities:

```python
def combined_objective(params, weights):
    eng_util = engineering_utility(params)
    fin_util = finance_utility(params)
    mfg_util = manufacturing_utility(params)
    cust_util = customer_utility(params)
    
    return (weights['engineering'] * eng_util +
            weights['finance'] * fin_util +
            weights['manufacturing'] * mfg_util +
            weights['customer'] * cust_util)
```

### 4. Implement Gradient-Based Optimization

Use JAX's automatic differentiation to optimize the parameters:

```python
@jit
def update_step(params, weights, optimizer_state):
    loss, grads = jax.value_and_grad(lambda p: -combined_objective(p, weights))(params)
    updates, new_optimizer_state = optimizer.update(grads, optimizer_state)
    new_params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)
    return new_params, new_optimizer_state, loss
```

### 5. Implement Decision Explanation

Generate natural language explanations for the current parameter settings:

```python
def explain_decision(params):
    vertical_integration = params['vertical_integration_level']
    proximity = params['supplier_proximity']
    # Generate explanation based on parameter values
    if vertical_integration > 0.7 and proximity > 0.8:
        return "Recommended strategy: Full in-house production..."
    elif vertical_integration < 0.3 and proximity < 0.3:
        return "Recommended strategy: Full outsourcing..."
    else:
        return "Recommended strategy: Hybrid approach with local assembly..."
```

### 6. Create Visualization Functions

Implement visualization of the optimization trajectory and stakeholder satisfaction:

```python
def visualize_optimization_trajectory(history):
    # Plot parameter evolution over optimization steps
    pass

def visualize_stakeholder_satisfaction(params_history, weights):
    # Plot stakeholder utility over optimization steps
    pass
```

## Example Usage

```python
# Initial parameters (Tesla's actual initial strategy)
initial_params = {
    'vertical_integration_level': jnp.array(0.2),  # Mostly outsourced
    'supplier_proximity': jnp.array(0.1),          # Overseas suppliers
    'quality_control_level': jnp.array(0.4),       # Moderate quality control
    'production_capacity_investment': jnp.array(0.3), # Low initial investment
    'design_iteration_speed': jnp.array(0.6)       # Moderate iteration speed
}

# Equal stakeholder weights
weights = {
    'engineering': 0.25,
    'finance': 0.25,
    'manufacturing': 0.25,
    'customer': 0.25
}

# Run optimization
optimized_params = optimize_parameters(initial_params, weights, iterations=100)

# Generate explanation
explanation = explain_decision(optimized_params)
print(explanation)

# Visualize results
visualize_optimization_trajectory(params_history)
visualize_stakeholder_satisfaction(params_history, weights)
```

The system should demonstrate that the optimal solution converges to a hybrid strategy with higher vertical integration and local supplier proximity than Tesla's initial approach, matching the eventual strategy Tesla adopted after experiencing delays.

## Deliverables

1. The mandatory database table showing stakeholder perspectives and their interactions
2. Complete JAX-based implementation of the differentiable program synthesis system
3. Visualization of the optimization process
4. Generated explanations of the optimal strategy and tradeoffs
5. Analysis comparing the synthesized strategy to Tesla's actual historical decisions
