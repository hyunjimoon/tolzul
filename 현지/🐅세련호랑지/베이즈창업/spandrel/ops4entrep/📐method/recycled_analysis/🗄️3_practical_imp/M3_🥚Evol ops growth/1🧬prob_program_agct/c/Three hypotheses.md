when to push than pull?
act in the face of indifference
1. new technology has larger opportunity space (1 > -1)
2.  

pivot product/pivot market action increases from 3/0 to 1.8/1.2 as mu_diff increases from -4 to 4 (this keeps optimality)
adoption = appeal * attractiveness


size itself doesn't matter but "ratio" mu_b_d / mu_c_d determines; pushing increases 

mechanism of first p action triggering m action (give feedback; high fidelity test with low cost as ppl are interested in tech by itself e.g. clean energy OM professor in hbs)

### input of hypotheses
$\hat{\mu}_{bc-}^0=\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0 - \hat{\mu}_{cd}^0$  
$\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0 = \hat{\mu_b}^0 - \mu_b^0$  
$\hat{\mu_{cd}}^0 = \hat{\mu_c}^0 - \mu_c^0$
$\hat{\mu}_{bc+}^0 = \hat{\mu}_{bd}^0 + \hat{\mu}_{cd}^0$

### output of hypotheses
R ($\in 0, 1, \infty$) is ratio of <font color  = "green">pivot product</font>  to  <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font> given two experiment opportunity

need sequence analysis but hostile environment after pivoting to new market discourage

when they 
more likely to pivot product first 

when mu_diff is negative (more optimistic in technology than market), `pivot product` more when real value of NewDemand-OldSupply is higher than  NewSupply-OldMarket (hope factor; settle market (ENT), keep update product (ppl)) 

situation is better than technology s (have enough courage??)

| R1: $\frac{dR}{d\hat{\mu}_{bc-}^0} > 0$     | Suppose a startup believes AI products are more cost-effective than non-AI alternatives ($\mu_{m2a}$ increases). This belief leads them to prioritize experiments improving their AI offering over considering a switch from b2c to b2b markets ($\mu_{f2s}$). Positive results like reduced cloud computing costs (CC-.05) further reinforce their focus on AI, resulting in more product tweaks than market changes. These product iterations in turn update the AI vs. non-AI product belief for the next round ($\mu_{m2a,t+1}$) while keeping the market belief constant ($\mu_{f2s,t+1}$).                                                                                                                                                                                      | angle of vector<br><br>push vs pull                                                                                |
| R2: $\frac{d^2R}{d(\hat{\mu}_{bc+}^0)^2}<0$ | Imagine a startup optimistic about its AI product and b2b market based on encouraging early signs ($\mu_{m2a}$ and $\mu_{f2s}$ high). This optimism drives them to run bold experiments targeting enterprise clients aligned with their AI strengths. However, if the experiments reveal only tepid demand, the startup's high hopes will compel them to keep searching for better market fits rather than settling, thereby decreasing the product-to-market pivot ratio. Conversely, a startup with more modest initial expectations will be less demanding and more willing to refine its product when facing lackluster market signals, thus increasing product pivots. These differing actions then shape the respective belief trajectories ($\mu_{m2a,t+1}$, $\mu_{f2s,t+1}$). | size of vector<br><br>optimism                                                                                     |
| R3: $\frac{dR}{d(k\sigma)} > 0$             | Consider an early-stage startup facing high profit uncertainty due to fluctuating customer demand ($\sigma$ high). This uncertainty expands the acceptable range of outcomes to maintain course ($\mu_{pb} \pm k\sigma$), making the startup more likely to stick with its current b2b focus ($\mu_{f2s}$) and test product variations. Given the uncertain climate, even mixed signals like modest consumer interest (RF+.05) alongside some troubling bugs (CC+.05) are viewed as grounds to persist with product experiments rather than rethink the market. These product tweaks then update AI product beliefs ($\mu_{m2a,t+1}$) while b2b market convictions remain steady ($\mu_{f2s,t+1}$), promoting further product trials next cycle.                                      | clarity of vector<br><br>$\hat{\sigma}_{profit}$ affects choice of pivoting action as much as $\hat{\mu}_{profit}$ |

The three hypotheses illustrate the dynamic interplay between beliefs, observations, and actions over time. The startup's beliefs at each stage ($\mu_{m2a,t}$, $\mu_{f2s,t}$, $\mu_{pb,t}$) steer their experiment choices, shaping the signals they observe (e.g. CC-.05, RF+.05). These signals are then interpreted through their current belief system to decide whether to adjust the product, modify the market, or stay the course. Importantly, the type of change enacted (product or market pivot) updates the corresponding beliefs for the next period ($\mu_{m2a,t+1}$, $\mu_{f2s,t+1}$, $\mu_{pb,t+1}$), perpetuating the cycle.

The relative pull between product and market beliefs (R1), the degree of optimism (R2), and the level of uncertainty (R3) all shape this learning loop, guiding the startup's evolution. By understanding these forces, startups can be more deliberate in their experimentation, leading to a greater chance of success.

- RO is ratio of pivot product to pivot market

O2: $\frac{d^2O}{d(\hat \mu_{bc+}^0)^2}<0$

### 2. belief determines action
same signal can lead to different action depending on mu, sigma, k configuration

### **H1: Increased $\mu_{b_d} - \mu_{c_d}$ leads to increased Pivot Ratio (pivot_product / pivot_market)**

**Explanation**: This hypothesis posits that when the difference between the means $\mu_{b_d}$ and $\mu_{c_d}$ increases, the likelihood of a product pivot compared to a market pivot also increases. This could be due to a greater perceived benefit or potential in changing the product rather than the market when the belief in the product's potential significantly outweighs the market's.

### **H2: Increased $\mu$ of profit (same $\sigma$) leads to increased Reach of optimal cell**

**Explanation**: This hypothesis suggests that higher average profits ($\mu$) lead to a greater likelihood of reaching the optimal cell. Keeping the standard deviation ($\sigma$) constant means that while the variability in profit remains unchanged, the overall expected profit is higher, which encourages decisions that align more closely with reaching the optimal configuration.

### **H3: Increased $\sigma$ of profit (same $\mu$) leads to increased Pivot Ratio**

**Explanation**: Here, it is hypothesized that higher variability in profit ($\sigma$) increases the frequency of product pivots relative to market pivots. The higher uncertainty (greater $\sigma$) may make decision-makers more inclined to experiment with changing the product as a means to manage risk and potentially capture higher rewards, leading to a higher pivot ratio.

### **H4: Increased $\sigma$ of profit (same $\mu$) leads to decreased Reach of optimal cell**

**Explanation**: This hypothesis asserts that higher variability in profit ($\sigma$), while keeping the mean ($\mu$) constant, decreases the likelihood of reaching the optimal cell. The increased uncertainty introduces more variability in outcomes, making it harder to consistently make decisions that lead directly to the optimal configuration, thus reducing the reach of the optimal cell.
