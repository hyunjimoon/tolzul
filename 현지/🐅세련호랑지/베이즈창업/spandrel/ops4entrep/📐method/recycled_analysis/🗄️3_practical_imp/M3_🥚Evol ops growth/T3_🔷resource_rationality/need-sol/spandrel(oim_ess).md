Develop and implement a comprehensive suite of tools, including visual maps of the research landscape, customized training programs for PhD students and researchers, and interactive platforms for academia-industry collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- attend targeted training programs, such as EMTOM PhD seminar, to equip Ph.D. with the skills needed to navigate journal market.
- plan capability growth of `need`, `search`, `deliver` across different scholarly phases.
- list three markets and three products, compare product market fit of nine combinations, identify top three product-market pair then reverse engineer capacity (education, training, ) to avoid false start and pre-mature scaling pitfalls

and application but scholar are not trained to strategically manage capacity stocks of `need` (research question with domain knowledge), `search` (methodology), `deliver` (identify journals and readers).

Knowledge useful for Research production strategy is not customized to early-stage scholars (Ph.D.s) is not routed

**Short-listing solution and need candidates**
1. gather information and update priors on market acceptance and size to persuade value proposition and strategize experiments
2. define objective function for producers (impact, value, currency in academia)
3. match needs and solutions that maximize objective function

**Short-listing product and market candidates and identifying product-market fit (PMF)**
1. specify desirability with customer feedback and feasibility with supplier feedback
2. sampling algorithms that learns covariance among products and covariance among market segments which translates into covariance among product-market fit. by combining this with ratio of cost for changing market to changing product we can systematically update our belief on different implementation of our solution (research product, paper) and belief on market acceptance of our solution.
3. optimizing: News-vendor, parallel vs. sequential processes

**Preparing for scaling**
1. four roles in enterprise and scaling tools
- CTO: professionalize (e.g. modeler)
- COO: acculturate, replicate, collaborate (collaborator outside academia e.g. partnering with samsung hospital, Wayfair), automate, platformize (community), processify
- CFO: capitalize grant writing
- CMO: segment, evaluate
2. phase-based planning
**nail stage**
- test desirability and technical feasibility of our research question
- iterate between phenomena, theory, measurement to nail our value proposition that satisfies us, customer (paper reader or our future students), investor (advisor)
**scale stage**
- test operational feasibility and viability of our research before investing significant time and energy
- **collaborate** with equipment providers (data and tool providers), sampled customers (trusted colleagues and faculty), investor (referee), using and to develop our **profession**
- **segment** customer and set beachhead (research outlet's audience)
- build community both from supply and demand side and **acculturate** our vision, share progress in the language of aligned **evaluation** metric
- compare perspectives on blitzscaling vs. premature scaling
- [Fine et al. 2022, Operations for entrepreneurs: Can Operations Management make a difference in entrepreneurial theory and practice?](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/148032): Ten tools for scaling 
- [When do startups scale up](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4015530): when premature scaling strategies work or not
**sail stage**
- **processify** the above that helps us **automate, replicate, platformize, capitalize** the knowledge creation itself

2. customize production strategy (e.g. design experiment and survey with highest information gain) by learning how to balance product and market uncertainty and elicit needs of diverse stakeholders in knowledge production value chain e.g. designer, developer, supplier, distributor, customer

3. self-educate through visual tools that shows relationship (e.g. correlation) between products (tested and measured speculation that explains phenomena) and markets (journals)
