A policy is expressed in general by a policy equation, not by a   
single parameter. Policy equations naturally have policy parameters. I   
think you mean something like: ‘can policy analysis be carried out by   
simply changing values of policy parameters?' The answer is: not   
always, but to a great extent. In more advanced policy analysis, we   
need to change the forms of the policy equations, not just parameter   
values. But I now strongly suggest that you ignore this at this point   
and focus on parameters values of fixed policy equations.

## Why dynamic decisions are difficult
- "no decision maker" [by Jay Forrester](http://static.clexchange.org/ftp/documents/system-dynamics/SD2007-08SDTheNext50Years.pdf)
```
One hears repeatedly the question of how we in system dynamics might reach “decision makers.” With respect to the important questions, there are no decision makers. Those at the top of a hierarchy only appear to have influence. They can act on small questions and small deviations from current practice, but they are subservient to the constituencies that support them. This is true in both government and in corporations. The big issues cannot be dealt with in the realm of small decisions. If you want to nudge a small change in government, you can apply systems thinking logic, or draw a few causal loop diagrams, or hire a lobbyist, or bribe the right people. However, solutions to the most important sources of social discontent require reversing cherished policies that are causing the trouble. There are no decision makers with the power and courage to reverse ingrained policies that would be directly contrary to public expectations. Before one can hope to influence government, one must build the public constituency to support policy reversals.
