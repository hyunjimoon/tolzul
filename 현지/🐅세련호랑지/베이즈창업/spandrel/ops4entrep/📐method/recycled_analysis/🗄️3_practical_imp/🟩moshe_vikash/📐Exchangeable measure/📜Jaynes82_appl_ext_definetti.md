| Section 🧭 | Core Question 🤔 | Theoretical Framework 🗺️ | Mathematical Expression 🧠 | Key Findings 👓 |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1. Introduction | Why do we need to extend de Finetti's representation? | 🧍‍♀️ Bank deposits example showing symmetric distributions need extension | p(x₁...xₙ) symmetric under permutations | 🌏 Original theorem limited to infinite exchangeable sequences |
| 2. Generating Function | How does the LdF representation work? | 🧭 Exchangeable sequences characterized by single function | p(r\|n) = ∫₀¹(n,r)z^r(1-z)^(n-r)g(z)dz | 🗺️ g(z) is complete characterization of exchangeable sequence |
| 3. Example | How does representation fail in simple cases? | 🗺️ Two-point vs three-point symmetric distributions | A + 2B + C = 1 (normalization) & constraint equations | 🧠 LdF can't represent negative correlations |
| 4. Orthogonal Expansions | How to fix using orthogonal polynomials? | 🧭 Legendre polynomials as natural basis | g(z) = Σ(2k+1)aₖPₖ(2z-1) | 🤜 Transform to Legendre basis solves projection problem |
| 5. Finite Sequences | What happens when we drop g(z)≥0? | 🗺️ Modified representation for finite sequences | Expansion coefficients aᵢ freed from positivity | 👓 Every finite exchangeable sequence has representation |
| 6. N-Representability | When can n-point come from N-point distribution? | 🌏 Geometric view in coefficient space | Point {a₀...aₙ} must lie in projection of Sₙ | 🧠 Complete solution via projected vertices |
| 7. Conclusion | What are the physical applications? | 🧭 BBGKY hierarchy & kinetic theory | dg/dt = Kg (evolution equation) | 👓 New foundation for statistical physics |
