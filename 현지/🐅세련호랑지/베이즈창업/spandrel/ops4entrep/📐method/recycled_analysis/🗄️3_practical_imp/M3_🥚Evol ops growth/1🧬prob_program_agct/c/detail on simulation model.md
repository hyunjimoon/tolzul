### main message: üêìüîÑ ü•ö(belief, action)
1. belief affects action : either to <font color  = "#green">pivot product</font> or <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font>
2. action affects belief updating process:  <font color  = "#green">pivot product</font> updates belief on market conditional on product , <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font>  only updates belief on product conditional on market (intel's tic-tok strategy)
 - choosing what to match between families of solution (supply) - families of need (demand) 
 - e.g. AstraZeneca drug repurposing (il6 arthritis drug be useful for cardiovascular purpose)
 - e.g. [[quantumcomp(drugdisc)]]
- e.g. gene therapeutics experimenting [cas9 nuclease VS sacas9 nuclease] x [SCN1A VS SCN1B gene for Dravet Syndrome]

mechanism behind how belief and action affect each other. three usecase:
- understand belief, action, profit, environment dynamics 
- educate efficient experiment design based on factorized belief: update of product in one market can be propagated across different markets (the effect of updating manual to ai process in b2c market should affect to that in b2b market)
- apply in setting boundary (low, high bar) to stay, add, change (or scale, pivot product, pivot market)

startup experiment is iteration of updating its belief and environment.

Thank you for emphasizing the importance of D. Sculley's paper. I understand you're looking for more specific, prescriptive advice for entrepreneurs based on this work. I'll provide a more detailed breakdown of how Sculley's insights can be applied to entrepreneurial ventures:


 


and belief affects action an actual effects, belief, for instance, based on how trendy how effective the new base editor with me the action here is defined as either pivoting the market pepper in the product or pepper in the market for us is Jim therapeutics they have base additur, new technology, coming up base, editor, and Marquette. 

They can either choose old or new base editor, CAS9 or sacas9 nuclease (product) / general or rare diseases (market).

#### CEO likes 4 params

As a CEO, I would prefer a more intuitive parameterization that directly relates to the profitability of each product-market combination. Instead of using separate parameters for the baseline profit, cost difference, and revenue difference, I would use a single parameter for each product-market combination, representing its expected profit. This way, the decision-making process becomes more straightforward, as we can directly compare the expected profits of each option.

Sure! Let me adjust the signals and update the table accordingly to maintain values in 0.05 unit increments.

experience is 
hard constraint
- Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him [[aldous_huxley]], same signal is accepted differently depending on one's perceived quality (AI, who sees risk and the others sees opportunity)

‚≠êÔ∏èby definition, pivot_product.stan should get belief on market as data and update belief on product (in parameter block). pivot_market.stan should get belief on product as data and update belief on market (in parameter block). for first.stan, belief on market and product would be homogenous across market and product which would be the function of optimism and uncertainty on market over product. depending on which product and market are chosen at each experiment, belief udpate would differ

e2p: map experiment index to product index
e2m: map experiment index to market index

e.g. if startup has done five experiments and pivoted as  (300, Rural) - (400, Rural) - (400, Urban) - (300, Urban), and letting Rural, Urban as market index 1,2 and 300, 400 as product index 1,2,  e2p is [[1,2,2,1] and e2m is [1,1,2,2]

‚≠êÔ∏èupdating all previous states of belief based on one experiment? (does it mean at each step, you revisit all previous expectation so that it could have more precise prediction in next experiment). 

```
generated quantities { 
	vector[E] updated_ma; 
	vector[E] updated_pf; 
	for (e in 1:E) { 
		updated_ma[e] = ma[e]; 
		updated_pf[e] = pf[e]; 
		} 
}
```



‚≠êÔ∏è `pf_r` vs `ma_b` adjusting production specification with belief on market acceptance fixed. estimated production becomes real (pf_r); NOT a SPEC, but fitting to customer needs???


‚≠êÔ∏è we observe only the real profit (not revenue), which is why EM alg is needed as we learn by fixing rev_b[market[e]], updating cost_b[product[e]], then  fixing cost_b[product[e]], updating rev_b[market[e]].

‚≠êÔ∏èhow weight affects ground truth reverse engineering: changing the weight for updating the baseline profit ($\mu_b$) from .2 to .05, the inferred ground-truth values should be adjusted accordingly. The reason is that the smaller weight gives less importance to the signals related to the baseline profit, which means the inferred ground-truth value for $\mu_b$ should be closer to the initial belief of 0.5.

‚≠êÔ∏èframework represent the idea with low quality doesn't have much cell that works (out of the four). this means comparing the number of cells that passes high bar with mu_a_b can give us the sense of mu_a_b (give me the code of an experiment that shows higher mu_a_b has more cells whose profit exceeds low bar). iterate through different combination of product and market and count how many cells' predicted profit exceeds

## 1. startup learns from environment's evaluation and its pivot sequence 


[[Pasted image 20240430173421.png]]

The four diagrams illustrate the learning process of an early stage startup agent navigating to find product-market fit. It shows how one experiment updates startup's belief, how updated belief determines the next experiment. This is framed as choice of actions (market pivot and product pivot) in an integrative simulation model. Integrative is defined as a model that predict outcomes and estimate effects under intervention in as yet unseen situations (Hofman et. al., 2021).

(a) explains how the agent's belief is updated based on learning from external evaluation. The startup predicts the range of evaluation based on distributions of:

1. Optimism `a`: The startup's belief about how well its average product will be accepted by the average market, standardized by the uncertainty of the product. Mathematically, it is represented as $\frac{ùúá_ùëù - ùúá_ùëö}{ùúé_ùëù}$, where $ùúá_ùëù$ is the mean belief about product acceptance, $ùúá_ùëö$ is the mean belief about market acceptance, and $ùúé_ùëù$ is the uncertainty of the product.

2. Uncertainty on market over uncertainty on product ($\frac{ùúé_ùëö}{ùúé_ùëù}$): The ratio of uncertainty of market acceptance ($ùúé_ùëö$) to uncertainty of product feasibility ($ùúé_ùëù$). This ratio is used to update the startup's belief based on the gap between the predicted and actual market evaluation.

The market's evaluation is generated based on distributions of:

- Dynamic market: This component represents the dynamic nature of the market, which evolves over time. It is characterized by the mean market acceptance ($ùúá_ùëö$).

- Uncertainty of product feasibility ($ùúé_ùëù$): This represents the startup's uncertainty about the performance and feasibility of its product in the market.

Section 4.Belief update Stan Code Explained in Relation to the Table and Diagram. introduces what data is given, which prior is used, how parameter estimation happens in detail using Stan code.

(b) Agent operationalize the learning in (a) choose action (between internal pivot (= product pivot: fix market, change product) and external pivot (= market pivot: fix product, change market).

(c) The action is a choice between a market pivot and a product pivot. An example is an EV company that starts in a rural market but receives a poor evaluation (1 out of 5) due to the lack of charging infrastructure. The company had expected a range of 3 to 5, so the gap between the actual evaluation (1) and the predicted average (4) prompts the company to consider two options: pivoting to an urban market with better infrastructure (market pivot) or changing their product to a hybrid vehicle (product pivot) that relies less on charging infrastructure.

(d) The action sequence is represented as a state transition diagram, showing how the startup's belief and actions evolve over time based on the learning from each experiment and the resulting pivot decisions. states is defined as (m, p, o, u, e) m: current market, p: current product, o: optimism (mean of prediction for evaluation), u: uncertainty (standard deviation of prediction for evaluation), e: remaining experiment opportunity.
## 2. hypothesis, literature, startup examples 

Based on the action item and the goal of focusing on the EV industry to improve the DUOER theory, here is an updated table with EV examples that illustrate the 3x3 grid of product choices (ICE, Hybrid, EV) and market choices (Rural, Suburban, Urban):

Based on the provided documents and your guidance, I have updated the ten hypotheses in the table to address the concern about the difference between pivoting (exiting the old market) and expanding. The updated hypotheses incorporate insights from the concept of pivoting, the discussion on coordinate, vector angle, and speed, and the goal of providing a dynamic canvas to make entrepreneurial decision-making science more cumulative.

- Bayesian entrepreneurship literature provides substantial support for the key hypotheses in the table. Papers like Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf (2016), Kerr et al. (2014), and Camuffo et al. (2020) highlight how uncertainty and experimentation shape the way entrepreneurs navigate the search for product-market fit by testing products and markets, consistent with the push and pull learning strategies outlined. The role of risk tolerance in driving more ambitious experiments is also well-documented by authors such as Manso (2016) and Ewens et al. (2018). These findings help validate the Bayesian learning framework proposed.

- To prevent learning degeneracy, we uniformize product belief by fixing the confidence on product. In other words, three parameters that determine the expected evaluation $\mu$ = market + product mean, $\sigma_{market}$, $\sigma_{product}$ is parameterized as $\frac{\mu}{\sigma_{product}}$, $\frac{\sigma_{market}}{\sigma_{product}}$. The `learning` , defined as the difference between expected and real evaluation, is used to update optimism and confidence on market. 

- product, market are umbrella terms for supply, demand. technology, customer. 

| product            | market           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| supply, technology | demand, customer |

#### Data Block
- **`int<lower=0, upper=1> E;`**  
  Represents a binary outcome of product evaluation‚Äîeither good (`1`) or bad (`0`). This parameter directly corresponds to "sampled evaluation" in your framework, capturing the binary outcome of market acceptance.

- **`real a_mean_b;`**  
  Signifies the average baseline optimism about a product receiving good evaluations. This parameter can be associated with "O: Optimism," reflecting the startup's confidence in the product's success across the average market, adjusted for product and market variability.

- **`real<lower=0> U;`**  
    Measures the startup's uncertainty about the market relative to the uncertainty about the product. This directly ties to "U: Uncertainty ratio," quantifying the relationship between market and product uncertainties.
#### Parameters Block
- **`vector[N] a;`**  
  This array represents the optimism levels for each evaluation, catering to market-specific conditions. It aligns with the "D: Dynamic Market," where market dynamics influence individual perceptions about the product's success.

- **`real<lower=0> sigma;`**  
  Defines the standard deviation for optimism across evaluations, reflecting market stability or instability. This relates to "E: Experiment opportunity" as it models the extent of variability that can be tolerated or explored during market testing.

#### Model Block
- **`sigma ~ exponential(U);`**  
  The distribution of `sigma` suggests that higher confidence (lower uncertainty about the market) leads to less variability in optimism, which is consistent with a stable market environment (lower "U: Uncertainty ratio").

- **`a ~ normal(a_mean_b, sigma);`**  
  The optimism for each product is modeled to follow a normal distribution centered around the baseline optimism, adjusted for the standard deviation dictated by market confidence. This captures the essence of "R: Risk-cash Tolerance" by quantifying how risk tolerance affects optimism variance.

- **`p = inv_logit(a);`**  
  Translates the adjusted optimism into a probability metric (`p`), which predicts the likelihood of receiving good evaluations. This is a critical step linking theoretical predictions to practical outcomes.

- **`E ~ bernoulli(p);`**  
  Models the observed evaluations as a Bernoulli process, influenced by the computed probabilities. This directly demonstrates how internal optimism and external market dynamics converge to shape real-world product evaluations.
