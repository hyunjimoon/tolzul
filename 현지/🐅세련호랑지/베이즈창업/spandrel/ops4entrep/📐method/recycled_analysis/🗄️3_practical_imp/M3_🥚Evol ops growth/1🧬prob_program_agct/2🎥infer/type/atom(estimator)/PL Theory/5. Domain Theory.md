## Domain Theory

### Previous Chapter Recap
In the previous chapter, we were defining denotational semantics of various commands. The denotational semantics of `while` command couldn't be expressed with normal state transformations:
$$
\
[\![\text{while} \ b \ \text{do} \ c]\!]\sigma =
\ \text{if} [\![ b ]\!]_\text{boolean} \ \text{then} \ ([\![ \text{while} \ b \ \text{do} \ c ]\!])_\bot ([\![ c ]\!]\sigma) \ \text{else} \ \sigma
$$

To tackle this problem, we now think of the set of meanings as a *domain*, which is equipped with orders between meanings, such that the actual semantics of `while` is the least element of the domain.

### Domains of Meanings
We were interested in the semantics of an arbitrary command, $[\![ C ]\!]$. All semantic meanings are an element of a set of semantic meanings:

$$
\begin{aligned} \
[\![ C ]\!] \in \mathcal{D}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Complete Partial Order

A domain that has *complete partial order*(CPO) is a special kind of a partially ordered set. Partial order, written as $\sqsubseteq$ represents order of how much information each element presents. For example, 
$$
x \sqsubseteq y \sqsubseteq z
$$
means that $y$ provides at least as much information as $x$, and $z$ provides at least much information as $y$.
