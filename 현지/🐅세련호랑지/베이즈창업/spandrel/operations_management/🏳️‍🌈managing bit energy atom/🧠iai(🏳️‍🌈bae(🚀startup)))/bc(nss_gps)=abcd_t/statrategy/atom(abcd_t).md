2.2.1. Sampling Existing Customers vs. Others. A first class of experimental choice is with regard to whether a firm evaluates a technology by sampling existing customers or others. Earlier, we noted the discussion by Christensen (1997) of established firms receiving feedback on new technological opportunities from their existing customers. Although Christensen expressed and argued it informally, we can express it in information-theoretic terms. Specifically, your own customers are an information source (e.g., the subjects of a survey; i.e., the experiment design) that gives you a signal of the magnitude of any increment to profits you might achieve from exploiting a new technological opportunity. Survey results are potentially a rich source of information. However, a good design would allow for a mapping from that feedback into a signal of whether the opportunity is likely to be positive or not.
Seen in this light, what Christensen (1997) is saying is that the signal you receive from your own customers is slanted toward unfavorable news.5If a technology happens to be disruptive then, in Christensen’s conception, that means that it involves features that your own customers may not want because they are coupled with a reduction in quality of features they value: “They typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that, at least at the outset, are not valued by existing customers.” (Bower and Christensen 1995, p. 3) For a disruptive technology, this makes it more likely that you will receive a false-negative signal (that a technology is not promising when it is) than a false-positive signal (that a technology is promising when it is not). 
Christensen argues that existing customers, precisely because they are satisfied with a firm’s current products, cannot evaluate the tradeoffs properly. When you ask your own customers about a technology that happens to be disruptive, it is difficult to get a clear signal that the
