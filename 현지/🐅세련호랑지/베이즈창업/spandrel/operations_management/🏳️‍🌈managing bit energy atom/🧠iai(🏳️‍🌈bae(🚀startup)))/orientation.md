#orientation 
## Shifting Cycles
- hierarchical system
- innovation, which is disruptive should gain trust to have effect
- cycle originates from feedback within hierarchical system (hiring, pricing, manufacturing, order fulfilling) - no oscillation in SI system 
- push and pull strategy on platform: pulling innovation until the threshold of trust then push
- measuring whether cycles have been shifted (e.g. dynamic hypothesis testing; counterfactual)
- examples: agency, film, vaccine (do we call vaccine innovation? #tfq)
- statistical approach of table function
- hierarchical system (prey-predator) has "competition" positive feedback? could we call horizontal parameter estimation as (wip, inventory adj time) as SI, vertical parameter estimation PP?
