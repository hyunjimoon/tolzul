four types of pivot exist: 

| from \ to | atom         | bit                               |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| atom      | zerox        | mac applications, nvdia software? |
| bit       | google glass | seq. of research, movie           |

dynamics should be shifted from c2s for all four cases (do we adjust table function for project portfolio?)

- need for shifting dynamics (c2s, [[two_box|two_box]])
