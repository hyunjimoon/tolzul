CEO Martin Eberhard announced a revision: "we have officially revised our range expectations for the Tesla Roadster to **more than 200 miles** per charge, rather than our original goal of 250 miles." This revision was further explained by Vehicle Systems Engineer Andrew Simpson in a **May 10, 2007** Tesla blog post titled "Miles of Progress," where he wrote confidently that he had "personally driven 200 miles on the streets of San Carlos" in an early prototype.

company's communication style—whether intentional or accidental—avoided the trap of over-precision that ensnared Better Place. The range promises that did exist came through official channels and other executives, maintaining a degree of institutional distance that proved valuable when adjustments were needed.

By December 2007, Tesla officially restated the EPA range downward from 245 to 221 miles due to transmission issues.

Better Place, anchored to Agassi's precise "3-minute" swaps and specific infrastructure promises, found no such flexibility when their $850 million in funding couldn't deliver on the exacting vision promised to investors, governments, and the public.
