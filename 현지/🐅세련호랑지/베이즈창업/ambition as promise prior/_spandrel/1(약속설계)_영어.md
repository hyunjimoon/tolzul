# The Structure of Entrepreneurial Promises: A Bayesian Theory of Innovation Trajectories

## 1. Introduction

In 2010, two ventures promised revolutionary transportation. Tesla claimed their vehicles would achieve "roughly 200 miles" of range. Better Place guaranteed "exactly 160 kilometers" between battery swaps, with "precisely 3-minute" exchanges at automated stations. Five years later, Tesla had successfully pivoted into energy storage (Powerwall), solar integration, and grid services—markets that didn't exist when the company started. Better Place, despite raising $850 million and deploying infrastructure across multiple countries, had collapsed entirely. The ventures began with similar technologies, comparable funding, and experienced founders. What explains their divergent fates?

The answer lies not in their capabilities but in their promise structures. Tesla's "roughly" preserved variance—mathematical room for adaptation when battery technology evolved differently than expected, when customers revealed preferences for home charging over battery swapping, when new markets emerged for stationary storage. Better Place's "exactly" eliminated variance—locking the venture into specific technical specifications that became prisons when reality diverged from plans. This pattern repeats across industries. Theranos promised "exactly 4 hours" for "precisely 200 tests" from "exactly one drop" of blood. Nikola guaranteed "exactly 1,000 miles" range with "zero emissions." The specificity that made these ventures fundable also made their failures inevitable.

We formalize this phenomenon through a Bayesian model where promises are Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ) distributions, establishing three interconnected theoretical contributions:

- **First, Promise as Structure**: We reconceptualize entrepreneurial promises from communication acts to structural constraints. The promise distribution Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ) is not merely descriptive but constitutive—it mathematically determines which futures remain accessible and which become impossible. Through simulation-based calibration (Cook et al., 2006), we show that promises create time-reversed causality: P(present actions|future state) rather than P(future state|present conditions). The precision parameter τ governs this structural constraint more powerfully than strategy, technology, or execution.

- **Second, Distributional Design**: We prove that innovation requires preserving variance σ² = μ(1-μ)/(τ+1) > 0.02 through distributional rather than point promises. This variance is not uncertainty to be eliminated but "exaptation space"—the mathematical capacity for features developed for one purpose to be repurposed for another. Tesla's preserved variance enabled batteries designed for vehicles to become home energy systems. Better Place's eliminated variance prevented any such evolution. We derive optimal promise architectures: ambition μ* = 1/(n+1) where n is operational complexity, and precision bounds τ < μ(1-μ)/ε - 1 to maintain learning capability. This variance preservation mechanism naturally enables exaptation—the evolutionary process whereby features developed for one function are repurposed for another, as when Tesla's vehicle batteries became home energy systems.

- **Third, Mathematical Fraud Theory**: We demonstrate that extreme precision creates the mathematical inevitability of deception. When τ > μ(1-μ)/ε - 1, Bayesian updating becomes impossible—the posterior cannot meaningfully differ from the prior regardless of evidence. Entrepreneurs facing this constraint confront only two options: abandon the venture or misrepresent progress. This transforms fraud from an ethical choice to a structural outcome. Theranos's τ ≈ 95 and Nikola's τ ≈ 100 made honest adaptation mathematically impossible, explaining why ventures with radically different founders and contexts exhibited identical patterns of deception.

These contributions form a coherent theoretical system. Contribution 1 establishes the ontological foundation—what promises are as mathematical objects that structure venture trajectories. Contribution 2 provides the operational mechanism—how to design promises through variance preservation and complexity-adjusted ambition. Contribution 3 reveals the boundary conditions—when promise architectures fail and force pathological outcomes. Together, they offer a complete theory that is simultaneously descriptive (explaining why Tesla succeeded while Better Place failed), prescriptive (providing a τ management protocol for entrepreneurs), and predictive (identifying conditions under which fraud becomes mathematically inevitable). This theoretical completeness distinguishes our framework from partial approaches that address only communication, only flexibility, or only fraud in isolation. Methodologically, we demonstrate how Bayesian tools—particularly simulation-based calibration and hierarchical inference—can formalize entrepreneurial phenomena previously relegated to qualitative description.

These insights unify fragmented theoretical perspectives. March's (1991) exploration-exploitation dichotomy becomes a continuum along τ, with exploration corresponding to low precision (τ < 10) and exploitation to high precision (τ > 50). Real options theory (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994) gains mathematical precision through variance σ² as the quantifiable measure of option value. Path dependence (Arthur, 1989) emerges endogenously from promise architecture rather than historical accident—high τ creates lock-in through variance depletion, not through increasing returns. The liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) transforms from an age effect to a precision effect—young ventures succeed not due to their youth but their preserved flexibility.

The remainder of this paper develops these insights as follows. Section 2 constructs the formal model, proving the impossibility theorems and deriving optimal promise parameters. Section 3 presents comparative statics and testable predictions distinguishing our theory from alternatives. Section 4 provides empirical evidence through natural language processing of venture communications and systematic analysis of success and failure patterns. Section 5 discusses implications for entrepreneurial strategy, investor evaluation, and regulatory policy. Section 6 concludes with directions for future research.
