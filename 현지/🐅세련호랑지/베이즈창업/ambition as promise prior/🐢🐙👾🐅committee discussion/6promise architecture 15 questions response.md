# Committee Response to 15 Critical Questions on Promise Architecture Paper

## Bundle 1: Core Framework Questions

### Q1: How do you empirically distinguish between a promise and an experiment?

**Charlie Fine (Operations)**: Operational distinction is clear. Promises create external commitments—supplier contracts, hiring plans, investor expectations. Experiments are internal information-gathering activities.

**Scott Stern (Strategy)**: Every experiment exists within a promise structure. The battery trial only matters because of the broader performance promise. They're nested, not separate.

**Vikash Mansinghka (Computational)**: Promises are public priors shaping stakeholder behavior. Experiments are likelihood functions updating those priors. Entrepreneurs must design both simultaneously.

**Moshe Ben-Akiva (Empirical)**: The distinction is observability. Promises are externally communicated and create commitment. Experiments can remain internal until results emerge.

### Q2: Why should we believe promise architecture is more fundamental than experimentation?

**Scott**: Promises are the context giving experiments meaning. Without the promise frame, an experiment is just random action.

**Charlie**: Every lean startup experiment happens within implicit promises about timeline, resource use, and decision criteria.

**Vikash**: The promise architecture determines which experiments are worth running—it's the prior that shapes the value of information.

### Q3: What's the boundary between promise management and fraud?

**Charlie**: Intentionality. Holmes knew Theranos couldn't deliver—fraud. Musk believed in FSD timelines—aggressive promise architecture.

**Vikash**: Intentionality is unobservable. Better: fraudulent promises have no verification pathway; legitimate promises build staged verification.

**Scott**: The boundary is verifiability intention. Promise architects build paths to verification; fraudsters never intend to verify.

### Q4: Can you prove causality or is this survivor bias?

**Moshe**: We're not claiming promises cause success—we're identifying boundary conditions. Ventures violating these have zero paths to success.

**Scott**: Like thermodynamic limits—you can't violate them and succeed. It's not causality but impossibility theorems.

**Vikash**: The statistical argument: promise architecture predicts outcome variance better than traditional metrics. Superior predictive power, not pure causality.

### Q5: How does this relate to existing signaling theory?

**Vikash**: Signaling reveals fixed information. Promise architecture designs information that doesn't yet exist—it's generative, not revelatory.

**Scott**: Signaling assumes separating equilibria. We're modeling pooling situations where promises create rather than reveal reality.

### Q6: Why two paradoxes and not three or one?

**Charlie**: Empirically grounded—every failed venture violates one or both. Adding more would be theoretical decoration without practical value.

**Scott**: They're orthogonal dimensions. Ambition affects resource mobilization; specification affects adaptability. They interact but don't reduce.

**Moshe**: Mathematically, 2×2 design space is tractable. Three paradoxes create 8 regions—too complex for practical application.

## Bundle 2: Scope and Application Questions

### Q7: Does this apply equally to B2B and B2C ventures?

**Charlie**: B2B tolerates higher precision—contracts lock in relationships. Foxconn-Apple specifications are protected by switching costs.

**Scott**: But B2B demands higher initial precision. Can't get Fortune 500 contracts with "roughly better performance."

**Vikash**: Key difference is feedback loops. B2B has fewer, high-stakes signals. B2C has many weak signals requiring lower initial precision.

**Moshe**: B2B optimal: higher initial τ, slower increase. B2C: lower initial τ, faster increase as signals accumulate.

### Q8: How do cultural differences affect optimal promise architecture?

**Scott**: Silicon Valley optimizes for low precision, high ambition. German Mittelstand for high precision, moderate ambition.

**Charlie**: Culture affects parameters, not framework. Japanese ventures might target τ=25 where Americans target τ=10, but same constraints apply.

**Vikash**: Cultural mismatch in promise architecture might explain international expansion failures—fascinating empirical opportunity.

### Q9: What about ventures that succeeded despite violating your framework?

**Moshe**: Show me one that succeeded with high ambition AND high precision without pivoting.

**Charlie**: SpaceX landing rockets—specific promise, revolutionary achievement.

**Scott**: But they didn't start there! Early SpaceX promised "reduce launch costs," not "land first stage on drone ship."

**Vikash**: Even exceptions follow our framework, just compressed timescales.

### Q10: How do competitive dynamics affect promise choices?

**Scott**: Competition forces higher ambition for differentiation, but uncertainty demands lower specification. That tension drives strategy.

**Charlie**: Unless competing on reliability. FedEx succeeded with extreme precision—"absolutely, positively overnight."

**Vikash**: But that was after establishing capability. Initial FedEx promise was "faster delivery," not specific guarantees.

**Moshe**: Competition may force suboptimal promise architecture, explaining higher failure rates in competitive markets.

### Q11: Is there a temporal sequence to managing paradoxes?

**Moshe**: Always: optimize ambition based on complexity, minimize initial precision, increase through verification.

**Charlie**: Sometimes regulatory requirements force high initial precision. Biotech can't be vague about clinical endpoints.

**Scott**: That's forced precision, not chosen. Even biotech maintains flexibility where possible—endpoints specified, manufacturing flexible.

### Q12: How does this relate to strategic ambiguity literature?

**Scott**: Strategic ambiguity assumes choice. We show ambiguity is often forced by paradox structure—it's optimal, not opportunistic.

**Vikash**: Eisenberg's strategic ambiguity is about managing diverse stakeholders. Promise architecture is about managing future uncertainty.

**Charlie**: We're explaining when strategic ambiguity works versus when it fails—adding precision to a fuzzy concept.

## Bundle 3: Measurement and Implementation

### Q13: What's the unit of analysis—venture, product, or promise?

**Charlie**: Any resource mobilization claim—venture-level, product-level, or feature-level.

**Scott**: The framework scales. Tesla's overall architecture contains sub-architectures for Autopilot, battery tech, manufacturing.

**Vikash**: Fractal structure—same principles apply at every level of granularity.

### Q14: How do you measure learning capacity prospectively?

**Vikash**: Survey stakeholder confidence intervals. Wide intervals indicate preserved learning capacity.

**Charlie**: Measure promise variability in communications over time. Static promises indicate low capacity.

**Moshe**: Count pivot options explicitly preserved—"we may adjust based on learnings" signals maintained capacity.

**Scott**: Triangulate all three measures for robustness.

### Q15: Can established firms use this framework?

**Charlie**: Every innovation project is a promise architecture problem. Google Glass failed from premature precision.

**Scott**: Corporate ventures face additional constraints—brand risk, stakeholder expectations—but same principles apply.

**Vikash**: Actually easier for corporations—they can run multiple promise architectures in parallel, diversifying risk.

**Moshe**: The framework explains why corporate innovation usually fails—they over-specify to satisfy internal stakeholders.

## Committee Consensus

**All Members**: Promise architecture doesn't replace experimentation—it reveals the hidden structure within which experimentation occurs. The contribution is showing that promise design determines what can be learned, not just what is communicated.

### Key Takeaway for Revision
Focus on promise architecture as the **context for experimentation** rather than its replacement. This addresses the fundamental concern while strengthening the theoretical contribution.
