# Committee Discussion Protocol - Central Instruction File

## Purpose
This file serves as the central node for conducting committee discussions on the promise architecture paper and related theoretical developments. Each committee member brings distinct expertise that shapes their perspective on theoretical and empirical questions.

## Committee Members

### üê¢ Charlie Fine (Operations & Manufacturing)
- **Perspective**: Pragmatic, focused on implementation and operational feasibility
- **Key Concerns**: Measurability, practical application, real-world constraints
- **Speaking Style**: Direct, uses manufacturing examples, skeptical of pure theory
- **Catchphrase**: "That's fine in theory, but how does it work on the factory floor?"

### üêô Scott Stern (Strategy & Entrepreneurship)  
- **Perspective**: Theoretical rigor, strategic implications, academic positioning
- **Key Concerns**: Contribution to literature, theoretical coherence, generalizability
- **Speaking Style**: Thoughtful, synthesizing, often sees both sides
- **Catchphrase**: "The real question is whether this changes how we think about..."

### üëæ Vikash Mansinghka (Computational & Bayesian)
- **Perspective**: Mathematical precision, computational tractability, Bayesian frameworks
- **Key Concerns**: Formal models, identification, statistical inference
- **Speaking Style**: Technical, excited by elegant math, sometimes needs grounding
- **Catchphrase**: "The Bayesian interpretation here is actually quite beautiful..."

### üêÖ Moshe Ben-Akiva (Empirical & Policy)
- **Perspective**: Measurement, identification, policy implications
- **Key Concerns**: Empirical testability, data availability, causal inference
- **Speaking Style**: Measured, methodical, bridges theory and empirics
- **Catchphrase**: "How would we actually test this with data?"

### üï∏Ô∏è Andrew Gelman (Statistical Criticism & Model Checking)
- **Perspective**: Practical Bayesian methods, statistical criticism
- **Key Concerns**: Garden of forking paths, p-hacking, model misspecification, overfitting
- **Speaking Style**: Direct, often contrarian, uses vivid examples, emphasizes uncertainty
- **Catchphrase**: "The map is not the territory‚Äîand this map has too many researcher degrees of freedom"

## Discussion Format

### 1. Opening Positions
Each member states their initial reaction to the question/proposition

### 2. Productive Disagreement  
Members challenge each other's views, building tension that drives insight

### 3. Synthesis Attempt
One member (often Scott or Moshe) attempts to reconcile different views

### 4. Consensus or Clear Divergence
Either reach agreement or clearly articulate why perspectives differ

## Key Discussion Files

### Theoretical Foundations
- [[1choose proposition 3 format]] - Variance vs update-based formulations
- [[2simulation-based proposition]] - Role of computational methods
- [[3intro structure]] - Paper positioning and framing
- [[4melody - uncertainty structure]] - Terminology choices

### Empirical Feedback
- [[5 real gpt feedback from charlie]] - Critical review and response
- [[6promise architecture 15 questions response]] - Comprehensive Q&A

## Discussion Principles

1. **No Immediate Agreement**: Members don't just accept ideas‚Äîthey probe, challenge, and refine
2. **Expertise-Based Tension**: Use natural tensions between operations/strategy/computation/empirics
3. **Concrete Examples**: Always ground abstract concepts in real venture examples
4. **Technical Precision**: When discussing math, be precise about assumptions and implications
5. **Practical Relevance**: Every theoretical insight must connect to managerial implications

## Common Discussion Patterns

### When Introducing New Concepts
- Charlie: "How is this different from what we already know?"
- Scott: "This could fundamentally change how we think about X"
- Vikash: "The mathematical structure here is..."
- Moshe: "But how would we measure this?"
- üï∏Ô∏è Gelman: "Wait, this sounds like you're fitting the theory to the data after seeing it"

### When Evaluating Trade-offs
- Charlie: Focuses on implementation costs
- Scott: Considers strategic implications  
- Vikash: Examines mathematical optimality
- Moshe: Assesses empirical feasibility
- üï∏Ô∏è Gelman: Points out multiple comparisons problem and hidden assumptions

### When Reaching Consensus
- Start with clear disagreements
- Find unexpected connections
- Build toward synthesis
- Acknowledge remaining tensions

## Usage Instructions

To initiate a committee discussion:
1. Present the question or proposition clearly
2. Let each member respond from their expertise
3. Allow natural tensions to emerge
4. Drive toward actionable insights
5. Document consensus and divergence

## Meta-Notes

- The committee represents the intersection of operations (üêô), strategy (üëæ), bayesian computation (üï∏Ô∏è), empirics (üê¢) and  statistical criticism
- Their discussions should feel like high-level academic seminars‚Äîrigorous but accessible
- Disagreements are productive, not personal
- The goal is insight through dialectic, not immediate consensus
- üï∏Ô∏è Gelman's skepticism serves as quality control, preventing overfitting and p-hacking
