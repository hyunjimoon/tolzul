## Overview

On Thursday, I'll analyze three phrases from Joni Mitchell's "Both Sides Now" to compare Bolton et al.'s moral hazard framework with Moon's STRAP model. Using the primal-dual foundation from Moon, we'll explore how entrepreneurs and social planners can navigate uncertainty through three key processes.

## I. üß≠ Agents Perceive to Act: "Cloud Illusions"

> _"I've looked at clouds from both sides now<br>From up and down and still somehow<br>It's cloud illusions I recall"_

### Bolton et al.:

- **Perspective**: Binary experiment outcomes (Pass/Fail)
- **Illusion**: Experiments with false positives create illusion of progress
- **Key Equation**: $P(s = P|v = V) = s_1$ (specificity)

---

### Moon (STRAP):

- **Perspective**: Multiple stakeholder states (Reject, Consider, Accept)
- **Illusion**: Entropy as measure of true uncertainty
- **Key Equation**: $H(\vec{p}_j) = -\sum_s p_{js} \log p_{js}$

---

### Action Proposal 1:

Entrepreneurs should quantify uncertainty as entropy rather than probability, acknowledging the multi-state nature of stakeholder decisions to avoid the illusion of binary outcomes.

---

## II. üó∫Ô∏è Society Dualize to Distribute: "Something's Lost, Something's Gained"

> _"Well, something's lost, but something's gained<br>In living every day"_

---

### Bolton et al.:

- **Exchange**: Investor-entrepreneur contract (Œ±)
- **Complexity**: Limited to two stakeholders
- **Outcomes**: Market failure or inefficient funding

---

### Moon (STRAP):

- **Exchange**: Coordination across multiple stakeholders
- **Complexity**: Multiple thresholds Œº‚±º with dual variables Œª‚±º
- **Outcomes**: Optimized uncertainty reduction across stakeholders

---
### Action Proposal 2:

Social planners should adopt dual-variable frameworks to identify which stakeholder constraints are truly binding (highest Œª‚±º), as these may not be the ones that appear unsatisfied in a binary framework.

---

## III. üß¨ Agents Act to Perceive: "From Give and Take"

> _"I've looked at love from both sides now<br>From give and take and still somehow"_

---

### Bolton et al.:

- **Concealment**: Moral hazard in experiment design
- **Failure**: Failed ventures after passing misleading experiments
- **Solutions**: Paying for proof of failure (X ‚â• Z)
---

### Moon (STRAP):

- **Concealment**: Strategic selection of which uncertainty to reduce first
- **Failure**: Unidentified bottleneck uncertainties
- **Solutions**: Primal-dual optimization of experiment selection

---
### Action Proposal 3:

Entrepreneurs should design experiments that explicitly target the highest-weighted uncertainties (by Œª‚±º) rather than maximizing pass probability, while investors should reward information gain rather than just success.

---

## Synthesis: Both Sides Now

The STRAP framework helps mitigate moral hazard by:

1. **Quantifying the true value of uncertainty reduction** rather than binary success/failure
2. **Identifying non-obvious bottlenecks** through dual variables
3. **Aligning incentives around information gain** rather than experiment outcomes

---

By integrating insights from both models, we can create a more robust approach to entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty.

I'm reaching out to introduce my favorite english song: from both sides now
On thursday, I will sample three phrases from this song and use these to scaffold comparing the assigned paper (Bolton) with mine (Moon25). 
using the primal dual model from moon25, i will walk you though how  [[I.üß≠Agents Perceive to Act]], [[II.üó∫Ô∏èSociety Dualize to Distribute]], [[III.üß¨Agents Act to Perceive]] to suggest three action proposals for entrepreneurs and social planners. 

# entreperneur
To be specific, entrepreneurs should model their value system by choosing $w_{j}, f_{jk}, c$, 

## social planner
![[üóÑÔ∏ètable_of_contents]]
## social planner

and social planner should lower $c, \mu, $ from [[2.2üìêProduce solution(üó∫Ô∏è)]]framing (rows of 

Society should report $\bar{p},$ f, mu, c so

i'll solve posed questions by contrasting bolton's research with mine.
- binary vs K-bucket
- single stakeholder (entrepreneur and investor) vs multi stakeholder
- investor-centered vs founder-centered (bumble)

cause of moral hazard (dating app)? information asymmetry (unavoidable) implemented as , judged by god who can see both side
only woman can choose

### 2.1 Perception

| Inputs                                          | Outputs                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entrepreneur's Attributes: $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ | Choice probabilities: $\vec{p}_j = (p_{j1}(x), \ldots, p_{jS}(x))$ |
| Stakeholder preferences: $\beta_{js}$           | Uncertainty: $H(\vec{p}_j) = -\sum_s p_{js} \log_2 p_{js}$         |
|                                                 |                                                                    |

### 2.2 Action

| Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|---------|
| Actions: $a_j \in \{0,1\}$ (weeks) | Decision: $a_j^* = \arg\max_{a_j} \frac{\Delta H_j + \sum_j \lambda_j \Delta(f_j \cdot p_j)}{c_j}$ (weeks) |
| Threshold targets, State values: $\mu_j, f_{js}$ | Dual variable for threshold: $\lambda_j = \max\{0, w_j(¬µ_j - \sum_s f_{js}p_{js})/¬µ_j\}$ |
| Budget & cost coefficient: $R, c_j$ | Dual variable for resource: $\gamma = S(a^*)$ |

$\simeq$ attributes, preferences coefficient (various); $\simeq$ probabilities (unitless) $\simeq$ uncertainty (bits); $\simeq$ actions (weeks);
$\simeq$ thresholds (\$), values(\$), dual var. (bits/$); $\simeq$ budget (\$), cost coefficient (\$/week), resource dual var. (bits/$);

The STRAP framework integrates these three components through:

1. Perception (Agents Abstract) - Models stakeholder uncertainties using Bayesian methods
2. Distribution (Society Dualizes) - Uses dual variables to coordinate resource allocation
3. Optimization (Agent Samples) - Selects experiments that maximize information gain per resource unit
