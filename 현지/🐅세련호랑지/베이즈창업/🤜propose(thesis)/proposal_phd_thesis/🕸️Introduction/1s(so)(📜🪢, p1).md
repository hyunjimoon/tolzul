### Cluster 5: Bayesian entrepreneurship and Belief-Based Model Constraints calling for S1

Recent advances in entrepreneurial decision-making theory have increasingly adopted Bayesian frameworks that assume entrepreneurs update beliefs rationally given new information. However, these models rest on problematic assumptions about cognitive capacity and belief convergence that fail to capture entrepreneurial reality—not just in terms of financial resources, but critically in terms of computational bandwidth. Gius (2024) demonstrates empirically that disagreement among venture competition judges actually predicts startup success, particularly for unique propositions, directly challenging models that assume belief convergence leads to better outcomes. Furthermore, entrepreneurs systematically deviate from rational behavior due to "innate restricted computational capacities, access to information, and physical constraints". The computational burden of Bayesian updating becomes prohibitive when entrepreneurs must simultaneously model interdependent stakeholder beliefs, calculate conditional probabilities across multiple scenarios, and update these beliefs in real-time—all while managing day-to-day operations. These findings expose a fundamental limitation: belief-based models assume computational resources that entrepreneurs simply don't possess, making them descriptively inaccurate and prescriptively useless.

This computational constraint demands explicit modeling alongside financial constraints to accurately describe phenomena, predict behaviors, and prescribe actions. Lieder and Griffiths (2020) provide the theoretical foundation through resource-rational analysis, which models cognition as "the optimal use of limited computational resources"—a framework that treats cognitive bandwidth as a scarce resource to be allocated optimally, just like capital or time. Under this framework, entrepreneurs' failure to execute optimal Bayesian updating isn't irrational—it's the predictable result of computational resource scarcity. When entrepreneurs face decisions with high complexity and implementation costs, they adaptively switch between causal and effectual logics, demonstrating sophisticated resource allocation rather than cognitive failure. By explicitly modeling computational constraints, we can predict when entrepreneurs will abandon analytical approaches for heuristics, why they focus on observable signals rather than belief distributions, and how they'll sequence actions to minimize cognitive load. STRAP operationalizes this insight by providing threshold-based rules that require only local comparisons rather than global optimization, matching entrepreneurs' actual computational budget.

### Cluster 6: Operations for Entrepreneurs and Integration Gaps calling for S2

While operations management has developed sophisticated tools for inventory control, capacity planning, and process optimization, these remain computationally intractable for entrepreneurs who face severe constraints on both financial and cognitive resources. Fine, Padurean, and Naumov (2022) acknowledge that despite three decades of entrepreneurship papers in POM, the topic remains "a poor stepchild" in OM research, with most tools designed for stable firms with dedicated analytics teams rather than resource-constrained startups where founders juggle multiple roles. The computational burden is staggering: traditional OM optimization requires entrepreneurs to simultaneously model demand distributions, calculate safety stock levels, optimize capacity utilization, and coordinate supply chains—each requiring specialized knowledge and significant processing time. Recent research confirms that "traditional OM methods frequently encounter difficulties in balancing various criteria, including cost, quality, resource utilization, and adaptability," and these difficulties multiply when entrepreneurs lack the computational bandwidth to even formulate the optimization problem correctly [[📜liu25_invent(eff(ops), tools)]].

The integration gap reflects a fundamental mismatch between OM's computational demands and entrepreneurial cognitive reality. Traditional OM assumes not just financial resources for implementation but computational resources for analysis—dedicated staff, specialized software, and time for iterative optimization. In contrast, entrepreneurs operate under what the Lean Startup framework calls "runway"—finite time before failure—while following a "fail fast, fail cheaply" imperative ([[📜sheherd20_vision(integ(academic-practitioner), lean)]]) that precludes extensive analysis. Even when OM tools are simplified for startups, they remain fragmented across different decision domains, requiring entrepreneurs to mentally integrate insights from inventory models, queueing theory, and capacity planning without clear guidance on synthesis. The result is that entrepreneurs lack "prescriptive logic telling founders when and how to act," defaulting to intuition because the computational cost of rigorous analysis exceeds their cognitive budget. STRAP directly addresses this by pre-computing the integration, embedding OM insights into simple threshold rules that require only observable state comparisons. This design choice explicitly recognizes computational constraints as binding, making STRAP not just theoretically sound but cognitively feasible for resource-constrained entrepreneurs.

This approach bridges and contributes to three domains. **First, in operations management (OM),** we extend formal inventory modeling concepts to entrepreneurial decision-making, addressing a gap in which new venture operations have been underrepresented in mainstream OM research (Fine et al., 2022). Casting stakeholder sequencing as an OM problem answers calls for more operations-focused insight into start-up challenges (Zhang et al., 2020; Fine et al., 2022). **Second, in classic entrepreneurship,** which often highlights heuristics, effectuation, and experiential learning, we offer a complementary analytical perspective. Traditional entrepreneurial strategy emphasizes founder heuristics and biases (Busenitz & Barney, 1997) or effectual “means-driven” logic under uncertainty (Sarasvathy, 2001), and popular lean start-up methods stress rapid customer feedback and iteration as a way to learn (Ries, 2011; Blank, 2013). Building on these insights, STRAP provides a more structured, optimization-based lens: akin to how entrepreneurs intuitively juggle stakeholder commitments, our model explicitly computes the optimal sequence of commitments. This aligns with the hypothesis-driven approach to venture development (Eisenmann et al., 2012) and formalizes it in an operations model, complementing recent analytical work on lean start-up experimentation (Camuffo et al., 2020; Yoo et al., 2021). **Third, we contribute to the emerging domain of Bayesian entrepreneurship,** which formalizes how entrepreneurs update beliefs and strategies through sequential experimentation. Recent research views entrepreneurship as a Bayesian process of belief updating and learning (Kerr et al., 2014; Gans et al., 2019), moving beyond classical models that assume fully rational actors with shared priors. STRAP embeds Bayesian logic by modeling how new information – for example, a pilot customer’s reaction or a prototype’s performance – updates the venture’s optimal commitment strategy. In doing so, our framework extends Bayesian entrepreneurship models to operational decisions, showing how entrepreneurs can experiment not only with customers (as in lean start-up trials) but also with supply-side choices as “Bayesian experiments” to learn about capacity or technology constraints (Eisenmann et al., 2012; Kerr et al., 2014).
