## Key Theoretical Integration:

**P-Cluster: Low-Bar Experiment Problem (Gans + Arora)**

- **Gans**: Optimistic entrepreneurs choose low-bar experiments {λ₁, λ₀} = {1, Λ-1} - "easy to pass"
- **Arora**: "Entrepreneurs are more optimistic... they ought to favor low-bar experiments"
- **Connection**: Single stakeholder acceptance = low-bar experiment with high false positive rates

**CN-Cluster: Entrepreneurial Overconfidence (Arora + Modrak)**

- **Arora**: "Entrepreneurs are more optimistic about prospects of their venture, for otherwise they would not have started"
- **Modrak**: Parameter-only validation misses data-ignoring models
- **Connection**: Overconfident entrepreneurs accept single-stakeholder validation too easily

**CS-Cluster: High-Bar Experiment Design Need (Gans + Camuffo)**

- **Gans**: Skeptical investors prefer high-bar experiments {λ₁, λ₀} = {Λ-1, 1} - "hard to pass"
- **Camuffo**: Scientific entrepreneurs trained to form theories have higher quit rates but better performance
- **Connection**: Dual stakeholder acceptance = high-bar experiment design

**SO-Cluster: Systematic Validation Training (Arora + Yu)**

- **Arora**: "Scientific Entrepreneurs that persist outperform the control group entrepreneurs that persist"
- **Yu**: "Startups in accelerators are more likely to quit than comparable firms"
- **Connection**: Proper validation training increases appropriate abandonment of non-scalable ventures

## Updated Literature Integration:

The validation theory now explicitly connects:

1. **Gans' experiment design theory** → Single vs dual stakeholder validation
2. **Arora's Bayesian entrepreneurship** → Optimism bias in validation choice
3. **Modrak's SBC theory** → Multi-dimensional testing completeness
4. **Camuffo's scientific entrepreneurship** → Training effects on validation quality

This creates a cohesive theoretical foundation linking information design, Bayesian entrepreneurship, and computational validation to dual stakeholder acceptance theory.
