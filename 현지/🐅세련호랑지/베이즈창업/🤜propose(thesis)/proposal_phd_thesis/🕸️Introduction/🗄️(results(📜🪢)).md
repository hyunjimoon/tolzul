### 1‚ÄÇWhy a **Customer-Focus** venture must grow _PR_ faster than _CR_

Optimality in the upper-left quadrant requires the inequality $\color{violet}{\textstyle PR\;>\;CR.}$

Both ratios change as the firm scales: **PR** rises or falls with stakeholder excitement, whereas **CR** drifts with the economics of stock-outs versus slack. A customer-centric firm earns its edge from _speed-to-demand_; once customers queue up, partners tend to follow. If **CR** (mismatch cost pressure) outruns **PR** (stakeholder eagerness), the firm crosses the 45¬∞ frontier into danger territory where over- or under-commitment erodes margins. **Intuition:**

- Customer moves first ‚Üí revenue visibility cushions inventory risk.
- Therefore the _acceptance gradient_ must stay steeper than the _mismatch-cost gradient_; i.e., grow **PR** at least as fast as‚Äîor preferably faster than‚Äî**CR**.

### 2‚ÄÇWhy a **Resource-Focus** venture must grow _CR_ faster than _PR_

For capability-first plays the condition flips: $\color{green}{\textstyle PR\;<\;CR.}$

These startups sink capital before demand is proven; their safety margin comes from making shortage losses (Cu)(C_u) loom larger than excess capacity (Co)(C_o). If customer buzz expands **PR** faster than management raises **CR**, the firm slips into the customer zone with heavy fixed assets still on the books‚Äîclassic over-commitment risk. **Intuition:**

- Partner moves first ‚Üí scale, learning, and cost dominance are the moat.
- Maintaining that moat requires the _mismatch-cost gradient_ to outrun any rise in partner or customer enthusiasm.

**Three-Paragraph Summary**

The research report explores how vertical integration decisions influence a startup's strategic positioning within a 2x2 framework defined by a Probability Ratio (PR) and a Critical Ratio (CR). It analyzes academic literature to understand how different rationales for vertical integration shift a startup's focus between customer utility (UC‚Äã), resource partner utility (URP‚Äã), understocking costs (Cu‚Äã), and overstocking costs (Co‚Äã), thereby triggering one of four canonical strategic "moves." Key insights are drawn from studies on product complexity, strategic supplier interactions, and volume uncertainty, each illustrating distinct pathways through which vertical integration impacts the PR and CR axes.

Specifically, integrating to manage high product complexity, as suggested by Novak and Eppinger (2001), tends to increase customer utility (UC‚Äã), thereby decreasing PR and leading to a Resource-Focus (Move 3). Conversely, strategic outsourcing to a common supplier, even at a premium, as analyzed by Arya et al. (2008), can reduce net utility from that resource partner (URP‚Äã), also decreasing PR and resulting in a Resource-Focus (Move 3) by altering competitive dynamics. These decisions highlight how internal capabilities and competitive maneuvers can reshape a startup's stakeholder orientation. ¬†

Finally, vertical integration in response to volume uncertainty, based on Transaction Cost Economics, primarily affects the Critical Ratio (CR). If integration successfully reduces stock-out costs (Cu‚Äã) more than it increases idle capacity costs (Co‚Äã), CR decreases, leading to a Customer-Focus (Move 4). However, if increased asset intensity leads to dominant idle capacity costs (‚ÜëCo‚Äã), CR increases, shifting towards a Resource-Focus (Move 2). The report also touches upon taper integration as a nuanced strategy for balancing these effects. ¬†

**One-Paragraph Summary**

The research report examines how startups' vertical integration strategies impact their position within a stakeholder-sequencing framework defined by a Probability Ratio (PR) and a Critical Ratio (CR). Analyzing academic literature, it shows that integrating to manage product complexity (Novak & Eppinger, 2001) or strategically outsourcing to influence supplier behavior (Arya et al., 2008) typically decreases PR by affecting customer utility or resource partner utility, respectively, leading to a Resource-Focus (Move 3). Vertical integration to handle volume uncertainty (Transaction Cost Economics) primarily shifts CR, either decreasing it (Customer-Focus, Move 4) by lowering stock-out costs or increasing it (Resource-Focus, Move 2) if idle capacity costs rise significantly. ¬†
