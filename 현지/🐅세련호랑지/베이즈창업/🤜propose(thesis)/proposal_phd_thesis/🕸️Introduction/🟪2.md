# The coupled decision gaps  
Two interlocking gaps keep this problem unsolved. (i) Predictive gap. Founders struggle to predict how stakeholders will actually respond to incremental quality or timing movesâ€”will another prototype secure a purchase order, or will a supplier soften terms once demand is signalled? (Cachon & Lariviere, 2005; [[ğŸ“œğŸŸ©_mitchell97_identify(stakeholders, salience)]]). (ii) Prescriptive gap. Even if reactions could be forecast, entrepreneurs lack a tractable way to prescribe optimal quality of value proposition which further informs time and cash investment across stakeholder groups ([[ğŸ“œğŸŸ§_kavadias03_sequence(projects,priority)]], [[ğŸ“œğŸŸ§_kavadias02_allocate(dynamic-portfolio,NPD)]]). Prediction without prescription is paralysis; prescription without prediction is blind execution. Contemporary heuristicsâ€”Lean-Startup validation loops ([[camuffo24-theory-driven-strategic-management-decisions.pdf]], [[ğŸ“œğŸŸ§_camuffo19_structure(experiments, learning)]]), effectuation theory ([[ğŸ“œğŸŸ¦_sarasvathy01_leverage(contingencies, uncertainty)]]), or capability-centred operations advice (Fine et al., 2022)â€”tackle fragments of either gap but never fuse the two. This fragmentation proves costly: 42% of startups fail can be interpreted as quality-commitment mismatches ([[ğŸ“œğŸŸª_cb18_validate(demand, before-scaling)]]), as entrepreneurs resort to trial-and-error ([[ğŸ“œğŸŸ§_kerr14_systematize(experimentation, entrepreneurship)]]) or learn from samples of one ([[ğŸ“œğŸŸª_march91_extract(organizations, small-histories)]]).
