### 1.2 Literature Foundations

Fine et al. (2022) architectured multiple operational tools and systematically weaved them with entrepreneurial decision cases but didn‚Äôt provide instructions on why, how, and when entrepreneurs should use each tool. Bayesian entrepreneurship oÔ¨Äers a quantitative lens to entrepreneurial decision making (Agrawal et al., 2024; CamuÔ¨Äo et al., 2024), but unsettled confusion of the Ô¨Åeld on normative and positive approaches, makes the usefulness of model questionable. Frameworks like the Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), Lean Startup (Ries, 2011; Eisenmann et al., 2012), articulate hypotheses without systematic updating but is not dynamic enough to capture feedbacks and don‚Äôt provide decision making rule under uncertainty with constrained resource. Strategy research proposes some dynamic stopping rules (Gans et al., 2019; Chavda et al., 2024) but lacks integration with resource rationality Bhui et al. (2021) or cognitive developments Ullman and Tenenbaum (2020).

STRAP aims to Ô¨Åll these gaps. Section 2 details the STRAP framework and mathematical formulations for both modules. Section 3 presents a comparative case study of STRAP guided vs. non-guided trajectories. Section 4 discusses implications for operations, strategy, and real options theory.
## 4 Discussion

STRAP not only bridges multiple stakeholders (customer, operations partner, investor) and methods (inference and optimization) but also academic domains (operations, strategy, Ô¨Ånance). This is not surprising given entrepreneurial decision making‚Äôs universality.

4.1 Connections to Entrepreneurial Operations

STRAP aligns with (Fine et al., 2022)‚Äôs work on avoiding "naked scaling" by introducing structured operational processes. While Fine et al. propose ten scaling tools (e.g., processiÔ¨Åcation), STRAP complements this by quantifying which tool to deploy Ô¨Årst based on uncertainty reduction. Their observation that ventures adopt "capability-Ô¨Årst" or "customer-Ô¨Årst" modes is captured in STRAP through adjustable stakeholder weights (w j ) and initial states (S 0 ), enabling personalized, contextaware recommendations. This addresses the technical challenge of adaptive guidance raised in the introduction, oÔ¨Äering long-term utility as ventures transition between operational modes during scaling.

4.2 Synergy with Entrepreneurial Strategy

Gans et al. (2019)‚Äôs recommendation for explore-exploit stopping rule in entrepreneurial settings is called ‚ÄúTest two choose one,‚Äù providing insight that multiple equally viable alternatives exist (especially for high-quality ideas). STRAP speciÔ¨Åes this multiplicity as multiple stakeholders and actions targeting to lower their uncertainty, formalizing the trade-oÔ¨Ä between learning and commitment through the dual variable of resource constraint Œ≥ . When the value of additional tests falls below Œ≥ , STRAP triggers commitment‚Äìa quantitative enhancement to Gans et al.‚Äôs qualitative stopping rule. Interpreting resource constraint axiom from their paper as constraining one action per timestep (Œ£a j = 1) Equation 6 provides stopping rule. It‚Äôd be interesting to explore their connection to unify j diÔ¨Äerent perspectives on sequential versus parallel actions in entrepreneurship (Dow et al., 2010; Ott and Eisenhardt, 2020).

4.3 Real Options Theory for Entrepreneur-centered Ô¨Ånancing

STRAP advances entrepreneur‚Äôs usability of real options theory by synthesizing it with three established theories. First, using ABSTRACTION principle from model developing theory (Tenenbaum

9 et al., 2011; Bernstein, 2023), STRAP explicitly models interdependencies among multiple stakeholders. Its abstracted mapping between observable venture attributes and stakeholders‚Äô choice probability in perception module enables actions targeted to one stakeholder to be spilled over to increase the acceptance probability of others. Uber‚Äôs strategy to focus on customer popularity eventually eased regulatory approval and incentivized driver participation. STRAP can capture the tradeoÔ¨Ä on the number of stakeholder (J): maintaining a larger value grid (size JK) increases computational costs but creates more options. This advances traditional real option theory where risk is analyzed in isolation.

Second, using DUALITY from optimization theory Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004); Schrijver (1998), it replaces static thresholds with a dynamic primal-dual optimization framework that continuously recalculates the cost-beneÔ¨Åt tradeoÔ¨Ä of experiments through shadow prices Œ≥ , leveraging primal-dual convergence to enable adaptive scaling as uncertainties evolve.

Through AGENCY, STRAP models stakeholders‚Äô commitment states (reject, consider, accept), positioning entrepreneurs at the center of decision-making rather than as passive recipients of investor preferences, enabling multiple paths to success through active coordination of stakeholder commitments. This approach diÔ¨Äers signiÔ¨Åcantly from the investor-led experimentation paradigm described by Nanda (2024), which emphasizes staged, investor-driven learning as the primary mechanism for uncertainty reduction. Instead, STRAP recognizes that successful ventures require coordinated uncertainty resolution across all key stakeholders simultaneously, with entrepreneur at the center and investor as one stakeholder.

The key difference is that Bolton et al. focus on a principal-agent framework with moral hazard in experiment design, while Moon's STRAP framework focuses on uncertainty reduction across multiple stakeholders without addressing moral hazard. Bolton uses probability variables to model experiment information content, while Moon uses information-theoretic entropy to quantify uncertainty.
