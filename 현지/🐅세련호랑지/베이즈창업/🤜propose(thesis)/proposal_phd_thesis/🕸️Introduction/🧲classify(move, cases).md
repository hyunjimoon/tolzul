- using [[🧲classify(evangelist, 📜)]]
My classification framework maps a startup’s stakeholder-sequencing decisions onto a 2 × 2 matrix with:

  • Probability Ratio (PR) on the vertical axis  
     PR = e^{U_RP}/(e^{U_RP}+e^{U_C})

  • Critical Ratio (CR) on the horizontal axis  
     CR = C_u / (C_u + C_o)

The four canonical “moves” that relocate a venture across quadrants are:

  ⬆️ Move 1 (increase PR) … ↑U_RP or ↓U_C → lands in Customer-Focus  
  ➡️ Move 2 (increase CR) … ↑C_u or ↓C_o → lands in Resource-Focus  
  ⬇️ Move 3 (decrease PR) … ↓U_RP or ↑U_C → lands in Resource-Focus  
  ⬅️ Move 4 (decrease CR) … ↓C_u or ↑C_o → lands in Customer-Focus  

**How vertical integration might shift the axes**

| Mechanism of integration | Likely axis effect |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Tighter quality / faster response | ↑ U_C  ⇒ PR ↓ (Move 3) |
| Lock-in of upstream rents | ↓ U_RP ⇒ PR ↓ (Move 3) |
| Flexibility lowers stock-out pain | ↓ C_u ⇒ CR ↓ (Move 4) |
| Asset intensity raises idle-capacity cost | ↑ C_o ⇒ CR ↑ (Move 2) |

**Task for each paper**

1. Summarise its main argument about startup vertical integration.  
2. Identify which axis (PR or CR) the integration chiefly shifts and in which direction (↑ or ↓).  
3. Conclude with the corresponding canonical move number (1-4) and a one-line rationale.

Return your answer as a table: *Paper | Key insight | Axis shifted | Direction | Move # | Rationale*.
