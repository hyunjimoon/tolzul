# Abstract Versions

## 1. Supply-Development Focus (for Charlie Fine and Moshe Ben-Akiva)

**Abstract: Entrepreneurial Decision Model with Phase-Based Operational Uncertainty Reduction**

This thesis develops an operational framework for entrepreneurial decision-making that minimizes uncertainty rather than maximizing utility. We introduce a structured approach to sequence critical operational actions (Collaborate, Segment, Capitalize) based on their uncertainty reduction efficiency across venture development phases. Using state transition modeling, we demonstrate how different action sequences create distinct uncertainty reduction paths, allowing entrepreneurs to optimize resource allocation. Our model integrates operations management principles with discrete choice modeling to create actionable decision tools that adapt to different venture phases. Case studies in mobility ventures validate our approach, showing how entrepreneurs can systematically reduce operational uncertainties while respecting resource constraints. This work bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation, providing entrepreneurs with structured methods to navigate complex decision environments.

## 2. Demand-Development Focus (for Scott Stern and Jinhua Zhao)

**Abstract: Bayesian Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Under Multi-Stakeholder Uncertainty**

This thesis develops a Bayesian approach to entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on how entrepreneurs can systematically reduce demand-side uncertainty through strategic action sequencing. We formulate entrepreneurial decisions as uncertainty minimization problems where stakeholder preferences and initial venture states determine optimal action paths. The model accounts for how different actions (Collaborate, Segment, Capitalize) affect stakeholder uncertainties and demonstrates that market-focused actions early in the venture lifecycle can dramatically improve efficiency. Our empirical analysis of mobility ventures validates the model's predictive power for understanding entrepreneurial choices and outcomes. This work contributes to entrepreneurship theory by providing a mathematically rigorous framework for analyzing the previously tacit knowledge of uncertainty reduction, while offering practical guidance for entrepreneurs navigating complex market environments.

## 3. Technical Implementation Focus (for Vikash Mansinghka)

**Abstract: Probabilistic Programming for Entrepreneurial Decision Support Under Uncertainty**

This thesis develops a probabilistic programming approach to entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty. We formulate entrepreneurial choices as sequential decisions aimed at minimizing weighted uncertainties across demand, supply, and investor dimensions. Our model leverages advanced probabilistic programming techniques to represent the state transition dynamics between different uncertainty states based on entrepreneurial actions. We demonstrate how this approach enables entrepreneurs to reason systematically about complex decision spaces, accounting for resource constraints and stakeholder preferences. Implementation using probabilistic programming allows for efficient simulation of alternative action sequences and their uncertainty reduction effects. Case studies in mobility ventures showcase how different initial conditions and preference weights lead to distinct optimal action sequences. This work bridges theoretical entrepreneurship models with computational decision support tools, providing a foundation for AI-assisted entrepreneurial decision-making.



# 1.2üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàComplexity Spectrum of Entrepreneurial Decision Models

## Progressive Spectrum of Model Complexity

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models becomes evident when examining the progressive spectrum of model complexity:

|Model Type|Temporal Complexity|Spatial Complexity|Tractability|Reality Fit|Need for New Approach|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Strategy-Only, Single Stakeholder**|Low|Low|High|Poor|‚ùå No|
|**Strategy + Time Steps, Single Stakeholder**|Medium|Low|Medium-High|Moderate|‚¨áÔ∏è Low|
|**Strategy + Multi-Stakeholder (Static)**|Low|Medium|Medium|Moderate|‚¨ÜÔ∏è Medium|
|**Strategy + Operations + Multi-Stakeholder (Dynamic)**|High|High|Low|High|‚úÖ Yes|
|**Full Operational Scaling + Multi-Stakeholder**|Very High|Very High|Very Low|Very High|üö® Critical|

As temporal complexity (uncertainty unfolding over time) and spatial complexity (number of interacting stakeholders/variables) increase, the model better represents reality but becomes increasingly intractable. At the highest complexity levels‚Äîprecisely where real entrepreneurial decisions exist‚Äîtraditional models become unusable.
- **Temporal Complexity** = How much uncertainty unfolds over time.
- **Spatial Complexity** = How many stakeholders/variables interact.
- **Reality Fit** = How closely the model matches real entrepreneurial conditions.
- **Need for New Approach** for integrated phase-based learning + + calibrated federated learning


## Three-Dimensional Complexity Analysis

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models stems from three interconnected dimensions of complexity:

1. **System Design Issues**: The fundamental tractability-reality tradeoff creates structural barriers to model adoption, as evidenced by the progression from strategy-only to operational-scaling EDMs.
    
2. **Individual Cognitive Barriers**: Entrepreneurs face overwhelming cognitive load attempting to infer both their own preferences and stakeholder responses, leading to ineffective causal reasoning about multi-dimensional decision spaces.
    
3. **Institutional Coordination Gaps**: Misalignment between entrepreneur pace and institutional/societal evolution creates temporal uncertainty that compounds with spatial complexity, particularly when ventures require coordination with broader ecosystem stakeholders.
    

## Toward Integrated Solutions

This thesis proposes that entrepreneurial decision models can become usable through three integrated solutions that address these complexity dimensions:

1. **Phase-based learning** to address temporal complexity through modularized approaches that adapt to different venture development stages
2. **Proactive hypothesis proposal** to address spatial complexity through probabilistic programming that navigates stakeholder interdependencies
3. **Calibrated federated learning** to address spatio-temporal complexity through entrepreneur-social planner coordination

The challenge of making entrepreneurial decision models usable isn't just academic‚Äîit directly impacts innovation capacity, resource efficiency, and entrepreneurial success rates across the economy. By developing frameworks that balance complexity and tractability while maintaining reality fit, we can bridge the theory-practice gap and empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

### üéØ Why this structure works:

- Quickly shows that as we move **right ‚Üí**, reality fit increases but **tractability collapses**.
- Builds intuitive reason **why smart uncertainty minimization methods** are necessary.
- Shows **where** your methods kick in (middle-high complexity) without overwhelming readers.
    



The table below compares various entrepreneurial decision models, progressing from a simple single-stakeholder strategy to a highly detailed multi-stakeholder operational model. It shows how **temporal complexity** (time/horizon) and **spatial complexity** (breadth of stakeholders/variables) increase along this spectrum, leading to higher dimensionality, reduced tractability, and changes in phenomenological accuracy. At the extreme end, traditional optimization and heuristic methods become insufficient ‚Äì underscoring the need for new approaches like **federated learning** (to manage temporal complexity) and **proactive proposal testing** (to manage spatial complexity).

# 1.3üéûÔ∏èThesis Scope and Example Case

Three interrelated factors contribute to the unusability of current EDMs, each with significant consequences at a different level of analysis. At the fundamental **nature of the problem** level, the inherent trade-off between model tractability and reality-fit means that formal models tend to be either overly simplistic or overwhelmingly complex; consequently, entrepreneurs often **abandon formal modeling** in favor of intuition, imitation, or ad hoc heuristics. At the **individual** level, entrepreneurs‚Äô idiosyncratic initial conditions and the cognitive difficulty of inferring both their own and others‚Äô preferences render one-size-fits-all models ineffective ‚Äì leading individuals to revert to copying others‚Äô strategies and hindering the development of a personalized decision-making style. At the **institutional** level, insufficient modeling education for entrepreneurs and weak coordination between ventures and public stakeholders result in **fragmented, non-cumulative learning** and planning failures on a broader scale. Each of these problem dimensions is examined in depth in Section 2.Nature of problem, Section 4.Individual level of problem, and Section 6.Institutional level of problem, respectively, underscoring the need for new approaches to bridge this usability gap.

To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a three-pronged framework of solutions, summarized in the table below.

Table 1.3 A three-solution framework addressing temporal (<span style="color:red">red</span>), spatial (<span style="color:green">green</span>), and spatio-temporal (<span style="color:violet">violet</span>) complexities in entrepreneurial decision models through phase-based learning, proactive hypothesis testing, and calibrated federated learning approaches.

This table presents a comprehensive framework for addressing key complexities in entrepreneurial decision models through three integrated solutions. The <span style="color:red">red-coded phase-based learning approach</span> tackles temporal complexity by transforming overly simplistic or overly complex strategies into modularized operational models with sub-path formulations. The <span style="color:green">green-coded proactive hypothesis proposal methodology</span> addresses spatial complexity by evolving causal inference into participatory value modeling through probabilistic programming techniques. Finally, the <span style="color:violet">violet-coded calibrated federated learning system</span> combines both temporal and spatial dimensions by replacing unstructured approaches with bounded probability distributions that enable dynamic consistency through milestone-based coordination between entrepreneurs and social planners. Together, these color-coded solutions form a robust toolkit for enhancing model usability across the different complexity dimensions of entrepreneurial decision-making.

## SOL

## FULFILLMENT
from moshe_benAkiva
- you mentioned "1.Experimental (proactive)" is impractical or infeasible, but this is very usual in entrepreneurship where previous collected data hints the next experiment. I believe ultimate outcome of every model should be an action that triggers data based on which next action is chosen. Incidentally I don't trust any data collected by others (measurement issues) so my preference is experimental > hypothetical > observational

##  Operational Partner Decision Matrix ($B_o$)

This matrix maps observable startup attributes to partnership decisions for material testing facilities, construction material suppliers, and other operational partners.

|Observable Attribute|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Decision Impact (0-1)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Technical Performance**|Unproven|Lab validated|Field validated|0.9|
|**Manufacturing Readiness**|Theoretical process|Working prototype|Scalable process|0.8|
|**Compliance with Standards**|Non-compliant|Partially compliant|Fully compliant|0.9|
|**Integration Complexity**|Major changes needed|Moderate adaptation|Drop-in replacement|0.7|
|**Market Demand Signals**|Speculative|Early adopter interest|Confirmed demand|0.6|
|**Financial Stability**|Pre-seed funding|Major funding secured|Revenue generating|0.5|
|**IP Protection**|Provisional patents|Filed patents|Granted patents|0.4|
|**Partnership Terms**|Exclusive license|Joint development|Open collaboration|0.3|

**Partnership Decision Function:** $P(Partner) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Attribute_i - \theta)$

Where:

- $w_i$ is the Decision Impact weight for attribute $i$
- $\theta$ is the partnership threshold (currently 3.0)
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

**Sublime's Current Position (May 2025):**

- Technical Performance: Level 2 (Lab validated, first commercial application)
- Manufacturing Readiness: Level 2 (Working prototype at pilot scale)
- Compliance with Standards: Level 2 (Partially compliant with ASTM standards)
- Integration Complexity: Level 3 (Claimed to be drop-in replacement)
- Market Demand Signals: Level 2 (Early adopter interest from eco-builders)
- Financial Stability: Level 2 (DOE funding secured)
- IP Protection: Level 2 (Patent applications filed)
- Partnership Terms: Level 3 (Open collaboration model)

**Current $P(Partner)$ = 0.68**

| **Regulatory Approval**      | Experimental use only | Limited approval       | Full code approval    | 0.9                   |
| **Case Studies/References**  | None                  | Early projects         | Multiple references   | 0.6                   |
| **Technical Support**        | Limited               | Standard               | Comprehensive         | 0.4                   |
| **Market Differentiation**   | None                  | Moderate               | Significant           | 0.5                   |

**Purchase Decision Function:** $P(Purchase) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Attribute_i - \theta)$

Where:

- $w_i$ is the Decision Impact weight for attribute $i$
- $\theta$ is the purchase threshold (currently 3.2)
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

**Sublime's Current Position (May 2025):**

- Performance Metrics: Level 2 (Claimed to be equivalent to Portland)
- Cost Premium: Level 1 (Currently >50% higher than Portland)
- ESG Certification Value: Level 3 (Premium "zero-carbon" certification potential)
- Supply Chain Reliability: Level 1 (Unproven at scale)
- Regulatory Approval: Level 2 (Limited approval for non-structural applications)
- Case Studies/References: Level 2 (One Boston Wharf Road project)
- Technical Support: Level 2 (Standard support)
- Market Differentiation: Level 3 (Significant "true zero" carbon claim)

**Current $P(Purchase)$ = 0.56**


## Investor Decision Matrix ($B_i$)

|Observable Attribute|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Decision Impact (0-1)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Testing Facility Approval**|None|Preliminary tests|Full certification|0.7|
|**Production Scale**|Lab scale (<1 ton)|Pilot plant (250 TPY)|Commercial (30,000+ TPY)|0.8|
|**Customer Commitments**|Interest only|Letters of intent|Binding contracts|0.9|
|**Team Experience**|Academic only|Academic + startup|Industry veterans|0.6|
|**Regulatory Status**|Unknown|Under review|Approved for construction|0.8|
|**Capital Requirements**|>$200M|$87-200M|<$87M|0.5|
|**Carbon Reduction**|<50%|50-80%|>80%|0.4|
|**Production Cost**|>2x Portland|1.3-2x Portland|‚â§1.3x Portland|0.7|

**Investment Decision Function:** $P(Invest) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Attribute_i - \theta)$

Where:

- $w_i$ is the Decision Impact weight for attribute $i$
- $\theta$ is the investment threshold (currently 2.5)
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

**Sublime's Current Position (May 2025):**

- Testing Facility Approval: Level 2 (Preliminary tests completed)
- Production Scale: Level 2 (250 TPY pilot plant)
- Customer Commitments: Level 2 (Letters of intent for 45,000 tons)
- Team Experience: Level 3 (Founded by MIT researchers with industry connections)
- Regulatory Status: Level 2 (DOE funding secured, permitting in progress)
- Capital Requirements: Level 2 ($87M from DOE, additional private investment needed)
- Carbon Reduction: Level 3 (>90% reduction claimed)
- Production Cost: Level 1 (Currently >2x Portland cement)

**Current $P(Invest)$ = 0.73**


## Interpretation and Strategy Implications

These decision matrices reveal Sublime Systems' key strategic challenges:

1. **Investors** are most likely to engage (P=0.73) due to strong climate tech interest, but are concerned about production costs and capital requirements.
    
2. **Operational Partners** show moderate engagement likelihood (P=0.68), with technical validation and standards compliance being critical barriers.
    
3. **Customers** have the lowest current engagement probability (P=0.56), primarily constrained by cost premium, supply chain reliability, and regulatory approval.
    

The optimal strategy involves:

1. **Sequential Validation**: First focus on improving technical validation and reducing production costs to strengthen operational partner relationships.
    
2. **Proactive Testing**: Simultaneously engage early-adopter customers with strong ESG priorities to build case studies while production scales.
    
3. **Dynamic Calibration**: Shift focus from technical validation to cost reduction and supply reliability as production scales, to broaden customer adoption beyond early adopters.
    

This mathematical approach identifies actionable priorities for Sublime Systems while balancing the interdependent stakeholder concerns in the conservative construction materials industry.

### five abstracts -> three abstracts
motivation: exchanging influence with investment: making five versions of abstract that each leverages the optimism of each professors - think of this as selfish gene logic where human's nature is to desire for influence (whether biological or spiritual) and invest money, time, effort to satisfy that desire. i.e. my business model is to create and capture value using optimism of the five professors. several success examples is implementing the advice of mentor/investors have increase the startup quality as measured by one research using creative destruction lab venture accelerator database (description attached). using charlie's advice - you want others to feel excited about your research, and the recipe for others to get excited about something is, first find a shared vision (as you go up the ladder of abstraction, you can find shared vision with everyone e.g. from optimism of small scope like entrepreneurship to bigger scope of world peace). then given the shared vision, help them understand what they can contribute to they would find a "how" themselves.

For an EV startup founder, engaging with a diverse array of advisors is crucial for refining their understanding of the complex landscape they navigate. Each conversation sheds light on different facets‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the trajectory of battery technology, the expansion of charging infrastructure, evolving regulatory policies, or patterns in customer adoption. While no single piece of advice may perfectly align with the founder

I met with vikash, charlie said he'd reply to vikash (but not sure he has yet)
moving from compete to collaborate 


f \in F1 vs F2 (F1 < F2)
f(x) - f(x*)

conditional distribution can be competed - cost of commiting to competition?
given that we committed to execution (me): 
given that we committed to control (vikash): 



![[Pasted image 20240410094259.png|200]]
Based on my interaction with each of you, I think we'd make a lovely organization with Artist Scott, judge Charlie, scientist Vikash (from Cronin_SAJ.pdf)

###  2024 July
Last Tuesday Vikash said he can only fund research that¬†is¬†directly¬†aligned with his lab's vision. Not to scare him away, I shared how responsible you have been about my funding and said funding is not my primary goal of¬†approaching him. Without financial constraints, Vikash became more open. We brainstormed how to develop a meditech case and he asked me to deliver meditech's summary by Wednesday so that we can have deeper conversations on Thursday dinner. I stayed up all Tuesday night & Wednesday to deliver¬†this slide, which Vikash was satisfied with.

During Thursday dinner, I met Joshua Tenenbaum (Vikash's advisor) and asked for advice on planning to reach my goal - bridging CHI (Josh and Vikash's¬†Focused Research Organizations and Bayesian Entrepreneurship. I shared my hardship in eliciting¬†active¬†support from you or Vikash due to my lack of communication skill.¬†
He was interested in Bayesian Entrepreneurship and shared his theory on why Vikash might be interested in my research: Reid Hoffman and¬†David Siegel¬†are important CHI's¬†funders (for AGI) so the business use case¬†of CHI's technology would be valuable. Joshua and Vikash have been discussing game theoretic multi agent business strategy tools, which I think would be an extension of tug of war (p.13) from CHI's¬†architecture paper¬†(From Word Models to World Models). Joshua advised connecting these dots for you +¬† having you and Vikash to have a brief chat would be helpful.

After carefully sharing Joshua's advice with Vikash, he thankfully updated his mode of help and gave¬†more actionable advice. We brainstormed how to pitch this project to you. Attached is my first draft which Vikash offered to revise before sharing with you. I'm waiting for his feedback.
 
ai accountant - pitch to charlie (with vikash's help).pdf with case2 on  case2_pivoting and case2_pivoting

charlie's reaction to our `ai accountant project`¬†was being clear on ‚Äúwho is proposing what to whom and what we all hope to contribute and accomplish?‚Äù to choose my doctoral committee member. This requires probabilistic reasoning on  

- why¬†`Vikash`¬†is interested in my research (`joshua`¬† shared important CHI investors are entrepreneurs, so business application can be valuable)
- what¬†`Charlie`¬†meant when he said ‚Äúcan¬†`Vikash`¬†partially fund you‚Äù?
- can¬†`Scott (theorist)`¬†be a reliable distribution channel for our research to entrepreneurship community, than¬†`Bill (practitioner, director of martin trust center)`?

- CONTRANIAN dynamics e.g. no is more informative than yes, can have clearer goal in infecting majority with idea; persuasion -> BRIDGING dynamics (higher quantity leading to higher quantity (Terweich 2015) - evolutionary)
- M3S DIRL team didn't have plans on interpretability. incremental research. 
- angie is betting on charlie's clockspeed and gear model, scott's innovation ecosystem and bayesian entrepreneurship, vikash's probablistic programming language architecture, starting with `ai accountant`  product

#### 2.  PhD goals 
- persuasion between tribes with different language and tool - contributed to convergence of `connectionist`, `symbolist`, `bayesian`
- connectionists, symbolists are being combined on top of Bayesian (as was predicted in the book). Analogizes (learning with kernel; Fourier) and evolutionaries (algorithmic reasoning) are in line to be unified. 
- experience science of scale: need homogenous and visionary organization to scale 
- smooth connection of inference and decision
- stan tribe likes code, sd tribe likes diagram
- probabilistic programming for two markets: i) entrepreneurship education, ii) startup
