1. useful for setting prior and manage expectation of lowbar, but better way is capability pooling (e.g. with my research on promise prior and file management). i) simulating sellability and deliverability before, ii) increasing precision of both during, iii) pooling capability are principles of life. 

* **Class Attendance:** 16 sessions × 1.5hr = 24 hr
* **Recitations:** 3 sessions (alternating with Adam) × 3hr delivery × 2 (prep) = 18 hr
* **Office Hours:** 5 weeks × 1hr = 5 hr
* **Grading:** Split 120 students (~25 teams) with Adam
   * PATA case reports: ~13 submissions × .5hr = 6.5 hr
   * Yedioth case reports: ~13 submissions × .5hr = 6.5 hr
   * Venture pitches: ~13 submissions × .25hr ~ 3.5 hr
   * Simulation reports: ~13 submissions × .5hr = 6.5 hr
   * Final exam: ~60 exams × .33hr = 20 hr
* **Mail response** : 2hrs/w * 5w = 10hr

**Total: 90 hr = 24 (learning) + 23 (teaching) + 43 (grading)  + 10 (mail) over 5 weeks (~20 hours/week)**
