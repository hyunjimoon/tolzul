Q1. Optimizing Weekly Retailer Shipments

To address the challenge of determining weekly shipment quantities for each retailer while
avoiding both stockouts and excessive returns, we employed the Newsvendor model.
Using historical weekly sales data for each of the 50 retailers, we calculated the average
demand (Î¼) and the standard deviation (Ïƒ). To achieve a 99% service level, we used the
following formula:
Order Quantity=Î¼+2.33â‹…Ïƒ
This ensures each retailer receives sufficient inventory to meet demand in 99% of the
weeks, assuming demand is normally distributed. For instance, Retailer 1 had an average
weekly demand of 4.27 with a standard deviation of 1.76, resulting in a calculated order
quantity of 8.38. We rounded this up to 9 units, since fractional magazines are not practical.
Additionally, we are assuming that sell-throughs are minimal, and that suppressed demand
is minimized.

Applying this methodology across all 50 retailers yielded a total required quantity of 419
magazines ðŸš¨correct ~419ðŸš¨ (rounded up from 394.11). A full breakdown is presented in Appendix Q1.
This approach helps Yedioth maintain high service levels while minimizing overproduction
and improving operational efficiency.

(Table 1: Order Quantity by Customer Number)
By applying the newsvendor model, Yedioth can reduce overproduction while maintaining a
high service level, offering a practical solution that enhances both customer satisfaction and
operational efficiency.

Q2. Benefits of Full Inventory Pooling Across All Retailers
We next applied the Newsvendor model to the pooled demand across all 50 retailers,
treating the group as a single aggregated customer.

Using total weekly demand data, we calculated a mean of 189.59 and a standard deviation
of 19.99. Applying a z-score of 2.33 for a 99% service level gave an optimal pooled order
quantity of 236.16 magazines, which we rounded up to 237. ðŸš¨correct poolingðŸš¨ Compared to the sum of
individual retailer quantities from Q1 (419 magazines), full pooling offers a production
reduction of 182 magazines per week.
(See Appendix Q2 for calculation details.)

This reduction highlights the operational benefit of risk pooling, as aggregated demand
reduces variability and lowers the safety stock needed.
Q3. Partial Pooling by Sales Agent
By applying the newsvendor model to each sales agentâ€™s weekly total sales, our team
estimated the production required if Yedioth pooled inventory as agentâ€™s group of retailers.

For each of the 10 agents, we calculated the average and standard deviation of weekly sales
and applied a z-score of 2.33 to ensure a 99% service level.
The resulting agent-level order quantities were rounded up and summed, yielding a total
production requirement of 293 magazines per week ðŸš¨acceptable agent poolingðŸš¨ (see appendix for details). This is 56
magazines more than full pooling (Q2) and 126 fewer than no pooling (Q1), demonstrating
how limited pooling still captures some benefits of aggregation but not as fully as systemwide pooling.

Detailed agent-level results are available in Appendix Q3.

Q4. Leveraging Midweek Sales Agent Visits for Operational Improvements
We propose that each retailer provide sales information midweek through the week to
enable more responsive inventory management. By collecting this midweek data, the sales
agent can adjust inventory levels, either removing excess stock or adding more magazines,
based on actual demand observed in the first half of the week.
These adjustments would be guided by profit maximizing logic from the newsvendor model,
which balances the tradeoff between marginal revenue from additional sales and marginal
salvage costs from unsold inventory. This allows for smarter, data driven decisions that
reduce overproduction and minimize lost sales.
To enable this midweek visibility, we propose implementing RFID for real-time tracking. ðŸš¨specific mechanismðŸš¨
RFID offers reliable and real time tracking of inventory levels at the retailer, which can
significantly improve responsiveness and forecasting accuracy. Although capital-intensive,
RFID can significantly improve demand visibility and reduce inefficiencies. A cost-benefit
analysis is advised to assess the feasibility, particularly for lower-volume retailers.
Q5. Organizational Challenges and Change Management
Implementing these changes may face resistance, particularly from the Research
Department and Sales Agents, due to longstanding cultural norms and incentive structures.
A key challenge will be incentive misalignment. Sales agents are currently rewarded based
on sales volume, which discourages inventory efficiency and encourages overproduction. To
address this, Assaf will need to design a new incentive structure that aligns agent
performance with company goals, such as reducing returns, improving forecast accuracy,
and maintaining service levels, so that sales agents are motivated to support the change
rather than resist it.
In addition, Organizational buy-in ðŸš¨multiple stakeholdersðŸš¨ can be strengthened through pilot programs, clear
communication of financial benefits, and engaging key stakeholders early in the process to
champion change.
