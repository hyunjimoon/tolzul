🚨 WEAKEST LINK: Left side - Can AI actually predict restaurant demand accurately enough?
🧪 BREAK TEST: Test demand forecasting accuracy vs actual restaurant orders
- Cost: 1 month, 5 restaurants, $1K
- Decision rule: If <70% accuracy → improve algorithm, if >85% → expand pilot

EVIDENCE SHOWN:
✗ Weak: Specific numbers (18%, 30%) but no validation source shown

GRADE: 2/6
- Focus (2): Clear customer (urban restaurants) and problem (logistics)
- Evidence (0): Claims without supporting data
- Experiment (0): Core forecasting assumption not tested

ONE LINE: Clear problem-solution fit but unvalidated demand forecasting claims.
