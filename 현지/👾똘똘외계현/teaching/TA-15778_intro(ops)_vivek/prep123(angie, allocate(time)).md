This updated plan is designed for a 30-minute focused session each Thursday. It now includes direct excerpts from the syllabus to streamline your review.

**Week 1 (Today): Process and Capacity Analysis (PATA Case)**

- **Objective:** Understand how to analyze a process, identify a bottleneck, and quantify its impact.
- **Activities (30 min):**
    1. **Review Core Concepts (10 min):** Review the following syllabus excerpts covering process and capacity analysis:
        
        - **Case: McDonald's and Burger KingÂ¹ (July 22):** "Map out the production process, showing the major process steps, inventories and flows for hamburger production in your case." and "analyze the peak hourly capacity and peak hourly demand for burger patties."
        - **Lecture: Capacity Analysis 1: Predictable Variability; JetBlueÂ² (July 23):** Case questions include: "What is the operational impact of de-icing capacity at Logan?" and "Under ideal conditions, theoretically, what is the maximum number of planes per hour that can be processed by four de-icing teams?"
        - **Lecture: Capacity Analysis 2: Unpredictable Variability; Uber (July 25):** Case: "THE EFFECTS OF UBER'S SURGE PRICING: A CASE STUDY [SKIM]".
    2. **Analyze PATA Materials (15 min):** Skim the `PATA Case Grading Scheme.docx` and the `11-127.Teaching Note.PATA.pdf`. Focus on the process flow diagram, the identification of the RN visit as the bottleneck, and the use of a buildup diagram for waiting time analysis.
        
    3. **Formulate Questions (5 min):**
        
        - 1. The teaching note uses a deterministic build-up diagram for the RN queue but a stochastic queuing formula (G/G/mG/G/mG/G/m) for other steps. What is the pedagogical reason for this distinction, and how should I explain to students when to use which model?
        - 2. The grading rubric for PATA mentions "provider variability" as a key concept. Could you recommend a specific framework or a short reading on managing process variability in service operations that I can use to frame this discussion during recitations?
        - 3. The recommended solutions in the teaching note include organizational changes like working in teams and standardizing work. How much emphasis should I place on these qualitative/organizational solutions versus the quantitative analysis during grading and recitation?

**Week 2 (Next Thursday): Inventory Management & Risk Pooling (Yedioth Case)**

- **Objective:** Master the concept of risk pooling and its calculation using different methods.
- **Activities (30 min):**
    1. **Review Core Concepts (10 min):** Review the following syllabus excerpts covering inventory control:
        
        - **Lecture: Inventory Control 1 (July 29)**
        - **Case: Zara (July 30):** Case questions include: "Assuming long lead times, how would a buyer at the Gap make inventory ordering decisions? How do buyers make the same decision for Zara?" and "What are the relative benefits of Inditex/Zara's business models?"
        - **Lecture: Inventory Control 2 (August 1)**
    2. **Analyze Yedioth Materials (15 min):** Review the `YediothSolution.pptx`. Focus on the calculation differences between "No Pooling," "Pooling by Agent," and "Full Pooling." Note how both the empirical histogram and the Normal distribution are used to find the required inventory for a 99% service level.
        
    3. **Formulate Questions (5 min):**
        
        - 4. The solution presents analyses using both the empirical distribution (histogram) and an assumed Normal distribution. In a real-world scenario, what are the primary trade-offs in choosing one approach over the other, and what level of justification should I expect from students on their choice?
        - 5. The concept of risk pooling is central. Beyond the quantitative inventory reduction, what are the key operational complexities or costs (e.g., transportation, information systems) of implementing pooling that students should consider for a complete analysis?
        - 6. The case mentions potential IT solutions like EDI and RFID. How can I guide students to connect these technological enablers to the quantitative benefits of the pooling models they are building?

**Week 3 (Thursday after next): Integrated Dynamic Operations (Littlefield Simulation)**

- **Objective:** Understand the dynamic trade-offs between capacity, inventory, and lead time in the simulation.
- **Activities (30 min):**
    1. **Review Simulation & Exam Scope (10 min):** Review the following syllabus excerpts:
        
        - **Simulation Exercise (Live Aug 7-9):** "With your team, you will get to manage a virtual factory in a web-based simulation exercise." "The goal of this assignment is to let you adapt and apply concepts from the first half of the class in a managerial situation".
        - **Final Exam (Aug 19):** "A final exam will be held in-class, on Monday, August 19, from 8:30 to 11:30." It will "cover the quantitative tools and methodologies taught in class (queuing, inventory policies, etc.)."
    2. **Synthesize Key Trade-offs (15 min):** Review the simulation report questions from the syllabus. Think through the main challenge: maximizing cash by balancing capacity investment against a demand curve that first grows, then stabilizes, and finally collapses.
        
    3. **Formulate Questions (5 min):**
        
        - 7. The simulation involves a non-stationary demand pattern. What fundamental model or framework would you suggest for making capacity decisions (buying machines) when demand is first growing and then declining?
        - 8. The report asks students how they decided on their inventory policy (R,Q). Given the variable demand and lead times, what is the simplest effective model you would recommend students use for setting and updating R and Q throughout the game?
        - 9. The final exam covers quantitative tools. Which specific analyses or calculations from the simulation (e.g., capacity utilization, cycle time estimation, EOQ) are most representative of the skills you want students to demonstrate on the final exam?

# 3. Additional Files to Request

To effectively prepare for your TA duties, I recommend you request the following materials from the professor:

1. **Lecture Notes:** The syllabus mentions that lecture notes will be uploaded to Canvas. These are essential for aligning with the professor's teaching methods, notation, and emphasis.
2. **The Yedioth Case Data File:** The case text explicitly refers to an "accompanying Excel sheet for data". This file is necessary to replicate the analysis in the `YediothSolution.pptx` and to answer any student questions about the data.
3. **Exemplary Past Student Submissions (Anonymized):**
    - **PATA and Yedioth Reports:** Seeing top-scoring examples will help you calibrate your grading, especially on the qualitative aspects of the analysis.
    - **Littlefield Simulation Reports:** A winning report would provide a benchmark for a high-quality strategic analysis.
    - **Venture Pitch Decks:** The syllabus promises to "share successful pitch decks from previous years"; these are critical for grading this unique, creative assignment.
4. **Past Final Exams:** Access to one or two past exams is the best way to prepare for the Final Exam Review recitations, as it will reveal the question format, difficulty, and scope.
5. **Recitation Materials from Previous TAs:** If available, seeing how previous TAs structured the PATA/Yedioth case prep or the Final Exam review sessions would provide a useful template and highlight common student questions or points of confusion.
