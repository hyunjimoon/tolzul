| all  | 10  | 10  | 15  | 10  | 10  | 0     | 55    | Q1: Lost 5pts - assumes sales=demand, missing censoring analysis. Q2: Lost 5pts - weak risk pooling explanation. Q4: Lost 5pts - vague benefit quantification |
| bea  | 10  | 15  | 15  | 15  | 10  | 5     | 70    | Q1: Lost 5pts - treats sales=demand. Excellent Q2-Q4. Bonus +5 for censoring discussion in Q1 |
| bum  | 15  | 15  | 15  | 15  | 10  | 10    | 80    | Perfect technical execution. Bonus +5 censoring (Method B), +5 distribution analysis (Method A vs B comparison) |
| chi  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  | 5   | 0     | 45    | Q1-Q4: Lost 5pts each for missing explanations. Q5: Generic discussion. Needs deeper analysis throughout |
