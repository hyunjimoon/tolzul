🔑 key decision variables are contract 1 and 2 (2, unless LT >>threshold), 

🙋‍♀️formula for numbers of machines and the R and Q for inventory policy 

- **R,Q Formula:** R = (Daily Demand × 7 days=leadtime) + Safety Stock(safety factor, = √(2DS/H) where S=$500k)

- **Machine Formula:** Machines = (Demand Rate × Processing Time) ÷ 0.85 target utilization

- cons: set up cost for machine 3 (fixed)
- maximize utilization of machines

order arrives

interest -> optimal service rate (use to determine machine you need)

GGN formula (expected wait time)

sum of expected wait time (below the lead time)


can't take loan (machine)
faster throughput 
machine, order 
output: delivery (satelite)
longer lead time, shorter lead time (smaller)
