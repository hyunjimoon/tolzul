Speaker 1  0:00  
Canvas, and you just basically put in the COVID. Okay, yeah, so I'll do this at the start of every class. It's like on a rotation, and this way we don't have to worry about it. Okay, back to your sort of scheduled thing, whatever is going on.

Unknown Speaker  0:22  
The and Little Brother.

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
Yeah, So

Unknown Speaker  1:42  
I it's you. Yeah, like, right here We sat every Day,

Unknown Speaker  3:09  
everybody I

Unknown Speaker  4:08  
I was the first half of the semester, it was intense. It was intense. It was kind of like a warm up. It was meant to be a

Speaker 1  4:24  
warm up. It I know. I know that. I know it's pretty intense, right? Like you have your exams just this past week, right? You get two days to take off, two days, something like that. I know it's pretty intense. I'll tell you, like, a little story. So so when I was a kid, my dad decided to do an MBA in his mid 40s, and so, so I got to see the other side of it, like, which is pretty funny, actually. So I think he barely got by each of his, like exams and so forth. I think he failed one class, as I've seen it on the other side, like, you know, in a way that was pretty visceral, actually, but it was actually transformative for his life. You know, after, after doing this, this thing, he decided that he was gonna go start a business of his own, as he did this, and start a business of his own, changed his life, to some extent, to change the lives of his kids, me and my kid brother, so forth. So in a very personal sense, I kind of understand what this what this program means, right? So that's one thing. The other thing, I kind of want to, I'll introduce myself more formally in a second, right? But I did want to say this, this, I've been doing this class for some time, so this is my, it's my 10th year doing this class, right? So I took this glass over from another gentleman who's no longer Sloan and and, you know, I took it over. I thought of it as, like, a little bit of a pain in the ass, because didn't mean, like, you know, guys like, right? Like, it's summer and this and that, like, all this kind of stuff. You know, my kids are typically on vacation, and they go off on vacation and so on and so forth. And then I discovered something really interesting, which was that my kids go off on vacation and I'm alone in the house. That's actually really nice. So I come to really enjoyed this class has one reason, another personal reason, but yet another kind of professional reason I've really come to enjoy this class is kind of all of you, right? And so some particular you know, like I'm saying about my dad, right? All of you, there's a massive kind of opportunity cost of your time, right? Like, as you, as you kind of proceed in your career, the opportunity cost your time gets higher and higher. And so, you know, when folks like you make the decision to spend a year of your life, you're hanging out over here, you have a little bit of a fire, right? Because you're aware of the opportunity cost of your time. So this fire to, kind of like, get shit done right at some level. And so it comes here, typically, full of ideas, right? You're full of ideas, full of energy, super bright. And for me, that's, like, awesome, right? So I enjoy hanging out with people like that. And so, so as a result, you know this, this class has kind of become probably one of my favorite parts of the year, right? And I sort of genuinely, I genuinely read, right? So anyways, you know, I hope this, I hope this ends up being some fun. What we'll do is, here's, here's the plan for today. Okay, so it's our first session, and so my plan for today is pretty, pretty straightforward, um, first, I'd like to kind of talk about what this class first, you know, I'll have Angie's our TA introduce herself. I'll do a little bit of a formal I'll do a little bit of a more formal introduction. And then I kind of want to get into sort of first, what is sort of operations management about, right? What is this, what is this thing, right? And then we'll kind of get into, like, some actual discussions, okay, so that's that. We'll talk about something with fast food, right? But hopefully you'll see more in this classroom. Okay, so that's, that's kind of the plan for today, right? Just to kind of get the ball rolling some, some quick sort of administrative here, right? So we have two TAs, you know, one TAs, Angie, who's going to be in this section. The other is Adam, Joseph. The other section, I'm talking about both of them because through the course of the class, you actually interact with both of them. Okay? So you know, you'll interact with both of them through recitations and office hours and things, things of that you know, things of things of that nature. Angie will introduce herself in a quick second. And then you have an administrative assistant, Kim McGrath. You shouldn't ever need to talk with him, okay, but if you do need to talk with her, you know, here's her, here's her contact information, right? It's right here, and she's generally pretty good to respond. So maybe, actually what we do is Angie. This is Angie's bio, I guess Angie, why don't you introduce yourself? Yeah,

Speaker 2  9:44  
Hi, I'm

Speaker 3  9:49  
Angie moon. I do research on operations for entrepreneurs, and I guess this wasn't the buyer you were expecting

Speaker 1  9:58  
Me neither. I'm so sorry you get angry at me. No, just kidding,

Speaker 3  10:05  
but that's a spirit of entrepreneur. And there are three pillars, or what I call religion, of my life. First is base, and second is innovation, and third is operations. And I'll start from the operations, which is I was really excited about this class, and I was as I was preparing what was teaching, constant theme of matching the capabilities and customers here. So I tried to write down what have, what matching I have done throughout my life as a father. I started by mapping the simple inventory control product with some retailers, but that didn't work out. And then I went into the automated with a similar capability that stems from the prediction of the time series. I developed the automated demand prediction product, which was compelling to the big companies in logistics, and with the same capability of a time series prediction. Now I'm working on the lifecycle weapon system, which is becoming compelling to defense acquisition agencies. So what I'm trying to point out here is there is some shared capabilities which has different gestation period in different industries. That's the operations part. And I use my thesis for bachelor's, master's and PhD in order to develop the underlying capability theory. So time series prediction was my bachelor thesis. And now with Charlie fine, I am working on entrepreneurship. So the idea is, how they propose a value with the promise vendor model, which is a slight extension of the new spender model going on learning this class. So that's me, to prove that's me. I wore the same shirt.

Speaker 1  12:00  
All right. Thank you. Thanks. Angie. Angie is a PhD student at Sloan. Before this, she was a student at Columbia, okay, and this is me. I'll be super quick. I'll try to be super quick. I gotta, like, cut this down. So what ends up happening the bio slide that expands over time. Yeah, you have a question. Can I make it bigger? I have a better idea. Why don't you come sit

Speaker 1  12:43  
for you can come right here. I won't but okay, so by the way, with slides, what I'm going to do is you find that I'll post slides like a pre class version of the slides the previous night, and the pre class version is you can kind of take notes and things like that, right? The version I use in the class is something you won't see before class, and that's for reason, right? And I'll take notes on this, and so on and so forth. I would post a version of this with notes later. Okay, all right, so for my own sort of background. So this is a little crazy, but I'm starting my 19th year at MIT, okay, so I came here in 2000 stop it. And, you know, before, before this, I studied at Stanford University. I'm an engineer, an electrical engineer, okay? And I do research in an area called reinforcement learning. So I've kind of been doing this through my, you know, through my career, actually, starting as an undergrad, and I've continued to do that, you know, applied to a whole bunch of different areas. As it turns out, better to be lucky than to be smart, reinforcement learning has ended up being a central pillar of everything happening inside generative AI today. And so I find myself involved in very, very exciting research, very exciting technology stuff these days. And so as a result of this one, I'm the head of the operations group here at Sloan, but two MIT has something called our generative AI consortium, OK, so it's the center of all sort of generative AI work at MIT, and I'm one of two faculty co directors of MIT generative AI Consortium. That's kind of my MIT thing. Because of my growing age, I have PhD students that are now themselves, professors, people that have graduated from my lab. In fact, two of them are professors here at MIT itself. Now we have professors in other places, Columbia, NYU, even a guy at Harvard, which I put at the very end.

Speaker 1  14:43  
I love teaching, teaching in addition to research, teaching a very big part of my life, okay? And so I developed this class, right that you're that you're taking with me, but I've developed other classes as well over time. So I developed my first product management curriculum. So this is something I created in 2017 something like that, and that grew into, like a product management certificate, this and that, all this kind of stuff. I found that quite interesting too. I also developed a class called hands on deep learning. It's a class I started in 2020 which is kind of funny. The first time we did it, we had like 19 people in the class, or something like that, and that's grown into probably one of our most popular electives here at Sloan, all because of me, of course, nothing to do. Yeah? So this theme of better to be lucky than to be smart, right? Yeah, so I love teaching. And then the final thing is, and I hope this kind of resonates, with all of you, I never really thought I was going to be a professor. Okay? That was never like, like to my mind. I felt like such a so far away from anything I've ever, you know, kind of thought I'd want to do, right? And, in fact, actually, before coming to MIT, I worked at a quantitative hedge fund, so in sort of one of these high frequency funds, was one of the earliest high frequency funds, quite a long time ago. And, you know, I sort of built up the fund and so on and so forth. Within this, it was a prop fund within a much larger money manager. And I sort of enjoyed what I was doing. You know, was going like, well, the work was really exhausting, but I enjoyed it. And then, you know, I met this guy who's a professor from MIT, who was consulted as part of, like, another part of the fixed income forces of fun. And that was a guy, he was like, hey, like, what do you, what do you think with your life? Like you should, you know, you should consider, like, academia. And I thought he was joking, like the funniest thing ever, but he kept talking with me. And I was, I was quite young, and when you're young, you do kind of stupid things. And so I thought to myself, yeah, you know, whatever. Let's see what this is like, right? And so my thought was I'd spend like, two years of a year at MIT, right? That'd be amazing, right? Like, I'd be able to say, oh, you know, as a professor, in two years, something like that. And, you know, now I go back to my life, and, yeah, that two years has clearly grown into kind of a longer time 19 now. So the vacation at MIT continues, in any event. So I found myself at MIT. But one of the amazing things about MIT is it really encourages this sort of Angie had on her slide, this whole Mens et Manus business, right, which is something in Latin. I don't even know what it means mine in hand, whatever, but it translates to, but it translates to something really interesting, right? This is the spirit of like, yeah, you can have all these intellectual ideas. That's great, right? That's very important. But you also need to be able to build stuff. You also need to be able to do this, okay? It's not just about the intellectual Okay, so mind and hand at some level, right? You're thinking about stuff kind of building or whatever it is. And so that's so encouraged at MIT. And so as a result, over my time at MIT, I've been able to kind of translate a number of different intellectual ideas, research ideas, into viable businesses, okay? And so over the course of my time here, you know, sort of companies that have kind of come out of my basically research that's come out of my lab have collectively raised a little over a half billion dollars. And you know, some of them are over here. You know, one was this company select where I was the co founder and CTO. It was one of the first AI supply chain companies. And Nike acquired this company in 2019 it was Nike's second largest acquisition ever. And then I was involved this other company called cera bio, and this is a company that did AI alongside thinking about proteins and things like that, very early in the game, that company, IPO, in late in December 2020, another company simulate which I'm, which I founded a little over a year ago. Actually, the company is really young. It's sort of in its early stages. We raised a little bit of money, and, you know, we're sort of in this sort of generative AI search space, okay, so anyways, I enjoy, kind of the process of building companies, sort of looking at markets, ideally, trying to take a market, right? And so outside of all this, I'm also involved in venture, but in a more passive way, I'm an LP in a number of different fonts, okay, so that's, that's kind of my, that's sort of my background. And hopefully, you know, you kind of see where I'm coming from. Okay, so I do care about, like, deep intellectual ideas. That means a lot to me. But right, man's et Manus, right? The intellectual idea is only one part of it. Right? You actually need to be able to actually do stuff. You actually need to actually be able to do stuff, okay? And so that's, that's very, very much my ethos, and I believe it's very much part of your ethos as well. And so over the year, I'm sure, really excited. Okay, questions, actually, before we get started, not really talked about punch so hopefully we can just get started other than the font size. Okay, all right, so let's get started. Anybody know who this guy is? This is Steve Blank, okay, and he's a pretty successful entrepreneur, not like ridiculously successful, right, but like a pretty successful guy, okay, so he built like six companies, took four companies public, right? The last one was this company called Epiphany, in the night story for you guys, right? 5050. Was one of the first CRM companies, okay, so in the mid 90s, and then after that, like he spent a lot of time at Stanford, really kind of trying to, kind of type, trying to sort of talk through, you know, is entrepreneurship all about just kind of doing stuff, and you just go do it, or, you know, are there some principles right to it, right, that help you, kind of, like, use your limited resources in sort of an effective way, right? He thought, a very and continues to teach, actually, a very, very influential fashion at Stanford. And so generations of entrepreneurs that have kind of gone through Stanford, I'll kind of run into this guy. It's a bit of a legend, okay, right? And so I want to sort of tell you a story that's actually his story, all right, so this is his story that I thought would be very nice to kind of start this class with, because an earlier version of the story actually had a lot of impact on me, and this is kind of an updated version of it. So on the right picture of a drone, okay? And about 11 or 12 years ago, drones were all the rage, okay, by the way, they're kind of back to sort of being the rage, right? Sort of defense tactics sort of really exploded. But drones were all the way, you know, 11 or 12 years ago, and everybody wanted to do something with a drone, right? And so this guy, Steve plant, you know, he did this set of Office art at Stanford, which was, like, really, very, very influential, as I said, right? So you get like teams of, like entrepreneurs that, you know, engineers, whatever that had, like, you know, bright ideas they wanted to build companies to come talk with them, right, to get this his date, and then hopefully, like, introductions, right from him to all these other folks on, you know, Stanford, right, so that they could go, so that they could go. So, anyway, so, right, this, this group of young Stanford engineers came to meet with him, and, you know, talk to him about their drone. And so it turns out that these guys had built some kind of fancy, you know, optical electronics, right? That was really, really good at, essentially, you know, taking, taking imagery, right, ground imagery that was sort of able to detect fine details, you know, what was happening on the ground, okay? And so the idea was, they put this, the electronics, the optic electronics, into kind of appropriate cameras, fly the drones over fields, right? Farmers fields, figure out what was happening in the field, right? Collect huge amounts of data, right? And then, you know, tell the farmer, hey, you know, this part of the field, right? You know, has an infestation, or, you know, whatever it is, right? You need more water. And so that was the idea. We thought that, you know, it was one that could hopefully revolutionize, you know, agricultural productivity.

Speaker 1  24:10  
Okay, so now here's a question for you, right? So I want to, I want you to imagine that your seed plan, right? And besides, to come and talk with you, right? And seed bank has, like, a couple of different options of what, what you can say, right? So one is to say, brilliant idea, you know, here's 50k right? And I'm going to write emails introducing you to a bunch of books. Okay, so that's, that's kind of one option, right? Another option is to say, You know what, not for me, but here's somebody else at, you know, thinks about agriculture and so on and so forth. Maybe, maybe they're interested, right? And the third option is to kind of, sort of say, well, you know, have you thought of x, right? And go, think of x, and then come back, okay. And you gotta remember, also sitting in a Greek like, a lot of these ideas can teach, like, massive ideas. So it's tempting to say x, you know, like, like having 5x but then you might lose it. You might lose the opportunity to work with these things as well. Okay, all right, so your seed plan, these guys come talk with you, right? These guys and gals come talk with you about their agricultural startup. Great idea. What is your response? You

Speaker 4  25:25  
response?

Speaker 1  25:37  
No, didn't say more. The government doesn't farm as far as I know.

Unknown Speaker  25:41  
No, the applications, though, are it

Speaker 1  25:45  
must, yeah, yeah, of course I can see why random. Can you tell us an investment? Oh, really, so I understand that. Like perspective, so, yeah, okay, you can tell them that, but that sounds very positive. So, like, Okay, what applications are you thinking

Unknown Speaker  26:10  
for that technology? I mean,

Speaker 1  26:15  
intelligent surveillance, awesome. Scott, perfect. So it sounds like it's the third option of the first option. Are you going to get that money? Yes, you are okay. So the first option, here's a check. Awesome. I like it great. Got some instinct. I mean, here you'd like us to see make sense. Other other responses, yeah, season, yeah. Talk to the people I asked

Unknown Speaker  26:47  
to. Had a knowledge,

Speaker 1  26:52  
yes, yeah, monitor what's going on. I see you want to bet the idea with someone Yes, oh yeah, but don't I have to watch very closely. Let me prove a little bit further. And I know I gave the second option as an option, but let's imagine you don't know any friends that are giving anything in agriculture. Okay, great to give them the chat. If you had advice for them with the chat, which was, you're looking in the wrong area, go talk to people. Do you have any advice for them? Well, probably they need to figure

Unknown Speaker  27:37  
out the latest but I'm not

Unknown Speaker  27:46  
quite sure.

Unknown Speaker  27:50  
Is okay, good,

Unknown Speaker  28:00  
okay.

Speaker 5  28:09  
All right, what's the current way farmers are monitoring their fields, like, what is the existing process We're disrupting, and then also understanding the cost of this machine to farmers?

Speaker 1  28:24  
Yeah, yeah. So you're kind of curious about the economic equation,

Speaker 5  28:28  
yeah. And then, if that works out, one yes,

Speaker 1  28:31  
what should they do? What do you think they should do? So these two guys have a check.

Speaker 5  28:36  
I think I'm surveying farmers. I'm going to farmers and saying, kind of see things point on understanding pay to say, how are you existing monitoring this, and what's the value

Speaker 1  28:48  
problem with this, by the way. So one of the things I've kind of realized, I call this the Mom Test, okay? One of the things I've realized with surveys is the following, right? Now, it's best told with, like, a story, right? So let's say, you know, you can grow your mother, right? And you say, Look, Mom, this amazing recipe app, okay? Like, it stores all your recipes. And, like, I've really gotten into cooking. It stores all my recipes, right? And like, here's all what the app does, blah, blah, blah. It's amazing. I'm thinking of, like, like, just quitting my job, just focusing on this recipe, right? What's your mom going to say to you, oh, the mom is loves you, hopefully, right? And she's, she's going to say something to the effect of, oh, wow, that's amazing, right? That's an incredible app. Watch out about quitting your job and stuff. But lovely app, of course, I would pay $50 to download the app, right? The problem is, human beings tend to be like your mom, right? So when you're asked about something, you're the farmer. Farmers never seen anything like this. Farmers, they say, Holy cow, this is incredible. Of course, I want this right, and so surveys tend to give you a pretty bullshit response most of the time, right? Or at the very least, they're they tend to be overly rosy. There are careful ways of doing this at scale and so forth, but to run into this issue, so I don't know, I'd be dubious, especially about something like this, right? Because this has never existed, and so, you know, the farmer doesn't even have, like, a frame of reference. You see my challenge? Yeah? Okay, what else? Gary, yeah, I'll come to you later. Industry, you

Speaker 1  30:35  
want to do an experiment. Okay, so can we put yourself on the other side? Right? The advice might be, you know what? Here's the check. It's 50 grand, right, go build a couple of drones, right? Get a farmer and fly the drones around. And, you know, see how much money you can that's roughly the plan. And that sort of gets to me, right, like what you guys are kind of talking right? So take the jack, build a couple of drones, fly the drones around. So that's kind of sounds like, why we're converting

Unknown Speaker  31:19  
later, they just have an

Speaker 1  31:26  
idea. Right? Yeah, so let's, let's imagine the farmer has said, I love the idea, right? So maybe they have talked with farmers, and maybe the response to the farmers has been totally cut open. But then you gotta kind of

Speaker 1  31:55  
worry about the contestants you're

Unknown Speaker  32:02  
saying this is just a claim man to

Speaker 1  32:07  
man, okay, they are brilliant. And if you have a technology that's potentially Angie, Ah, okay, so let's say the science of the technology rocks off. Okay, what's the detectives like? Rock solid. They're not DS, right. What they are potentially just pull up is like the agriculture. They know nothing about agriculture. So to be clear, you know zero about agriculture. But yes, I do see your reaction.

Speaker 4  32:41  
Yes, it's a scalable business search. They have the idea.

Speaker 1  32:54  
Okay, so it sounds like, in general, I'm hearing a desire to invest there is some, you know, like, which reflects the natural kind of risk aversion in the group, right? They're like, different people have different postures. So let's say for a quick second, giving them cash. Let's say you've given them cash just for arguments right now, it's like your cash. It's like it's on you to try and make sure that they do something right. And there's some basic things you can do. You can do. You can make interruptions it doesn't have. You can give them advice. Is another place to look you know? You think that's that's greener pastures, or whatever it is. But let's say they're also stuck on the agriculture thing, right? Like, you like, what do you know, right? Like, about, like, agriculture orders for that, right? So let's say you've given them the cash. They're stuck on this agriculture idea, right? What do you want them to do with the cash the person makes sense, right? Simple question, standard.

Speaker 1  34:05  
Right, like it's very good and three times. right so doing multiple interests I mean did one. We go multiple industries, non starters, right? Good dangers. Even if they wanted to do it right, they kind of

Speaker 4  34:21  
actually see something similar before. And actually, when they do that, they, I guess it's maybe we see some things. So it was actually, they can actually test it out, like, kind of like construction with environment and people. And things that they actually had some contract that works

Speaker 1  34:42  
out? Sure, yeah. I like the notion of getting somebody to pay for something. That's the ultimate thing, right? Because you're no longer in Mom Test territory. Somebody's written a child. I like that. Going back to the first question, we're past that.

Unknown Speaker  34:59  
Too late with regards to the chip. DK, I think

Unknown Speaker  35:04  
you probably create a couple of drones. How much the

Speaker 1  35:12  
customers? So the straightforward thing is, go build a bunch of drones and find your customers, fly around the drones, right? Okay, I guess so. Let's say it's gonna take some time, right? So I gotta build a drone. The drone has to work, blah, blah, blah, all that sort of stuff. And having done that, right? Um, I could fly the drone. And maybe, maybe something's not working right, like maybe the camera, this is going to take a long time, right? And to Sandra's point and Cameron's point, maybe there's greener pastures, right? So at some level, I want to figure out whether this works like that. I think we all agree, right? We want to figure out if there's like, a there, there, right? Like, is there? Is there something in this business, plus this just complete bullshit, right? That's the first thing you want to figure out. The most straightforward thing is build the drones, fly them around and so on, right? Let's figure out if this business works, build drones. Okay, can you guys figure out a quicker way of doing that, right? Like, because you see what I said, right? Like, it's a hardware business. Hardware business is really hard, right? There's been a drone. I gotta tweak the camera, like this, that all this stuff by the time of a drone flying, and then somebody will say, Oh no, I'm gonna need software and this and that, whatever it's doing one year before, like the drone takes flood, right? And then after that, you'd be like, Oh my God. Now we've got to wait for the right season with the farm, and then something else, and then something else. So before you know it, yeah, you're like, oh yeah. Modular camera, okay, so that uses the

Speaker 1  36:53  
ability to do the ability they want to be clear, they want building the drone, right? They buy a drone off the shelf. The whole thing is like integrating, like this, flight planning software with the drone and the camera and so on, which is like, how do we minimize the amount of work at the same time, get a valuable test, right? That does that question make sense? Right? We want to minimize the amount of work we put in, but maximize our learning, right? That's what we want to do, search for something, satellite,

Unknown Speaker  37:32  
example, use

Unknown Speaker  37:34  
satellite technologies with

Speaker 4  37:39  
similar technology. Maybe it's not that accurate, but they can use it

Speaker 1  37:45  
prove what I like, where you're going, prove that the technology is solving the problem. Look for the problem. What's the problem? You need to figure out which program. Well, what's the problem they're working on here? Maybe irrigation. Okay, I like, I like, where the discussion is going up. What is the problem? Yeah, what's the problem we're attacking? Let's, let's go here. So, yeah, low yield, that is the problem, right? I love it, right? So that's the problem, and we're trying to solve that problem. How?

Speaker 1  38:24  
Good? But yes, but Right, like, like, like, we want to figure out where the plants need more water. Yeah, look, I've never successfully grown a plant in my life, but Right? But let's say, right. Figure out where to put more water, all that sort of sort of stuff, right? Okay, good, if that's how we're solving the problem of low u what do we need to guide the farm? Sure,

Speaker 1  38:55  
that's what they need, sure. So you want, you want this data as quickly as possible. Yes, I'm

Speaker 4  38:59  
thinking maybe to build a model of humanate Somehow, and like financial model, understanding how much

Speaker 1  39:08  
it costs, how much time, good. So I think that's the cost side of the equation. I think let's worry about that, because in scale technologies and this and that, those things tend to change rapidly, right? The value side is going to take seriously. And so I think what we're talking about over here is the value side of the equation, right? Saying, hey, you know you're going to increase yield, and if you can increase yield, I mean, who knows? That could be worth a lot of money, right? Now, our vector, the increase yield over here is more data, right? That's, that's basically the point, right? So, so what? What should be times? There

Unknown Speaker  39:50  
could be multiple, basically, reasons for why. So are we actually actual problem? For example, a climate change issue,

Speaker 1  40:00  
for example, this discussion has ended up right? So we said, basically, this is about giving the farmer data that improves the yield. That's basically what works, right? Whether the data came from a drone or from God, or from whatever like irrelevant, right? It's actually because a farmer doesn't care about the drone, the farmer cares about the data, right? And so in this time, it goes all the way back to blank, Right? Steve Lex, sort of thought over here was actually rototype, right? And next thing was like, hey, like, you don't need to build any drones, right? Here's what it's going to do. You're going to, like, go out there on a freaking tractor, and you're basically going to collect all this information manually, right? If you can't calculate it from the ground, now, you're going to collect it from the sky, right? So you're going to, you're going to collect all of the data manually. You're going to give the data to farmer, right? All you're going to see is this thing actually has any doubt, right? So if you sort of think about that process completely took out all of the development here, right? Manually collect all of the data during the farmer, see what, all. Right. Why did I go through this story? I went through the story, because this, in a sense, sets up. I think what this class is about. Okay, so this class is about two things, broadly speaking, right? Yes, it's called operations management. But really, this class about managing products. Okay, that's really what this class is about, and we're going to manage products. The first thing we've asked ourselves, what is a product like? What is a product at the end of the day, right? Like? In this case, what was the product? Yes, the data not the drone, right? But very easy to think of the drone as being the product, right? Very easy to mistake the product for the drone, right? Because these guys are so excited with the drone, and it's off to electronics and this and that all this other nonsense, right? You might think the drone is the data that comes out of this, right? So the two just this slide in the next one. Back to my mind, the two most important slides in this class. Okay, so first thing right that we want to ask ourselves, right is basically right, like in defining a product, right? When we define a product, we're basically going to ask two questions in defining a product, and we'll do this live in a second. Okay? So first question is, how are you adding value? Right? So the drone guys, how would they add in value? Not the drone, right? So the first question, and really it wasn't even the data, right? If you really dig into it, they're selling a signal, right? They're selling a signal that hopefully helps you improve yield, right? They're selling advice that says, put more water here, more pesticide there, whatever it is, right? So question one is, what's the problem we're solving? You know, yield, like you said. So crisp, right? And how are we adding value towards solving that problem? Because that's question one, you're like, what is the problem you solve and how you add value? Question two, of defining the product is to answer this next question. Okay, great, you're doing this. But why should the farmer come to you, right? Like, what's the farmer's other alternative? What would the farmer do instead of coming right? And so in defining the product, you need to be asking these two questions continuously, and you presumably you'd be happy with the answer. Okay, so question number one, what's the problem we solved? Question number two, why should anybody come to you, right? Why not go to your competitor? And so if you sort of think about that as the definition of product, okay, Operations Management is about managing two bubbles, so to speak. Okay? So one bubble is sort of the product centric view of things, right? So the problem we solve that might change over time, right? Just like Cameron's pointing out, like earlier, right? Like Cameron's initial instinct was built in that problem, right? So I want to think of this from the perspective of a CEO, someone steering the ship, right? So on the one hand, of this bubble where you're thinking about the problem you're solving, right, you hopefully start with a cogent definition of that problem, right? And what does that cogent definition mean? You have to basically speak to what the problem you're solving and solving is and why something should come to you. That's one bubble. The other bubble, right? Is, what are your capabilities? Okay, so great. That's the problem. I want to solve data for agriculture, whatever it is, right? On the other side, I'm asking myself, What makes me special? What are my resources? Okay, what do I have access? Right? We have access to lots of different things. In that case, maybe you have access to some differentiating technology, but maybe you may have access to, you know, human resources that are particularly special. Think about generative reality, right? It's a race roughly, for human resources, right? Maybe, you know, you have a supply chain you have access to that nobody has access to, and so on and so forth. Okay, so you got the product on the one side, got the capabilities on the other side. And roughly speaking, okay, Operations Management, this entire class is about going back and forth between these two bubbles. So what do I mean by going back and forth between these two models, right? I mean it's the following, right? You may say to yourself, look, here's my current product, right? But given the capabilities I have, right, I've actually better served tweaking my product right in the following way, because if I tweak my product in this way, right, I will have no competitors, at least for the short term, or something like that, right? So I have these special capabilities, these special resources, if I use them in the right way, right? Here's a unique product that I can put together that's really novel for the marketplace, right? And so that's going from capabilities in the product direction, right? The other direction is going from, your product to capabilities, which is saying, Listen, I really think the puck is going here. I think this is the product we need to have. And I have all these capabilities, but this other capability is going to take some time to build up, and I need to go and make an investment in that capability. Okay, now, as a CEO, okay, I should be able to wake you up at like three in the morning, right? And you should have a very, very clear sense of what your product is today, what it's going to be a year from now, what it's going to be four years from now, right? What your capabilities look like today, right? What are they going to be a year from now? What they're going to be 42 right? And most importantly, right? A CEO, okay, you really know how to go back and forth between these two bubbles, okay, what are the capabilities you need to kind of affect change, right? And affect change in as sort of resource effective, resource efficient a way as possible. Okay, this class is all about that. Okay, so this class is about levers that let us go back and forth between these two bubbles. Okay, and this sounds very abstract, because it is, right? And I hate this sort of abstraction. And so what we're going to do next is we're really going to get to a real problem. Okay, enough of the abstraction, right? I want to get to a real problem. And you know, for that real problem, I thought it'd be fun to kind of start with something we can all sort of identify with, right? Like eating fast food. Hopefully everybody likes fast food. Yes, all right, but when was the last time somebody had McDonald's or Burger King 10 years? Yeah, what's wrong with you guys? I live on this stuff. Okay, here's, here's what I'd like to do. Okay, here's what I'd like to do. Okay, I want to, I want to bring that picture to life, right? That picture is very abstract, and so I want to bring that picture to life, okay, and so the first thing I'd like to do, okay, hopefully you've all read the case, right? Some of you read the burger king here, and some of you guys that McDonald's, right? So what I'd like for you guys to spend two minutes, okay, amongst friends, right, like with each other, and think through the following. Okay? So first off, as Burger King and McDonald's, think about their product, right? They're selling the product, you know, whatever that is, right? What? How are they adding value? What are the key dimensions along which you would measure the value? Right? Like in the drone case was clear, right? It's like, Hey, if you give me, you know you're selling the data, and I can use this data to drive the following changes, right? And I can measure those changes, okay? So these guys are selling something a little bit more simple than data, right? But nonetheless, it's a product. And the question is, if you look at this as added value, what are the dimensions on which you want to measure that added value? Okay, so I want you to think about that, right? And then, like, part of this is, I, you know, remember I said, with thinking about a product, you ask yourself, well, how are you adding value? And then the second question is, why should somebody come to you? Right? So the second question I have over here is, how are Burger King and McDonald's positioned relative to each other on these dimensions that you've identified? Okay, so talk to talk about your spouse. Spend two minutes thinking about this, and Then we'll come back up and discuss you.

Unknown Speaker  50:33  
My God,

Speaker 1  51:26  
so as I said, we'll talk about McDonald's and Burger King. What are the dimensions on which they added value? Yes, hey, my namesake, awesome.

Speaker 6  51:38  
So I think what we discussed, one of the key parameters would be the customer waiting time.

Speaker 1  51:44  
So time faster than it right? So time, somebody remind me what the times are. I think I have them in my notes.

Unknown Speaker  51:57  
Four minute average, three bowl, four

Speaker 1  51:59  
minutes average, but twisted goal and what was this number for McDonald's? 130 Okay, good, okay, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry, yeah, of course. Uh, ah, thank you. Okay, so time that that kind of makes sense, right, I want my food fast. Yeah, uh, Daniel, so another thing is

Speaker 7  52:23  
the quality of the food, because it's, for example, they discard the french fries at seven minutes. They discard the pies after an hour and a half.

Speaker 1  52:34  
Good. So I guess, in fact, I should have asked this a time as well, right? So who's I mean, this sounds really dumb, but, but barely right, like, Who's faster, I guess. Does that matter to you? What does it depend? I It depend? So my kids are allowed to get Happy Meals now and then. And it's like, all right, like, because so, so now I've learned you don't go into the store clown show. So instead you go go to the drive through. But now in the drive through, my kids are seven, nine and 11, right? So they're pretty young, but they'll be like, screaming, no, add the slushie. I'll do this. That means, oh, it's horrible, right? I couldn't I just want to get out. So, yeah, I agree as much that fast, but it depends. So quality raises sort of even more. You know, how are you thinking about quality here? Daniela, you have a certain way of thinking about it, clearly, standardization. Standardization. What does that mean? Oh, okay. So, like, if I am, I go to the McDonald's in Boston versus the McDonald's in New York versus whatever San Francisco. Okay, so you're thinking freshness as well. Okay, standardization, freshness. There's a whole bunch of ways we could, we could define things, but it's pretty clear that this is not a like, right? Like, you know, getting a burger at McDonald's is understood to not be the same thing as getting a burger at the Four Seasons, right? You're not, you're not like the four seasons. You say quality. So, you know, we're using the finest meat. And you know, was this cooked medium rare, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, I mean, if you go to McDonald's and say, cook my burger, medium rare, and so, yeah, so, okay, so quality, that could be A pretty complicated, complicated discussion.

Unknown Speaker  54:47  
Consistency,

Speaker 1  54:54  
that's my other reason. Sure. Sure. So if we want to give these guys stars, right? One star for being God, awful in whatever dimension of quality you want, yeah, three stars for being amazing. How many stars do you want to give these guys? Two stars like pretty tricky, right? But, but I think they're kind of like Mac and neck. Okay, so I let's make them mechanic. I'll give them two steps. I'm feeling generous, all right. Other, other, other dimensions, yeah,

Speaker 8  55:28  
so advertise their capability to customize the sandwiches. Okay, absolutely, they didn't give that promise for long, but at least they started with this. Okay,

Speaker 1  55:38  
yeah, so you can sort of talk about, like, flexibility, and that was a big deal with right, like, they said, like, right, like, and in fact, in what sense was it a big deal, right? So at Burger King, you could say, you know, I want my burger without pickles, right? And McDonald's, if you said I want my burger without pickles and without whatever, what would happen to you? And in what precise way, like, like, whoever, right, step aside. Yeah, exactly. You're literally asked to kind of step aside, right? And later on, when we look at that process, we'll sort of see that like they don't have an option. That's literally, you're stepping aside because your burger isn't there. I can't give it to you. I've got to start the whole process from scratch, right? Like it's a completely standardized product. That's actually, like, to the point about standardization. It's standardized down to the condiments to everything, right? So you ask for a little tweak, you immediately have to stand aside, right? It's not like they're choosing to do that. They have to, right? And so, yeah, you can't ask for medium rare at either of these places. But within the realm of like, fast food, let's say we give these guys, how many stars, one, right? Like, there's no flexibility, then we get these guys, what, maybe one and a half, something like that. Okay, other things, other dimensions, I see a whole bunch of hints. What's your name? Alexander, Alexander. I found something very heated,

Speaker 4  57:14  
mostly, where were offering flexible payment options to drive through. So

Unknown Speaker  57:19  
for example, this

Unknown Speaker  57:34  
one, okay, wow. Okay, that's actually pretty interesting. Yeah, should I give them one more Star half? Course, I will give it

Speaker 1  57:50  
in like two more. I don't know about the two, but I'll listen to you other other things.

Speaker 1  58:14  
Okay, scalable, I have the question, what does that have to do with the product? Right? Because when we talk about the product, notice that we're talking about everything from the customer

Speaker 1  58:33  
perspective. But I appreciate the point. I but I appreciate the point, and keep that in the back

Unknown Speaker  58:39  
of your mind. I

Speaker 1  58:52  
want to come back, but from the product perspective, okay, price, price is, like, super important, right? Price is very, very important. Nice, right? And I'll give both of them, like a lot of stars, because they are affordable and they're more or less, they're sort of more or less the same. Okay, we can keep going, but let's stop here for a quick second. Okay, because we've, we've actually kind of, we're bringing to life, right, the dimensions on which these guys are, you know, expressing added value, right? And we're sort of saying, look, they get to either flexible or not so flexible, but consistent, offering really fast, right? Really fast kind of, kind of, kind of varies. Okay, I want to focus on the fastest for a second, right? We could focus on any of these, really, but let's drill into the fastest, right, because there's so much talk about the past, whatever, right? So earlier, I asked you whether, whether Burger King was slower than McDonald's, and you said, Yes. I mean, of course, when you measure it, four minutes is slower than the two minutes, right? But I guess, like, how would you be aware of this as a customer

Speaker 5  1:00:10  
the weekend time? I don't care about their internal process, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:00:16  
yeah, but here's, here's my, here's my, I agree with what you're saying, but let me, let me just probe a little bit, right? So when you place your order, the first thing you do is start a stopwatch.

Speaker 5  1:00:26  
No other feeling. I mean, like feeling, yeah, if I see life, all the stuff that is gathering up, if I see that, like there was a large view, I've got the feeling that it's not so efficient. It's not so

Speaker 1  1:00:37  
yeah, um, I think so, right, like, this is why I start getting a little bit blurred. So if it's just a feeling, it's just a feeling. Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:00:53  
okay, good military example. This is not McDonald's. This is yesterday example. We're in Chicago, and there is a very famous chain of hot dogs, and it's not efficient. And it was so in line with the business case, yeah. So what? What I saw that the last mile, it was piled up with all that hot dogs that were actually ready to be given, but they were not so efficient in terms of, you know, these numbers that you need to so,

Speaker 1  1:01:21  
by the way, my favorite spot, whenever they go to Chicago, they're gonna, I hate being in the airport, but, but when I'm in the airport there, there's, like this place called the Frontera grill. I've been kind of going there for the last, like, 15 Yeah, it's like a Mexican house, awful, horribly So, but the tortilla soup is like, so, you know, there's this trade off. But here's what I'm worried about. What I'm worried about is there, right? The experience is more like 30 minutes. Sorry, about 30, but like 15 minutes or something, I might catch my flame. 15 minutes matters, you know, whatever, great. I'm worried that, like four minutes versus two minutes, and nobody said, notice that's, that's kind of where my head is. So, right, guys, we're going to make a big noise about time, right? What? I'm kind of where everybody, if this was something where somebody was was measuring this and, like, you know, it was directed, like, oh my god, it took me four minutes. This time, it took me three minutes 45 seconds. That'd be one thing, but it's just this kind of, like, wishy washy sort of sense of time, and two minutes versus four minutes, that maybe there's, you know, in the off case, there are people that need to catch a flight or something like that, that matters. I'm sort of worried that, like, two minutes means nothing, and if two minutes means nothing, then immediately, I look at the Burger King story and I say, that's a win, right? Everybody with me, right? Yes. On the other hand, you know you need to convince me that two minutes is something, and I'm not really sure how we go about convincing ourselves that two minutes is something, right?

Speaker 1  1:03:14  
This is, this is net of all that, right? This is net of all of that. This is the average time people face. It's not this is net of your this is what people experience the real time.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:34  
Okay, when you go into to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37  
matter

Speaker 1  1:03:40  
in both places, right? This is like an average,

Speaker 9  1:03:47  
yeah, so So on the customer's perspective, what I think is that perception is reality, and perhaps two minutes is not that much. But when you compare, when you go to Burger King and then you go to McDonald's, because you are a customer of both you you know it's that different.

Speaker 1  1:04:10  
Okay, here, I should you say it is because it is pushed back, right? I could say it's unlikely to be the case that you experience Burger King and McDonald simultaneously, right? Do you do Burger King today, tomorrow night to McDonald's? And

Speaker 9  1:04:30  
your perception, perhaps will be okay today. It was two minutes of my thoughts, and I don't know if

Speaker 1  1:04:37  
tomorrow. No, that's what I'm trying to say. If you're looking for it, then yes, maybe you would spot it. People are not really looking for it, right? And as long as it kind of flies under the radar, it doesn't matter. So I guess the point I'm trying to make is the following, right? There's probably a number where, if you exceed that number, this is really bad, right? Like, it's like, Oh, come on, you know, 15 minutes, that's too much. 12 minutes, that's right. I'm wondering when the four minutes is okay. It's under the number, right? So, like, if you're two minutes or four minutes or three minutes, I don't care, as long as you're under yourself, that's kind of where my where my height is, right,

Speaker 10  1:05:13  
where I'm sort of waiting. For example, if you have your drinks first and you can drink while you wait your hamburger, that's

Speaker 1  1:05:22  
another great point, right? Basically, you're saying experience time also matters, right? To be like go classic cricket like you look at like coffee shops or bars and things like that, right? They have big mirrors behind the bartender, mirrors behind the bartender or the barista, whatever. Right? We love looking at ourselves. Oh, my God, it's great. That's it so, right? So that's experiencing time, right? Okay, I guess this is leading us in the following direction, right? So we're saying time matters. And we're sort of thinking about this now from a corporate perspective, okay, so I don't know, McDonald's Burger King, like, they're thinking of they're looking at this, right? The CEO, like, let's say Burger King looks at this, right? One view is the CEO says, I'm, you know, speeding things up is not part of our corporate strategy. We're not investing money. Why? Because I look at things this way, and we're winning on flexibility, we're consistent on quality and price, and nobody notices the difference in time. To me, I say, like, I don't see the difference. I don't make an argument. Like, I just right, this is a really crappy argument, right? There's there's, it just relies on, like, I don't know, saying stuff right? And it makes me very uncomfortable. It should make you feel uncomfortable too. Okay, so my question is, how should we measure right, the difference between four minutes and two minutes a year? So what? It clearly can't be units of time, right? The units of time, the difference is two minutes, and that's meetings. So what are the right units in which to compare? You know, time limits, and it sounds weird, right? I'm saying don't measure time in units of times.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14  
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:07:21  
But what we said is like, like, right, like freshness was like on scale of like 30 something, like

Speaker 6  1:07:33  
that. People customers getting warmer, getting warmer, yeah, so the amount of time you missed optimal was four minutes at the

Unknown Speaker  1:07:45  
next time. But

Speaker 1  1:07:47  
who cares? What does optimal even mean? Right? That's my point. Like maybe optimal is for me, delinquencies, delinquencies. Oh, people that decide to leave no no, but that I would push back on some arbitrary number, like, who said it should be tomorrow? You come around and say it should be 20 seconds. So I guess I'm asking, like, how should we even set the standards? So how should we set maybe here's a better way of asking my question, right? Should the standard be four minutes? Should be two minutes should be five seconds. Like five seconds is better than two minutes, right? Okay, so how should I set the standard? Stephanie, have you spoken? I have not go for it. Can you be relative to your competitor? Yeah, but see if I'm relative to my competitor, what do you say? Just be to be faster, but see that's difficult, right? Like, because if I'm there are multiple dimensions, because I am better at flexibility, slightly worse on time, you're twice as worse? No, but that's my question. It's not clear that twice as worse matters, right? Like if the standard was five seconds, 35 seconds doesn't matter. From 10 seconds, five seconds doesn't matter, right? So same story. Maybe two minutes, four minutes doesn't matter, right? So my question is, how should I set that gold standard? How should I think about the length of cube,

Speaker 10  1:09:12  
the longer the impression that all right,

Speaker 1  1:09:19  
we're getting to an answer that like, once we get to this answer, you'll realize I love this answer, and then you'll just see this every session. Why are the units? No, I don't like customer satisfaction. The dollars, dollars. All this should like, like, match the dollar, some, okay, all this is someone after dollar. That's all you care about. Of course, we care about others. Great. We really care about dollars. So really, the question is that, like, what does this mean with like respect to like, things like EBIT or market share or things like that, right? You guys see what I'm saying, right? That that might really matter. Okay? So the first thing you'd want to do is you'd want to understand, right, if I and this is going to be localized, right, like, if you have no fast food options, I'm allowed to be a little bit later. There's like nine fast food places all around each other. Chances are it's going to be a more competitive marketplace, right? And so you need to be asking the question, listen, I'm at four minutes, if I shaved off, I don't know, 15 seconds. Okay, what does that mean to me, in terms of my market share. What does that mean to me as a result, in terms of event, in terms of whatever right those, those are the sorts of questions you want to ask. Is this any time, right? Because once you have that question right, okay, am I four minutes? If I shave off 15 seconds, increase market share by so much. If it cost me this much to say, shave off the 15 seconds immediately. I know whether it makes sense or not, right? So that's the question we need to ask. And the crazy thing is, in the fast food industry, okay, people have done this, right, as you might imagine. Okay, so here's a study. It's a little bit old, but there's studies like this that happen all the time. Okay, so this is one of the better ones. Okay, it's 13 or 14 years old, but it gives you a sense, right? The rough idea is the problem, okay? Basically, if you shave off seven seconds and your McDonald's, a name brand, McDonald's or Burger King, that translates to a 3% increase in market share, okay? And if you're a nobody, it translates to a smaller degree by one person. So the impact of seven seconds is huge, like, the impact of, like, two minutes. That's like, it's gigantic, all right? So two minutes, it turns out, is a right, that is a big that is a big gulf, okay, right? Why? Because it turns out people vote with their feet and with their wallets, right? We could just keep discussing about like, things at the end of the day. We want to understand what this means in the market, right? And it turns out that, yeah, people work with their wallets, and, you know, every seven seconds, 3% increase in market in a competitive environment. Okay, all right, so I want to argue about the study, by the way, right? That you can read the study later. If you have points on it, you can tell me, but time matters. Two Minutes is like an ungodly amount of time. Okay? That's, that's, that's really, really low. So we look at this picture, you'll see a Burger King. You ought to be looking at this. You ought to be saying to yourself, Man, that's bad. We're paying a heavy price for that flexibility. Right at the same time, if you're McDonald's, you ought to be looking at this and saying, listen, being 30 seconds off, like, if I improved by 30 seconds, I'm McDonald's, the most recognized brand in this space, right? I'm just leaving money on the table. What am I doing? I actually do so as a result of either of these guys. The difference is, like, huge. Okay, this is a very, very, very large number, right? This is a very, very large miss in the product that they're putting together. Okay? And so now what I want to do is, I want to say, okay, given that this is the case, let's dig into this, right? Let's, let's, let's understand what the hell is actually going on, right? Maybe we can actually figure out, like for Burger King and for McDonald's, right, what they need to do to solve this problem. Everybody with me? Yeah. So the first thing we'll do, okay, but you're going to see that this is like a common practice, okay? We're going to try and understand what the underlying process, okay? And today it's like making burgers on Friday. It's going to be a more of a service thing, right? But this is the prime. This I did some silly, the kind of process for making a sandwich. Because, what do you learn, I learned how to make a sandwich, can tell. You

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04  
it really makes a difference to

Speaker 1  1:14:22  
represent things where there's an inventory of something, okay, we have a store of something, okay. So I have this store of patties, right? And I have this inventory of buns, so an inventory of patties and inventory of buns, right? And if I need to make a sandwich, you know, the patty and the bun they get, you know, whatever they get grilled on, like some grill kind of thing, some moving grill called a chain, right? So you grill it, then you put the patty and the bum together, you put it in this thing called a steam table, by the way, this is a real thing if you've worked at a restaurant, right? It's basically a thing where you keep the stuff warm, okay? You keep the food warm without drying it out. Okay, so basically, you keep the burgers more warm on the steam table. If the burgers have been sitting on the steam table for too long, you trash the burgers, right? Otherwise, you assemble. You put the final thing together, right? So what's sitting on the steam table over here is simply like the patty and the bun, nothing else, right? When an actual order comes in, you actually put it together. Over here, this assembly table, I guess you use condiments, whatever ketchup, mustard, whatever it is, you know, put your burger together. You might even put it in the microwave for a short amount of time, and then you just sell it directly to the customer. Or, if it's like, something that's a fast moving item, you might actually keep it like, you know, the stack of finished goods, because this is so fast moving, it's going to sell really quick. Okay, so just in terms of, because we'll draw many processes over time, right? The triangles, as I said, these are inventories. The rectangles, these are sort of process steps, right. The dashed line, I mean the arrow lines, right. These are this. This represents kind of the flow of something physical, right? So there's something flowing physically, and then I actually have these gas lines right, like a microphone and shoots. I'm using the gas lines to show a flow of information. Okay? So there's a flow of information, obviously, from the counter back to Assembly, where somebody's yelling, right? Like, oh yeah, give me a Whopper with no pickles or whatever it is, right? At the same time, the chutes over there. They have lights, right? Saying, Okay, this is how much you want a whopper. This is how much you want lot of, you know, I don't know, whatever else they sell, okay, so that's that process. Okay, who's that process? Before actually getting into this process, let me show you a different process, right? This is the Burger King process. This is the McDonald's process, right? So, it starts with the patty and the bun as before. These get grilled on, you know, the patties get grilled on a grill. The buns get caramelized, whatever it is, on something separate. There's an assembly station where it gets put together. The product gets mapped. It gets put in a bin, and the bin sells on the counter, right? The counter, just the counter. Person grabs something from the bin and simply, you know, sells it. The slips over there. That's an information flow. This is if you ask for something weird, right? You say, I don't want pickles. You create a slip, right? A piece of paper that says, A 40 pounder without pickles. You sell it all the way back to the group, right? And then, you know, you got this thing, this other dashed line, which is Lindy. Lindy is like our human inventory manager, right? She really understands kind of the ebb and flow of things. Say, oh, I need more of this. I need less of that. And you have the lights and all that sort of stuff. Different looking process, right? This process looks really different from this

Unknown Speaker  1:17:42  
process. What's the key difference? Alexi,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:49  
microwave process takes a lot of time. The what microwave

Speaker 1  1:17:56  
process? The microwave process so they had one process steps, you're saying, right? You say, yeah, they might need to microwave something, yeah, okay. What are the other differences,

Speaker 6  1:18:13  
Brendan feedback in the working process, or feedback from

Speaker 1  1:18:21  
the process? Yeah? So first of all, what is the oops? What is this feedback? Right? It's not really feedback. It's more like a signal of this is how much you need to make. Like, that's kind of the main thing. And then, yes, there's this exception of the slips over here, right? But I like your point, right? Like, so here's something interesting, right? McDonald's doesn't have a steam table. Like, look at that, right? They just put the burger together. There's no steam table,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:50  
right? Why is that? Michael Burger King, are like, they make

Unknown Speaker  1:19:03  
this. Sandwich

Speaker 1  1:19:09  
after there's an order. Okay, good, good, good. So basically, if I think about McDonald's, right, McDonald's, this is entirely, I'm going to call this MTS, for make to stop, right? Why? Because, as Michael says, they're going to make so many, you know, whatever. You know, Big Macs and so many you know, crispy chickens and this and that, right, based on traffic, they're going to kind of keep that right. That's it. They have a small, restricted menu. There's no customization. That's kind of what they're doing, right? This isn't quite make the stop,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:49  
right? So is this process?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:54  
Yeah, there?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57  
Well, is it fully made to order, though, I guess you

Speaker 7  1:20:01  
have the title of but then the assembly,

Speaker 1  1:20:05  
yeah, it's actually a pretty clever process, right? So, right? Like, it's sort of up to here and sort of make the stop, right? So basically, they say, look, here's this kind of, like vanilla burger, right? That I can specialize and, like, all my burgers come from this kind of base vanilla burger. So I'm going to make that the stock right, and the rest of this day is make the work

Unknown Speaker  1:20:30  
right. Now.

Speaker 1  1:20:31  
Why? Why? Why have they designed it differently? Like, what's what? Why do this? Like the guy who doesn't going to replicate this 5000 times, right? McDonald's feels faster

Unknown Speaker  1:20:40  
I mean, CSV specialization,

Speaker 1  1:20:44  
yeah. So if you try to think about this over here, designers may for a reason, right? They want to explicitly allow that flexibility. It's not just a marketing slogan, and so the process is set up in a way, so it's kind of geared towards that flexibility, right in the in the McDonald's case, even if they wanted to offer flexibility, they can't really, right? This process can't kind of be set up to offer, like, large amounts of flexibility, which is why just a second, which is why you got to go stand in the back of the line, right? So that's kind of the issue over here. Okay, so it's not like we see anything like blatantly wrong with the design of the system at 30, right? Like, I mean, it's designed for a reason. Maybe we can, like, tweak things here. Maybe we can tweak things, you know, on the on the margins, but this exists for a particular reason. Okay, so that's one. It's still taking too long, right? Maybe what else could be going on? Why is this location taking so long? The first thing we look at looks reasonable, right? Sure. Okay, it could be human errors, but that's sort of like human errors are just part and parcel of the whole thing, right? So I think where you're going is, you're sort of saying the right way to be thinking about this is, how many sandwiches can a human being produce? What is the

Unknown Speaker  1:22:08  
capacity of this process? Right?

Speaker 4  1:22:13  
Sandra thing, I cannot imagine myself as a part time the microphone gave me so many information that I'm going to be

Unknown Speaker  1:22:25  
okay, yeah, sure. Second

Speaker 4  1:22:26  
point is the supply chain was so bad that they need multiple times instead of McDonald's that they only one lock, one one week. They actually can do it. I mean, I guess it's like a

Speaker 1  1:22:36  
more pressure, yeah, but the supply chain issues happen on a weekly cadence. We're talking about delays that happen on, like, a hour to hour, minute to minute, business, right? Well, Mark, what? What's the simplest thing you might want to do to make this place faster is too slow? What should we do? Yeah. Shiva, right. Like, add more people. Like, if one person makes too many mistakes, fine, add a second person, right? Because on the margins, that's not that much money, right, relative to maybe how much we're leaving on the table in terms of market share and so on and so forth. So the question we have to ask ourselves is like, hey, how much capacity do we actually have? Like, do we have enough capacity? Okay, so we're at time, but let me take a little more of your time. Okay, I'm gonna steal a little bit of the break, right? Because I want to set up a puzzle for next time. Next time. Okay, so do we have enough capacity? Okay, so if I look at this burger king process, right, and I map out, you know what capacity is at this chain, okay, you can do eight burgers per minute, which is 480 burgers per hour, and you, or rather, you can do 5.5 Whoppers per minute, which is 330 Whoppers per hour. Now you can't do both, okay, so maybe you split your time, and you half the time you do burgers, half the time you do Whoppers, right? So if I sort of think about this chain over here, right? The chain can process 240 burgers, half of 40 per hour, and okay, 165 that's 330 divided by two Whoppers per hour. Okay, so basically, the process mistakes and all okay is such that I can process 240 burgers an hour and 165 Whoppers an hour. Okay? If I look at the assembly station, which is very human driven, we're told that these guys can do 200 burgers per hour and

Unknown Speaker  1:24:33  
100 Whoppers per hour.

Speaker 1  1:24:37  
Okay, so what's the overall capacity of this process? If I looked at this process as a whole, what's the overall capacity? Archer, the slowest point, right? The bottleneck. So suddenly came to you and said, I'm going to sell you a faster grilling machine. You have no interest in that, right? Because that's hardly the bottleneck. The bottleneck is this assembly thing, which is 200 burgers an hour and 100 Whoppers an hour, right? So if we're looking at the Burger King process as a process as like one big box, this box can push out at maximum capacity, 200 burgers now and 100 Whoppers, right? So we know that, okay, so we know that capacity, let's call it capacity, okay, it's 200 burgers per hour at 100 Whoppers per hour. Okay, so that's capacity. What should I look at next demand? But what demand? Peak demand, right? I want to look at peak demand. Okay, so I've done some calculations for peak demand, which I'll share with you carefully later. Okay, but I want to just tell you what the calculations ended up being, right? So when I looked at peak demand, okay, which was basically I calculated demand Friday on Fridays between 12 to 1pm okay, this is kind of peak time lunch on a Friday ends up being the busiest time of the week. Okay, so I did some calculations. The details hardly matter, but I'll share them with you, right? So when I look at Friday, 12 to one, okay, it turns out that they have demand for 79 Whoppers per hour, okay, and 146 burgers per hour. You. Okay, this is peak demand, right? So in particular, if I look at utilization, if I look at utilization, this is peak demand, okay, Friday, 12 to one, if I look at utilization, okay. And I'm going to use the letter rho for utilization, okay, so I'm going to call this utilization. Right rule for Whoppers is 79 Whoppers per hour of demand divided by what was the capacity for Whoppers? 100 Whoppers an hour, right? So 79 divided by 100 that's 79%

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59  
and grow burgers is 146 divided by 200 which is 73% okay, so that's that's a little weird, right? It gets weirder

Speaker 1  1:27:17  
if you do this same calculation for McDonald's. Don't worry about writing all this down. I'm gonna share all this. I just want you to absorb right? If you do the same calculation for McDonald's, okay? Here is the calculation for McDonald's. The utilization of quarter pounders is 40% the utilization for burgers is 40% same calculation looking at people. Okay, so this gets us to a bit of a weird spot on which I want to sort of end, right. So let's just go through what we did, right? Let's just go through, dude, I'm not going to get to you. Can put your hand down, right? So here's what I want to here's what we've covered. All right? Most important we talked about right defining product. We really got into finding a product from burgeoning and McDonald's. We said, look, a really important part of our definition of product is timelines, right? So, okay, how do we speed this up? One sort of thought, would just increase headphones to something like that, right? Now, we did the most responsible thing we could do, which is we looked at capacity and we looked at peak demand, we're finding that utilization is well below 100% in fact, at McDonald's, embarrassingly below that 40% I have a hard time making a kiss for extra capacity. So here's what I want you guys to chew on between today and tomorrow, what the hell's going on, right? Why would this be now? All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Thank you.
