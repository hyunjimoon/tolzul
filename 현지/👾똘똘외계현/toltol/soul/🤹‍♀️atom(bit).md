### 1. label $bit_t$
BE stands for bayesian entrepreneur, PC stands for probabilistic computing 

| past\future       | observer 👀                             | actor 🤜                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| effect of feature | describe [[def(BE_⬇️)]], [[def(PC_⬇️)]] | explain [[def(BE_⬆️)]]    |
| prediction        | predict [[def(PC_⬆️)]]                  | synthesize [[def(PC_🔃)]] |
- ⬆️, ⬇️, 🔃 is ability to act, think, think-then-act
- 🔃 requires time stone, which increases act-think clockspeed through simulation (detail in  [[W11_Stones and Gauntlet]])
- [[def(PC_⬇️)]] desires [[def(PC_🔃)]] and with easy-to-use tool, persuasion success rate would be over 50%
### 2. label $atom_t(bit_t)$
- [[def(BE_⬇️)]] is observer or actor using non-computerized human language (non-scalable approximation) to explain certain effect of feature
- [[def(BE_⬆️)]]  is actor choice of adapting before theorizing (industry mentors)
 
- [[def(PC_⬇️)]]  is observer choice of using measurement, econometrics, causal inference to explain effect of feature
- [[def(PC_🔃)]] s

### 3. persuade $atom_t(bit_t) \rightarrow atom_{t+1}(bit_{t})$
- order fastest to slowest clockspeed action and plan out change

### 4. persuade $atom_{t+1}(bit_t) \rightarrow atom_{t+1}(bit_{t+1})$ 

----
### 5. label $bit_{t+1}$
