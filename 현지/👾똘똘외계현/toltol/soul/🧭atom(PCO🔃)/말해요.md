세상이 등 돌릴 때  
내가 그대 편이라 말해요

불안한 내일이 그댈 아프게 할 때  
말해요 나에게

그대가 힘겨울 때  
날 알아주는 사람 있다 말해요

Love yourself and believe myself  
다 아는데 하지 못할 때도 있어  
Don't give up always be happy  
일어나란 말에 주저앉아도

세상에 딱 한 명 날 전부  
알아주면 되는 걸 충분해

모두가 등 돌릴 때  
그댄 내 편이라 말해요  
그대 말해줘요

Woo- Woo

Love yourself and believe myself  
그렇게 살 수 없는 나는 뭔지  
Don't give up always be happy  
또다시 넘어질까 두려울 때  
두려울 땐

지친 오늘 하루 내가 힘이 되었다 말해요  
말해요

한없이 작아져가는 내 마음들에게 말해요  
그대 말해줘요

### Structural Analysis

The lyrics of "말해요" follow a cyclical structure that spirals around a core human need for affirmation amidst emotional turmoil. The song begins by establishing the central problem or **Alert (A)**: the pain caused by anxiety and fear of the future. It then **Digs (D)** into the inadequacy of common self-help platitudes ("Love yourself," "Don't give up"), diagnosing a gap between intellectual understanding and emotional reality. The narrative then **Grows (G)** by proposing a tangible solution—not internal resilience alone, but the reciprocal act of hearing and providing verbal reassurance. This builds to the song's central thesis, its **Core (C)** insight: the profound and sufficient power of having a single person declare their unwavering support. The structure repeats, revisiting the fear and self-doubt but always returning to this core request, framing mutual affirmation as the essential, actionable remedy to loneliness and despair.

- **Motif:** Defined as a "small # of notes that recur". In the lyrics of "말해요," the central motif is the recurring phrase **"말해요" (Tell me)**. This simple, two-syllable plea appears throughout the song, acting as the primary lyrical hook and embodying the core request for affirmation.
    
- **Tune:** Defined as being "Singable, complete in itself, with a beginning, middle, and end". A distinct "tune" within the lyrics is the self-contained narrative of internal conflict:
    
    - **Beginning:** "Love yourself and believe myself" - The stanza begins by introducing a common piece of advice.
    - **Middle:** "다 아는데 하지 못할 때도 있어" (I know it all but sometimes I can't do it) - It presents the central conflict, the gap between knowledge and feeling.
    - **End:** "일어나란 말에 주저앉아도" (Even when I stumble at the words 'get up') - It concludes with the feeling of failure despite the advice, completing the mini-story of struggle.
        
- **Melody:** Defined as "Any # of successive pitches occurring in time". The overall melody of the lyrics is the song's complete narrative arc. It progresses from the initial pain of isolation ("세상이 등 돌릴 때" - When the world turns its back), moves through the inadequacy of generic platitudes, and resolves in the discovery that the affirmation from a single person is the sufficient and essential solution ("세상에 딱 한 명 날 전부 알아주면 되는 걸 충분해" - It's enough if just one person in the world understands me completely).
