## integrating the universe of sd tools
- better data architecture (code based tool)
- Bob, Billy (loops that matter) - research project (always the product in mind)
- if that was library (no-one would use it - ship it)
workflow (narrowing your)
heavy user (optimization MCMC) 
(xmile - diagramming features should be dropped)
node modules (chris) - python interface (javascript) 
- transfiling and converting (analysis)
- good model for doing this right (advanced)
- quality control (set of features) - post processing (ab comparisons, unit tests, msr (subscript) - statistical analysis) - sdm (eigen values, gradients; parallel compilation)
HMC retooled - generated model (pass simfiles on ) - distributed over parallel processes, (first derivatives, similar parallelization, )
1. creating the whole picture of what's 
1. problem to solve (user perspective) - purposeful policy (dive into the weeds)
2. what should trickle up to consumer to devote differently to policy
