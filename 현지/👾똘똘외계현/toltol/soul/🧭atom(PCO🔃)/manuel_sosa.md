1. Journal Choice "You edit both Management Science and MSOM - which journal for Newsvendor theory applied to entrepreneurial timing decisions?"

2. Methodology Framing "How do I best frame extending inventory theory into strategic management - emphasize the operations method or strategy impact?"

3. Ops-Strategy Bridge "What makes operations-strategy papers compelling to reviewers? How do I avoid the 'operations hammer, strategy nail' critique?"

  
  
  
  

The Problem: Entrepreneurs face critical timing decisions about whether to engage customers or resource partners first when building ventures. While Better Place's $850M infrastructure-first disaster contrasts with Tesla's customer-validation success, no systematic frameworks exist to guide this sequencing decision that dramatically influences survival rates.

The Gap: Existing Bayesian entrepreneurship theory focuses on unmeasurable "venture success probability," creating operationalization barriers for practical application.

Our Approach: We reframe entrepreneurial validation as a dual acceptance optimization problem using measurable binary states—"customer accepted? [yes/no]" and "resource partner accepted? [yes/no]"—then apply Newsvendor theory where resource-partner-first creates overage costs (unsold products) while customer-first creates underage costs (undelivered products).

Key Findings: Two counterintuitive effects emerge: (1) entrepreneurs should engage resource partners first even when customers are 40% easier to convince, provided underage costs exceed overage costs by 3:1 ratios; (2) when stakeholder acceptances are interdependent, persistence strategies outperform switching strategies in 73% of scenarios.

Contribution: We establish the first quantitative framework for entrepreneurial stakeholder sequencing, extending inventory theory into strategic management while providing immediately actionable decision rules.**
