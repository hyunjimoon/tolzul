Boom! You just got Greyballed,  
motherfucker!  
  
I-Is this legal?  
  
Are you an asshole?  
  
We wouldn't even  
be here tonight  
  
If it wasn't for  
Olivia Lungociu.  
  
What if we gave her  
a taste of her own medicine?  
  
Spend a million dollars  
to dig into her?  
  
How could you, Emil?  
  
I'm the one  
who put you in here.  
  
I'm the one who can  
take you out too.  
  
  
  
- What's going on?  
- I yelled.  
  
Travis, you can't do that.  
  
Yeah, I know. I know.  
  
I don't know what  
the fuck's wrong with me.  
  
I don't know why I keep  
doing that.  
  
Sometimes to get what you want,  
  
You got to give

There's no driver.

We sure as fuck are, man.

*SUPER PUMPED THE BATTLE FOR UBER *  
Season 01 Episode 16  
  
Episode Title: "Delete Uber"  
Aired on: April 03, 2022.  
  
Hello, everyone.  
  
I understand Mr. Kalanick  
is unable to join,  
  
but we know everything,  
  
And we have it all in here.  
  
So let's begin.  
  
"Force of Nature"  
by Pearl Jam plays  
  
Understand she's a force  
of nature  
  
Contraband hiding deep  
inside her soul  
  
Exercising her will  
to lose control  
  
These are just  
and reasonable demands  
  
Of righteous people.  
  
A man considers himself small  
  
Right up until the moment  
he bigs up.  
  
Atlas-style, Greek Titan,  
bodybuilder.  
  
Both motherfuckers apply.  
  
Inspiration from the back  
of a comic book  
  
Is not far off  
in this particular case.  
  
Can you believe this asshole?  
  
The case of Dan O'Sullivan.  
  
Chicago nobody  
versus the world.  
  
...so much  
unrealized potential.  
  
This American carnage  
stops right here  
  
And stops right now.  
  
Maybe we should turn this off,  
you know,  
  
Keep politics out of the office,  
like they said?  
  
CEO is on Trump's  
economic council.  
  
He brought politics  
to the office  
  
and dumped them  
like a colostomy bag  
  
right in the middle  
of the office.  
  
You're obsessed, man.  
And a little gross.  
  
Pretty sure we're all  
obsessed, or should be.  
  
You didn't get enough blow back  
from your company-wide email  
  
About TK  
signing on with Trump?  
  
I mean, that had to get HR  
all up in your face.  
  
My face is fine.  
  
You told me you got called  
into the office...  
  
I said it went fine.  
Travis is sucking the ass  
  
Of a fake fucking  
billionaire.  
  
Worry about what's ending up  
on his face,  
  
And I'll worry  
about him firing me.  
  
We've got to turn  
this sentiment around.  
  
No. I don't believe that.  
  
I don't see it. That's not fair.  
  
It's also wrong, by the way.  
But mostly it's unfair.  
  
You agreed to let us do  
our thing and then report back.  
  
- You agreed.  
- I changed my mind.  
  
- And I'm glad I did.  
- We're not doing this  
  
With you here,  
that's why it's an off site.  
  
Uber is not paying you  
to collect all of my bad press  
  
like some pissed-off girlfriend  
scrolling through our texts  
  
Trying to find the first time  
I was mean to her.  
  
Actually, that's exactly  
what they want, because this...  
  
Well, this says that people  
don't like you.  
  
It says that you are  
one dumb choice away  
  
from being a punchline  
buried in the third graph  
  
Of a late-night monologue.  
  
And who is "they"  
in your construct?  
  
I'm Uber, 'kay?  
  
And I don't see this.  
  
What I see is a mediocre  
comms team that's...  
  
Oh, no.  
  
What are you doing?  
  
What is it?  
  
My girls.  
  
Do it outside.  
Don't do it in my house.  
  
- Yeah, this is it, man.  
- Heck, yeah.  
  
- Yeah, all right.  
- Perfect.  
  
- Thank you.  
- Oh, this is really fucked up.  
  
I don't know if you remember me,  
you know, old faces, new faces.  
  
2010.  
  
- Thanks for all the work you do.  
- You dropped the prices.  
  
I... I didn't drop the prices  
on Black.  
  
You can have  
the prices you want,  
  
But you choose to give  
everybody a ride.  
  
Okay, no, here's the thing  
about that.  
  
We can do Lux  
in San Francisco.  
  
I got guys working on Lux  
right now.  
  
That's gonna be 50 to 70%  
more expensive.  
  
But people are not  
trusting you anymore.  
  
You think people want to buy  
black cars anymore?  
  
Nobody wants  
to buy a black car.  
  
I lost $97,000  
because of you.  
  
Yes. I'm bankrupt  
because of you.  
  
Yes, come on. Yes.  
You keep changing every day.  
  
- Hold on. Hold on a second.  
- You keep changing every day.  
  
What have I changed about Black?  
  
- You changed the whole business.  
- What?  
  
- You dropped the prices.  
- That... not on Black.  
  
- No, that's bullshit. That...  
- Yes. Yes, you did.  
  
No, I didn't.  
  
We are thrilled  
to have you exclusive to Uber.  
  
- Twenty dollars a mile?  
- Yeah.  
  
And the price for the rider  
stays the same.  
  
We just appreciate  
your loyalty.  
  
- That is bullshit. Bullshit!  
- We're talking dollars per mile.  
  
- What is the mile now, $2.75?  
- You know what?  
  
Some people just can't take  
responsibility  
  
- For their own shit.  
- I take responsibility.  
  
And they have to blame  
everything in their life  
  
- On somebody else.  
- You sent an email.  
  
- Come on, you sent an email...  
- Good luck.  
  
Good luck to you, but I know  
  
- You're not gonna go far.  
- Jesus, turn it off.  
  
This is really bad.  
That's really bad.  
  
That's really bad.  
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!  
  
Fuck! What is wrong with me?  
  
It's being picked up by Olivia.  
It's on WSJ's site.  
  
Is anyone calling us  
for comment?  
  
No.  
  
- That's not good.  
- Mnh-mnh.  
  
Uh, Arianna?  
Hi, it's, uh, Travis.  
  
Can you call me back?  
  
Um, look, actually,  
can you just come get me?  
  
I'm...  
  
Never mind just, uh, call.  
Thanks.  
  
This is Bonnie Kalanick.  
  
Please leave me a message,  
  
And I'll get back to you.  
  
Hi, Mom.  
  
Um, can you just  
call me back?  
  
I, um... I'm not gonna...  
  
...be able  
to make it up to the house.  
  
Things are complicated here.  
  
But if anyone calls you  
about a video,  
  
Just hang up and call  
Penny or Kelsey, okay?  
  
And don't watch it.  
  
I'm fixing this.  
  
I am.  
  
Some people just don't want  
to take responsibility.  
  
I take responsibility.  
You sent an email.  
  
They gotta blame everything  
in their life on somebody else.  
  
- Bill.  
- We have a problem.  
  
Yes. We do.  
  
I just spoke with Travis.  
  
He needs our support  
with that bogus video  
  
of him and the driver.  
  
Can I count on the board?  
  
Well, I appreciate you  
reaching out  
  
To get ourselves  
aligned on this.  
  
This is a-a bad situation  
  
On top of a lot  
of bad choices, Arianna.  
  
He's surrounded  
by the wrong people.  
  
Well, I'd love to,  
  
but we make the wrong move  
in response,  
  
It's gonna look  
like panic.  
  
It was lovely  
to chat with you.  
  
I'm confident we will  
find a solution.  
  
No, ma'am.  
  
It's always my pleasure  
speaking with you on the phone.  
  
This video is data.  
  
And you're the data guy, right?  
  
So tell me where the lie is.  
  
Now tell me, what part  
of what you said isn't true?  
  
You can't, can you?  
  
- No.  
- No.  
  
And what's our valuation  
right now?  
  
Sixty-nine billion.  
  
What was it when you started  
with Ryan and Garrett?  
  
- One point six million.  
- It was.  
  
That's one point six.  
  
That's a dick lint number.  
  
And who did that?  
  
Which guy on the screen?  
  
That guy wouldn't have a job  
if it weren't for that guy.  
  
Okay?  
  
You didn't tell him  
to make the choices he made.  
  
You gave him opportunity.  
  
The most American thing ever.  
  
Fly the flag,  
salute the fireworks,  
  
Baseball and hot dogs.  
  
That's you.  
  
Apple fucking pie, right?  
  
And we don't outsource  
the work either.  
  
I'm not Tim fucking Cook,  
sending jobs off to China.  
  
And we're a global brand.  
  
But we create jobs locally,  
globally.  
  
Damn fucking straight.  
  
Fuck what people  
say about you.  
  
The only things that count  
are revenue and riders.  
  
We got to get Levandowski to get  
us those driver less cars sooner.  
  
What'd he say it's gonna be?  
  
- Two years.  
- Yeah, no.  
  
You gotta tell him 18 months.  
That is what we need.  
  
Driver less cars in 18 months.  
It's cheaper. It's faster.  
  
It's safer.  
  
Cutting edge, man.  
  
No more of these wars  
with fucking drivers.  
  
Hey, we're gonna get you  
through this.  
  
And then you're gonna keep  
changing the world.  
  
Yeah. Hell, yeah.  
  
What?  
  
"Are you okay?"  
  
"I'm so sorry  
you're going through this."  
  
"He's an asshole."  
I've got a lot of those.  
  
A lot of "Dump his ass," too.  
  
People asking me if it was  
taken before we met,  
  
Which of course,  
they know it wasn't.  
  
They just, I don't know,  
want me to make them feel like  
  
they can comfort  
the sad girl  
  
Who was stupid enough  
to believe you.  
  
People are mad at me  
'cause of the video,  
  
And they're taking it out  
on you. That's all.  
  
No, they saw you  
in the back of a car  
  
with a couple of miniskirts  
and heels,  
  
And they think that  
you're cheating on me.  
  
But you know it's not that.  
It's just I need to be seen...  
  
That's the problem.  
  
You think that you need  
to be seen.  
  
You know, my uncle used  
to watch these infomercials,  
  
This real estate scam course.  
  
"How to Make Money Now."  
This guy named Tom Vu.  
  
He always had six bikini models  
either side of him on a yacht.  
  
Uncle lost a lot of money  
to that scammer.  
  
And I laughed at him.  
  
And now I am living with Tom Vu,  
and everybody else...  
  
- What...  
- ...is laughing at me.  
  
What do you want me to say?  
  
I want you to give me  
  
Some sort of reason to stay.  
  
'Cause being with you  
  
Is making me feel  
ugly and awful.  
  
Sorry, just...  
  
Fuck.  
  
Forget it.  
  
I'm moving out in the morning.  
  
You're gonna move out on me  
  
in the middle of the worst  
crisis of my career  
  
Because of a video with me  
and some fully clothed women?  
  
I'm sorry, it's just sometimes  
it's so clear that you're 24.  
  
Gabi dumped me.  
  
What's the plan for Uber?  
  
I want to bring someone in  
to help with culture.  
  
You just said "culture"  
without making a face.  
  
Yeah, I made it on the inside.  
  
You want me to do it?  
  
You said you would before.  
  
You know me.  
  
You know how to fix things  
without making them worse.  
  
I just need a list  
of shit to do,  
  
and then I'll do that shit,  
  
And then people can stop  
freaking out.  
  
Maybe start with not yelling  
at your drivers,  
  
Especially the ones  
with dashcams.  
  
That's what you got for me?  
  
If I come,  
it has to be real.  
  
You pay me as a consultant,  
and you give me complete access.  
  
You take the changes seriously.  
  
Nah, it's a dumb idea.  
  
You investigating me?  
Be too weird.  
  
You like me too much.  
  
Yeah, you're probably right.  
  
I'll stick with the bio tech  
cancer drug thing.  
  
Not a good idea for the CEO  
to take time off  
  
To investigate another company.  
  
You good, though?  
  
I want you to be good.  
  
I'd be better  
if you made me whole.  
  
Why don't you just give me  
a fucking number,  
  
So we can stop  
having this conversation?  
  
A hundred million.  
  
There.  
  
Now you have a number.  
  
Okay.  
  
Let me see  
what I can figure out.  
  
Nothing to figure.  
  
We both know what I contributed  
is worth way more than that.  
  
Meanwhile, hire someone.  
  
Do something to take back  
control of the narrative  
  
Before it eats you.  
  
We just need to pull Uber  
over to pit row,  
  
Get it fixed up,  
back out there fast.  
  
We do this internally.  
We do it this weekend.  
  
Any attempt to self-diagnose  
will be met with ridicule.  
  
By everybody, myself included.  
  
We need... someone trustworthy  
to come in.  
  
You're on board?  
  
Only if Travis agrees to listen  
to every recommendation.  
  
Wait, hold on.  
  
Is this investigation  
theater or for real?  
  
Amateurs love the profits,  
hate the process.  
  
We need a new story.  
  
We need you guys  
to get it out there  
  
that we're taking this  
seriously,  
  
and we're making changes.  
  
I feel like I'm going crazy.  
  
Are we taking this seriously  
and making changes?  
  
Yes. Legit. We need somebody  
with gravitas.  
  
That is how strongly  
I believe in this, okay?  
  
Now when you were  
at the White House,  
  
Who scared the shit out of you  
that wasn't named Obama?  
  
Eric Holder.  
  
There you go. Perfect.  
  
- Get him. He's a lawyer, right?  
- No, no, no.  
  
That guy's a laser-focused  
wrecking ball, Travis.  
  
Exactly. People know his name.  
He inspires fear.  
  
Are you telling me  
that you can't sell  
  
"Uber investigated  
by Eric Holder" to the press?  
  
We can sell it.  
  
It's just once you put  
a force like this in motion,  
  
It might not go  
the way you think.  
  
Oh, not worried about that.  
  
I can work him.  
  
I can! He should be here  
and hired already.  
  
Come on. Let's fix this.  
  
Percussive beat  
  
I'm establishing  
new vetting measures  
  
to keep radical  
Islamic terrorists  
  
Out of the United States  
of America.  
  
We don't want them here.  
  
All the cabs are refusing  
to work and our app shows  
  
at minimum 60-minute wait  
  
For JFK Terminals  
three through six.  
  
Surge pricing is at  
four times the normal cost.  
  
At some point  
people will just take...  
  
What? The train?  
  
Have you ever taken a train  
to JFK?  
  
No. Nobody has.  
  
How many rides you think  
we're losing to this?  
  
Turn off surge pricing.  
  
Push "notify everyone  
in the area."  
  
We stand with our passengers.  
  
Our man, Dan.  
  
This particular  
Chicago-based punk  
  
is about to scream  
"I want to be anarchy"  
  
Right into Uber's face.  
  
It's one man  
and a motherfucking microphone.  
  
And in this case,  
  
That microphone is Twitter.  
  
Guy hits send.  
  
Guy thinks nothing'll happen.  
  
What good can  
140 characters do?  
  
But sometimes...  
  
Sometimes this shit  
hits like nitrate.  
  
Just the right thing  
at just the right time.  
  
Who the hell told them to stop  
surge pricing in New York?  
  
Okay, you seem a little bit...  
  
I seem what? Furious?  
  
Because in the face  
of the Muslim ban,  
  
which affects taxi drivers,  
and, yes, our drivers,  
  
Someone in New York ops  
decided to play strikebreaker?  
  
No one broke any strikes.  
That's not what happened.  
  
Did you fucking authorize  
dropping the surge pricing?  
  
Maybe you or someone else  
  
thought it might seem  
magnanimous  
  
not to charge people more.  
  
But if you thought about it  
for one fucking second...  
  
I didn't authorize shit.  
  
I didn't send the tweet.  
  
Okay, then fire  
whoever the fuck did.  
  
So we should be gouging people?  
  
We should be profiting  
off this protest?  
  
To avoid being racist, yeah.  
  
Wasn't this just Uber  
offering people a way to support  
  
the striking taxi drivers  
  
So they wouldn't have to cross  
a protest line?  
  
Don't spin me.  
  
The company took  
the opportunity to book rides.  
  
You don't fucking think,  
Travis.  
  
I'm gonna treat you  
like a driver right now.  
  
Like one of those drivers  
that I signed  
  
By telling them how to go about  
making their lives better.  
  
And I'm gonna tell you  
what's fucking best for you  
  
And what's best for the United  
fucking States of America.  
  
So now you're speaking  
for the whole country.  
  
Exactly. And you need  
to actually take responsibility.  
  
More than running my company?  
  
Quit the president's  
economic council.  
  
Distance yourself.  
  
The majority of our drivers  
are immigrants,  
  
Not just in this country,  
which you know.  
  
You just went viral  
for berating one.  
  
Okay, look, you don't like  
the president.  
  
Guess what? Neither do I.  
  
The difference is,  
you're gonna complain about it.  
  
I'm gonna walk  
into the White House  
  
And have influence,  
and protect what we built.  
  
What you're doing  
is dicking around.  
  
You need to start listening  
to the people here.  
  
You know, the people that helped  
you build this company.  
  
Because the people here,  
they hate him.  
  
And they are starting  
to really hate you.  
  
Vocalist sings indistinctly  
  
Eric Himpton Holder, Jr.  
  
First Black attorney general  
of these United States,  
  
shoulder to shoulder  
with B. Hussein Obama  
  
Through the best  
and worst of it.  
  
But if you think  
he's riding shotgun  
  
For one side or the other,  
no, sir.  
  
This gentleman was first made  
a federal judge  
  
By none other than  
handsome Ron Reagan himself.  
  
And, no, I ain't gonna swear  
in front of him  
  
Because I have respect.  
  
Maybe even a little fear.  
  
And so should you.  
  
Mr. Holder.  
  
Mr. Kalanick.  
  
How's San Francisco  
treating you?  
  
You know what?  
  
We have got to get you  
in to Arianna and Robin.  
  
Actually, you let me know  
what you want to eat.  
  
I'll make the calls.  
  
Travis, we will talk  
at the end of this process.  
  
Before that, if you see me,  
  
Say hi, and that's it.  
  
I don't work for you.  
  
You are not my client.  
  
Uber is my client.  
  
That's one and the same.  
  
See, now, that's why  
we shouldn't be talking,  
  
because you might  
say something like that,  
  
And then I might  
have to write it down.  
  
For this to work, you can have  
no control over what I find out.  
  
You let me know  
about those reservations.  
  
President Trump's travel  
  
and immigration crackdown  
  
on people from the seven  
Muslim-majority countries  
  
has caused chaos  
and confusion...  
  
Fuck this fucking company  
and its absolute bullshittery.  
  
Fuck all of you.  
  
We've got trouble.  
  
Right here in River City.  
  
My mom likes Music Man.  
Sorry, go.  
  
The Levandowski mess.  
  
We tried to fend off the lawsuit  
over Levandowski and his tech.  
  
Google is not interested  
in talking.  
  
Talking meaning settlement.  
  
They want to go to court.  
  
We need to cut  
Levandowski loose.  
  
Half the shit that Google uses  
  
Is stuff they're accused  
of stealing.  
  
They do it all the time.  
Just keep doing it  
  
'Cause they're Google,  
they're a monolith.  
  
But... isn't Uber the fucking  
monolith now?  
  
Why should I have to cower?  
  
Why is Larry Page up my ass  
about this thing?  
  
You know, another  
time, another situation,  
  
maybe we ask that question,  
  
But right now  
you're grappling with bad press.  
  
Page knows it,  
and he's taking advantage.  
  
So it's my fault?  
  
Mm.  
Fault is for after.  
  
Right now we need action.  
  
Specifically,  
  
we need you  
to fire Levandowski,  
  
make Page think  
he's gotten to us.  
  
Maybe he calms down.  
  
You do that, you throw away  
the future of the company.  
  
Well, if it makes you feel  
any better,  
  
Levandowski's technology's  
been burned.  
  
Nobody gets it,  
including and especially Lyft.  
  
Does that make you feel  
any better?  
  
No, none of this is good.  
  
It's what you call triage,  
Travis.  
  
You're the guy  
dying of liver failure.  
  
I'm the guy trying to help you  
kick the bottle.  
  
Okay, if the smell of death  
is in the air,  
  
It's not wafting off of me.  
  
I'm alive and doing the thing.  
  
I brought in Holder.  
I'm solving this.  
  
Let's give him a week  
to finish his work, right?  
  
I'd really like Holder's report  
to say that you saw a problem  
  
and you fixed it,  
not that you saw a problem  
  
And you waited  
for it to go away.  
  
It's a big difference.  
  
I shouldn't have said yes  
to this.  
  
The only thing  
standing between us  
  
And total domination  
is the fucking drivers, man.  
  
We replace them,  
we own transportation.  
  
Keep Levandowski,  
  
We all get sucked into  
this lawsuit like a black hole.  
  
Yeah.  
  
End of game.  
  
I can't.  
  
What?  
  
I care too much.  
  
You know me, man.  
I'll get out there,  
  
I'll convince him  
we should keep fighting.  
  
You do it.  
  
Yeah.  
  
This is Bonnie Kalanick.  
  
Please leave me a message  
and I'll get back to you.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Self-driving mode deactivated.  
  
- Hey, man...  
- Test vehicle in standby.  
  
TK couldn't nut up, huh?  
  
He hates this.  
  
He really does.  
  
Yeah.  
  
Clearly.  
  
You didn't even cover  
your tracks.  
  
When you take a dump  
  
on your ex-girlfriend's lawn,  
  
You want her to know it was you,  
not the Great Dane next door.  
  
Okay, well,  
I don't do that.  
  
We all do that.  
  
In one way or another.  
  
So if you're looking for me  
to throw myself  
  
On the mercy of the whatever  
the hell you are, no, thanks.  
  
You're gonna turn  
the money spout off  
  
And lose your only shot  
at driver less cars.  
  
We are.  
  
How the hell can I steal  
something I created?  
  
That's lawyer bullshit.  
  
That's not laws of nature.  
  
These fucking people,  
  
holding me and Travis  
to this standard,  
  
like we're average,  
  
Like those standards apply.  
  
People like me and TK,  
  
we have the ability  
to make the world better,  
  
and applying  
conventional morality  
  
To the world's most  
brilliant minds is insanity.  
  
They don't deserve you.  
  
But we can't keep you.  
  
Tell Travis to get out  
of the car next time.  
  
- It's done?  
- Yeah.  
  
He gets it.  
  
Great, so now we just  
have to deal  
  
with fucking drivers  
for the next decade  
  
Till someone else figures out  
the final solution.  
  
Just kidding.  
  
Dude, I'm kidding.  
Come on, obviously, I'm...  
  
I'm hurting over here.  
  
Jesus.  
  
Can we go?  
  
Hey, guys, I, uh,  
  
I just got a call  
from someone at Bloomberg.  
  
He is sourcing a story about  
a karaoke bar in South Korea.  
  
What do I need  
to get in front of?  
  
Is this the Asia trip?  
  
♪ We come together ♪  
  
♪ So let's touch the sky ♪  
  
♪ Let's touch the sky ♪  
  
Let it take us higher...  
  
I am a golden god!  
  
Of what, exactly?  
  
That's it,  
you're buying the drinks.  
  
You're not buying the drinks.  
You're using the corporate card.  
  
So I'm buying the drinks  
like always, right?  
  
Hey, I want to sing Madonna.  
  
You get to sing  
whatever you want to sing.  
  
We get this whole place  
to ourselves.  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
There's a story about me  
singing "Drunk in Love"?  
  
You did sing the Beyoncé part.  
  
- Yeah.  
- So we're fine.  
  
Unless you want to hear me  
sing the harmonies.  
  
Is this a thing?  
  
'Cause this can't be another  
story that I get blamed for.  
  
You were with me.  
  
It's not remotely a thing.  
  
Did he ask you to call me?  
  
No, no.  
  
Right, of course.  
  
You okay?  
  
Did you find a place?  
  
Yeah, I think so.  
  
It's, um, a bit far from things,  
  
But it's got a small yard,  
so that's...  
  
Great. Great.  
  
Do you, uh, remember  
that karaoke night in Seoul?  
  
Hey, I want to sing Madonna.  
  
You can sing anything you want.  
  
We got this whole place  
to ourselves.  
  
Okay, everyone. It's time.  
  
Pick a number, any number.  
  
But not 14. She's mine.  
  
What? They, like,  
help you sing?  
  
Well, more like they, uh,  
make you sing.  
  
Seven.  
  
'Cause she looks like you.  
  
Hey.  
  
Closest you're gonna get.  
  
Ten, thirteen, twelve, eleven.  
  
These are some  
of my lucky numbers.  
  
Uh, yeah.  
You, you, you and you.  
  
Sure four's probably enough.  
  
Like the hoop earrings.  
Glasses are nice.  
  
Babe, you ready?  
  
I'm gonna hang back at the bar  
with Sonya and have a drink.  
  
What about it?  
  
Yeah, I only wanted to warn you,  
you know, so you're prepared.  
  
And if a reporter  
or anyone comes around,  
  
It'll be really cool if you just  
let them know nothing happened.  
  
I don't think I can do that.  
  
Yeah, I get that you and,  
you know,  
  
Trav are taking a break.  
  
But you don't want to hurt him,  
and I know how fragile you are.  
  
I just want to be left  
out of all of this, okay?  
  
Can you just not mention me?  
  
It's... it's not up to me.  
Come on, let's figure out...  
  
- Please, okay, I...  
- ...now, so it's clear.  
  
I'm gonna hang up, all right?  
Just, don't...  
  
No, Gab. Gab.  
  
That's not  
what I would have done.  
  
Yeah, that's 'cause you  
don't do anything.  
  
- You're not an action guy...  
- Guys.  
  
The moron has rewritten  
the user deletion logic  
  
To batch delete users.  
  
I had to, since there are so  
many happening at the same time.  
  
He doesn't understand,  
and so I'm here trying to work.  
  
Okay. Tell me why you 911'ed.  
  
Hashtag "delete Uber."  
After your bullshit move at JFK.  
  
Yo!  
  
Users are trying to delete  
their whole accounts.  
  
- We usually get a dozen a week...  
- Not even.  
  
- But we're at...  
- A hundred thousand.  
  
Fuck, you guys. Fuck.  
  
And that's not counting  
the full app deleters,  
  
Which we won't know  
until Apple releases met a data.  
  
We're trending on Twitter.  
  
Steadily going up,  
  
Even after Austin restored  
surge pricing.  
  
We need a full engineering team  
in here to handle the overload.  
  
Uh, no.  
  
We are frictionless,  
  
but not if you want  
to delete us  
  
Just because  
of a goddamn hashtag.  
  
Okay, but that friction  
will crash the app.  
  
The platform. All of it.  
Nobody will be able to ride.  
  
Fuck, you guys.  
  
Fuck!  
  
All right, do it.  
Get whoever you need.  
  
What do you think?  
  
A little midnight spin?  
  
Oh.  
  
All that noise,  
this late at night?  
  
We'll get stink eye  
from everyone on the lake.  
  
Oh, no.  
  
You ready to talk to him?  
  
He's not gonna like  
what I have to say.  
  
Hi.  
  
Hey, Mom, you're awake.  
  
That's, uh, good.  
  
I... listen, I...  
  
Things aren't going so well...  
  
- ...and, um...  
- Hey, Trav.  
  
The reason I didn't  
pick up before  
  
is because this  
is the whining time,  
  
And I'm gonna talk to you  
in the fixing time.  
  
No, I'm fixing it right now.  
  
So you keep saying.  
  
I am.  
  
I just wanted  
to talk it through a lit...  
  
The laundry list of complaints  
  
Can go on my voicemail.  
  
I know what it sounds like  
  
When you actually  
take responsibility.  
  
And, um, I'll be here  
when that happens.  
  
You...  
  
He mad?  
  
He's fine.  
  
Yeah, he's, uh...  
  
He's working  
through his stuff.  
  
Listen, Gabs,  
  
Just call me, okay?  
  
I'm worried about you.  
  
Don't be stupid, Gabs.  
  
I don't want you  
to be blindsided.  
  
I'm not even sure  
I can stop what's happen...  
  
If you go against me on this,  
  
Stuff about you  
is gonna come out.  
  
Hello?  
  
I have to tell you  
about something.  
  
Okay.  
  
You should write this down.  
  
Okay.  
  
Um, just hang on.  
  
Uh, don't hang up.  
Just hang on.  
  
Okay, I'm ready.  
  
This is about Korea.  
  
Okay.  
  
The other woman at the bar went  
to HR, but nothing came of it.  
  
And now Gabi's gonna go  
to the press,  
  
And I have no reason  
to tell her not to.  
  
She said Travis was...  
  
They left after they had  
one drink,  
  
because Gabi didn't want  
to go back  
  
into one of those rooms,  
  
Along with the other  
female exec.  
  
But the remaining company  
personnel didn't...  
  
Mm-mm.  
  
This one falls on Emil.  
  
The second he picked up  
that phone to call her.  
  
Intimidation. Coercion.  
  
We keep disarming  
land mines,  
  
And he's just out there  
creating new ones.  
  
I'm leaving.  
  
And what does talking you  
into staying look like?  
  
A time machine  
and a bottle of scotch.  
  
Uber's Jurassic Park.  
  
If the T. Rex  
doesn't tear you apart,  
  
The New York Times will.  
  
Get everyone you love out  
  
And let's just hope  
the dinosaurs eat each other.  
  
Hey.  
  
- Here.  
- Oh, thank you.  
  
What's this?  
  
I'm the one  
that's in the shit.  
  
I'm the one  
fixing the drinks.  
  
I can't argue with that.  
  
Are you sure?  
  
You seem to be in the midst  
of one hell of an argument.  
  
I am, with myself.  
  
I did this.  
  
If I didn't,  
I sure as hell helped.  
  
I tried to put a goat  
in the barn  
  
To keep my thoroughbred calm.  
  
Instead, there was some kind of a  
toxic chemical reaction  
  
That happened  
between the two of them.  
  
So he needs to be removed.  
  
Emil, he's not your founder.  
  
Excise him with clean margins  
like the malignancy he is.  
  
Cut him out.  
  
Don't just sit there  
blaming yourself.  
  
You be you and keep trying.  
  
You'll figure it.  
  
He's expecting your call.  
  
- Can we just wait for one minute...?  
- No.  
  
No, we can't.  
You have a slot, Travis.  
  
We are on his timetable,  
not yours.  
  
- Okay.  
- Hang on. Hang on. There you go.  
  
- He's on right now?  
- No, just give it a minute.  
  
Hey, Mr. President, sir.  
  
I'm very well, thank you.  
  
Listen, I am calling  
to let you know  
  
I'll be stepping down  
from the economic council.  
  
It was my honor to...  
  
He hung up.  
  
Well, maybe if you're lucky,  
  
this gets reported  
as you listening  
  
to your customers  
or employees.  
  
Maybe we start to get out  
of this tailspin.  
  
I am not optimistic.  
  
You're not... why the fuck did  
I just throw away my Face Time  
  
with the president?  
  
The board convenes  
this afternoon  
  
In Los Angeles  
with Holder.  
  
Hold on, he's done?  
  
And we go to him?  
  
Yeah. They're reading it  
at his law firm.  
  
No PDFs. Dead trees only.  
  
Your plane will be ready  
in two hours.

But we know everything,

So let's begin.  
  
Sexism, lying,  
lack of diversity.  
  
These are all bad enough,  
but it's only the beginning.  
  
Yeah. Section Two: Driver  
violence against passengers.  
  
Section Five: Sexual predation  
done by drivers.  
  
Section Six: Sexual predation  
in the Uber offices.

You were good to come.  
  
I can't believe  
she's dead.  
  
She loved you.  
  
She loved you both,  
so much.  
  
She always talked about you.

Emil?  
  
You okay with this?  
  
At this point,  
all we owe him is a heads-up.  
  
And by "we,"  
I assume you mean the Board.  
  
No.  
  
Me talking to him doesn't  
show you taking responsibility.  
  
This needs to come  
from you first.  
  
The Board needs to see you stand  
behind Holder's recommendations.  
  
Or?  
  
The Board stops  
standing behind you.  
  
You ever fire anyone before?  
  
No one that mattered.  
  
Tell him what the meeting  
is about right away.  
  
You're gonna want to make him  
feel better, because...  
  
well, despite  
your past behavior,  
  
You're not actually  
a sociopath.  
  
Make it clean and quick.  
  
Hey, you okay?  
  
Your dad okay?  
  
Yeah, thanks.  
You can come in.  
  
So you talked to Gabi  
about South Korea.  
  
Well...  
  
She must be pissed if she's  
calling you to complain.  
  
No, she didn't call me, dude.  
She called someone else.  
  
That's the problem.  
  
Oh...  
  
Fuck.  
  
Off site.  
  
Ten o'clock at night,  
  
Nobody to hear  
if I start yelling.  
  
Where is Gurley, hmm?  
  
Skulking with, uh,  
Cohler and Fenton  
  
In legal down the hall?  
  
Yeah, something like that.  
  
You're extending me  
the courtesy.  
  
It's always a friend  
who does it.  
  
The Holder Report  
  
specifically recommends  
your removal.  
  
The Board's voting on it  
in the morning.  
  
I didn't realize  
you could be fired  
  
for asking someone's  
ex-girlfriend to tell the truth.  
  
Well, it's not just  
South Korea.  
  
I mean,  
there is a pattern.  
  
There's India, there's  
the fuck up at the Waverly.  
  
I was off  
the fucking record!  
  
Do you think I want to be  
doing this right now?  
  
To lose you? I don't, okay?  
  
But I cannot let anything  
take me down.  
  
Not even you.  
  
If there's something  
that could kill Uber,  
  
Then it's my job to remove it.  
  
It's fucking bullshit.  
  
And the sad thing is,  
  
You're gonna want  
to talk to me about this.  
  
About everything  
that's about to come down.  
  
And I don't know if I'm gonna  
pick up the phone.  
  
Jesus.  
  
Fuck, my mom just died.  
  
You're not gonna  
pick up the phone?  
  
- Man, fuck you!  
- Fuck. Okay, I'm sorry.  
  
Of course. Of course.  
  
Of course, man.  
  
I'm sorry you're  
in this situation.  
  
You know what? I'm sorry.  
  
You're always gonna be  
Team Uber.  
  
You are.  
  
Always.  
  
Always.  
  
But I got to back  
the Board's decision.  
  
You're out.  
  
Best we can hope for  
is that he walks away,  
  
stays quiet for a few days.  
  
Mortification  
can be a silencer.  
  
Yeah, or he gets angry,  
  
he starts talking about  
how I signed off  
  
on all those mistakes,  
  
How he's throwing his body  
in front of a bullet.  
  
I'll make sure the Board knows  
that you took care of it.  
  
They'll endorse  
a leave of absence for you.  
  
How long you been  
planning all this?  
  
It's not like that.  
  
It's a leave.  
It's not an insurrection.  
  
You just need to go away  
for a while.  
  
Let us clean up the mess,  
then we'll bring you back in.  
  
I'll make sure that the Board  
is clear on the statement  
  
That it's not permanent.  
  
So I'll get to see the press  
release before it goes out.  
  
You're gonna come back  
stronger, I promise you.  
  
This is the chapter in  
your memoir where you reassess.  
  
It's all wins after this.  
  
I'll write the introduction  
for you.  
  
Travis back in Fresno?  
  
Far from here, yes.  
  
Leave of absence  
starts tonight.  
  
He take it okay?  
  
He took it.  
  
That's all that matters to us.  
  
Can we please gather?  
  
I would like to thank you all  
  
On behalf of the Uber board  
for being here.  
  
Our culture has taken ill,  
  
But we've called upon  
a great healer.  
  
Let's talk about  
our recommendations  
  
from Eric Holder.  
  
I am passionate  
about redemption,  
  
which is why I can state  
with authority  
  
that Travis is on a path  
that will save this company.  
  
And to that end,  
he has something to say.  
  
Thank you, Arianna.  
  
The last eight years of my life  
has only been about Uber.  
  
Recent events  
have brought home for me  
  
that people are more important  
than work,  
  
and I need to take some time off  
from the day-to-day  
  
to grieve my mother,  
to take care of my father,  
  
to work on myself,  
  
And to focus on building out  
a world-class leadership team.  
  
I mean, the team we had...  
  
The ultimate responsibility  
for where we've gotten  
  
And how we've gotten here  
rests on my shoulders.  
  
But if we're gonna work  
on Uber 2.0,  
  
I also need to work  
on Travis 2.0.  
  
In case this one  
was confusing,  
  
Emil Michael has been removed  
  
By unanimous vote  
of the Board.  
  
This is just  
absolutely brainless.  
  
They fired Himmler to make  
Hitler seem less culpable.  
  
You hate working here  
that much?  
  
- It's a trade-off.  
- You want to do the best work,  
  
The shit nobody else will  
let you do, actually disrupt?  
  
Then you gotta work  
with people  
  
Who give you enough room  
to do that.  
  
- And sometimes they're...  
- Assholes.  
  
Yeah.  
  
The next recommendations,  
  
Well, they're all about culture.  
  
Always Be Hustling?  
  
Not anymore.  
  
I'm gonna go  
to the bathroom.

do our best work,
