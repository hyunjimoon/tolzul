You just get out of the car,

- Tip?  
- No. Our rev share's  
  
So good, our drivers  
don't need tips.  
  
Uber has some  
very special incentives.  
  
Twenty dollars a mile?  
  
Yeah. Thrilled to have you  
exclusive to Uber.  
  
New plan:  
We're gonna step up  
  
the information technology  
on our drivers.  
  
  
  
You mean surveillance?  
  
We don't have to use  
words like that.  
  
- Might cross a line.  
- So far I can't get anyone to talk.  
  
There's dirt out there.  
I brought a shovel.  
  
Why do you have

Our founder just raised

There is nowhere near  
enough fear  
  
In Silicon Valley  
right now.  
  
I think you will see  
some dead unicorns this year.  
  
You're VC's, you're supposed  
to actually believe  
  
in the company  
that you put money into,  
  
not just protect yourself

you made the wrong call.

I mean, sorry, wait.  
Can I curse? I'm gonna curse.  
  
If I'm Patton, is my point,  
then my drivers are my army.  
  
My family. Really, la famiglia.  
Uber's one big family.  
  
The drivers, the executives,  
the investors, Google Ventures,  
  
They just came in heavy.  
  
Biggest investment  
they have ever made.  
  
That's how radical  
our vision is.  
  
Yeah  
  
You know he ain't gonna die  
  
Por favor! Não!

I wouldn't really say

I mean, what?  
  
Big taxi?  
  
Crooked city legislators?  
  
- Clone startups?  
- You're referring to Lyft.  
  
Uh, you won't hear me  
say that name.  
  
But, yeah, fuck Lyft.  
Fuck those guys.  
  
I mean, we beat them.  
Shook up the world and all that.  
  
But it's ancient history,  
really.  
  
It's from Uber's  
primordial era.  
  
It's pretty recent.  
  
Shit moves quick in the cut.  
  
So, what's next?  
  
World domination. Legit.  
  
Our next app update comes  
in 12 different languages.  
  
We're launching  
in Southeast Asia, China.  
  
Uber's gonna be ubiquitous  
across the globe.  
  
Transportation as reliable  
as running water.  
  
Here  
  
They come to snuff  
The rooster  
  
Young founders are a hot  
commodity in the Valley.  
  
Oh, ahem.  
  
You must basically  
have women on-demand now too.  
  
Ah.  
  
Yeah, we call that Boober.  
  
Okay, well,  
  
I think we should probably...  
  
- Yes.  
- ...move things along.  
  
Don't forget your bag.  
  
- All right.  
- Thank you.  
  
We're gonna be right this way.  
  
Thanks. That was fun.  
  
We've got to get our arms  
around this as soon as possible.  
  
Twelve murdered drivers  
in Brazil.  
  
The boardroom is an  
imperium besieged, all right?  
  
A board meeting  
is an end-times-style brawl.  
  
Katanas, battle axes,  
fucking ninja throwing stars.  
  
No weapon is off limits.  
  
You play for power, survival,  
  
And you stay for the barbaric  
gore of it all.  
  
One weak swing loses support  
of the others,  
  
And your blood paints  
the boardroom walls.  
  
That's a function of Brazil,  
not of Uber.  
  
How many taxi drivers  
died in that country?  
  
Probably a lot more than 12,  
right?  
  
No, you can't blame a country.  
The drivers are unsafe  
  
because the passengers  
don't have to have credit cards  
  
Or IDs to open those accounts.  
  
Yeah, but that's why  
we have passengers.  
  
And, by the way,  
exponential growth.  
  
It's the frictionless  
experience.  
  
You know.  
Think this through.  
  
One journalist writes about  
your drivers being murdered  
  
While you're talking to another  
one about getting laid.  
  
- I did not...  
- Close enough.  
  
Where does that lead?  
What other attacks may come?  
  
Now just for the hell of it,  
  
imagine that news crews are, uh,  
picking up protests  
  
Outside the Uber offices  
down in Rio.  
  
Just when we're about to get  
the elusive foothold in China,  
  
Xi Jinping, he sees it.  
  
Pulls the plug  
on the whole operation.  
  
Other countries follow suit,  
and before you know it,  
  
The whole fucking worldwide  
launches tank, Travis.  
  
And/or we do something  
to address the problem now  
  
And let the drivers know  
that we give a shit about them.  
  
Pretty amped up, huh?  
  
Well, it's not Gil's back porch,  
that's for sure.  
  
Is that some kind of Texas  
expression for bullshit?  
  
No.  
  
And no, Bill,  
  
It sure isn't.  
  
This is unfolding  
just like we thought it would  
  
when we were jamming on this  
with Crystal and Angie  
  
up in the hot tub in Truckee.  
  
We've got a big lead  
  
And we've got to protect it,  
right?  
  
- Hell, yeah.  
- Cheers.  
  
Hell, yeah.  
  
Hey.  
  
Remember this.  
  
Okay.  
  
No, no. No, I mean it.  
  
It's been you  
and your best friends  
  
Planning the future  
in the open air.  
  
Until now.  
  
Hold on to that.  
Remember it.  
  
Hell, savor this.  
  
That's the point of doing things  
with people you love.  
  
No, when we first met,  
you told me that you'd listen  
  
But you wouldn't be bound,  
so don't give me the love shit.  
  
They'll do what you say,  
  
But not out of fear  
or calculation.  
  
And you're gonna hear them  
the same way.  
  
But when this company  
becomes what I know it will...  
  
Board meetings are not gonna  
be like this anymore.  
  
I've been in plenty  
of boardrooms.  
  
You have never been in anything  
like what you're building here.  
  
When this thing  
becomes itself...  
  
Board meetings are gonna...  
  
Gonna be the Royal Rumble mixed  
with the World Series of Poker.  
  
Trust me.  
  
Sounds good.  
  
Hey, guys, get a beer.  
  
When that day comes...  
  
We on the same side  
of the battle?  
  
Well, if not, you and me will  
know we fucked up really good.  
  
Introduce you to the guys.  
  
- Bill!  
- Good to see you again.  
  
- Yeah, thank you.  
- Gil.  
  
- Hi, Gil.  
- What's going on  
  
I commissioned  
a driver survey.  
  
You talked to my drivers  
without me?  
  
That is squirrelly as fuck.  
  
Jesus.  
  
Yeah. Your drivers are unhappy.  
  
Without their bonuses  
and their incentives,  
  
They're struggling, Travis.  
  
What kind of schools  
do they have in their countries?  
  
This spelling and grammar,  
Jesus Christ.  
  
You know what? Spell and define  
"Manichaean," Graves,  
  
Or kindly take  
a listening posture.  
  
It means seeing the world  
in good or evil only.  
  
Which by the way,  
I kind of do.  
  
If you line up with me,  
you line up against me,  
  
I never forget that shit.  
  
It's not time  
for philosophizing.  
  
It's time for tipping.  
  
Ti...?  
  
That's your big solve  
for building driver trust?  
  
- Maybe it's a start.  
- No. Sorry.  
  
No, I don't think you guys  
are seeing  
  
The full theater of war here.  
  
In a couple years,  
drivers won't even be an issue.  
  
The future of Uber is one  
that moves beyond drivers.  
  
The future doesn't matter  
if we don't get there.  
  
Tipping is an extra 20%  
to the drivers' bottom line.  
  
It shows them that we stand  
behind them as a company.  
  
Let them know  
they can trust you.  
  
Like I do, Travis.  
  
Flip the perception.  
  
Tipping begins to get that done.  
  
And it's also just right.  
  
No.  
  
I'm sorry, no.  
  
I'm not even gonna go on  
the defensive for a second, man.  
  
When I walk in this room,  
it should be like Kirk Gibson  
  
Walking into Dodger Stadium.  
  
One loud long cheer that goes on  
the whole fucking game.  
  
We're doing millions of rides  
a day, dude.  
  
I am making you what your  
comic books of your generation  
  
Would call filthy rich.  
  
All right, all right.  
You want a standing ovation?  
  
Fine, I'll stand up and clap.  
  
But this isn't about my opinion.  
  
It's about trying to turn  
public opinion.  
  
You know, I...  
  
I don't mind kicking the drivers  
a few bucks each time.  
  
So why not make it a feature?  
  
After everything  
we just said about trust?  
  
Did that whole Manichaean  
comment just miss you, dude?  
  
Look, some people got murdered.  
That is a terrible thing.  
  
But let's not jump to asinine  
solutions like tipping and IDs  
  
that blow up our  
frictionless experience  
  
Just because that's our only  
idea right now.  
  
All right.  
  
All right.  
  
I move we put the question to a  
formal vote at the next meeting.  
  
Seconded.  
  
Hey, uh, let's talk  
Code Conference.  
  
Oh, yeah? There's someone  
you want me to dazzle?  
  
Investor? Journalist?  
  
I'm your prize show jumper,  
ready to leap.  
  
Just point me  
to the fucking fence.  
  
I know you can clear anything,  
  
but potential articles  
about you partying at a resort  
  
right after a murder.  
  
So why don't you just lay low,  
relax?  
  
David, it's Code Conference.  
  
It's Silicon Valley's elite  
in concentrated form.  
  
If I don't go, then  
my competitors fill the vacuum.  
  
That's not an option.  
  
I'll see you there.  
  
Fucking Gurley, man.  
  
We've got a more  
pressing situation.  
  
Go ahead, you want to yap, yap.  
  
Nine days  
since we sent the update  
  
To the App Store for approval.  
  
What? Nine days?  
No, that is way too long.  
  
The version that's up right now  
is fucking buggy.  
  
It crashes like half the time  
the user tries to update  
  
Their pickup locations,  
150,000 dropped trips a day.  
  
We're losing $4 million  
  
Every day this update  
doesn't come out.  
  
Maybe it's a glitch.  
Maybe Apple is just bogged down.  
  
There's a ton of new code  
in the build,  
  
Plus the new language functions.  
  
The App Store does not  
get bogged down.  
  
Eddy Cue doesn't allow that.  
  
Maybe...  
  
Maybe he knows  
the other thing.  
  
You buried it deep, right?  
  
- Right?  
- Yes.  
  
Yes, yes. He can't know.  
  
All right, then cool.  
  
I mean, I'm gonna  
see Eddy Cue at Code, right?  
  
I'll work him over.  
I'll say, like,  
  
he's not trying to hurt us,  
you know.  
  
He needs us.  
  
We're the number one app  
in the App Store, right?  
  
If Uber's all glitchy  
and we're losing users,  
  
it's not just us losing.  
  
Apple loses too, okay?  
  
I go to Code, I crush it.  
  
By the way,  
then the board sees  
  
they can't vote against me.  
  
Yeah, let me introduce you.  
  
Hey, I found her  
wandering around out front.  
  
New hire on your  
Site Reliability Section,  
  
So I know she's a rock star.  
  
I mean, I'm an engineer, not a...  
  
Leave her with me so I can give  
her the rock star treatment.  
  
I knew I hired on  
at the right place.  
  
Yeah. No doubt.  
See you around the water cooler.  
  
I remember your résumé.  
  
Double major from Penn  
in physics.  
  
And, wait, don't tell me,  
all right?  
  
I love a woman  
who does double Penn.  
  
Philosophy.  
  
I'm really excited  
to be working here.  
  
Feels like sailing  
over the moon.  
  
Poetic.  
  
Uh, where did you grow up?  
  
Where'd you go to high school?  
  
Homeschooled.  
Self-taught, really.  
  
In Arizona.  
  
You don't look homeschooled.  
  
I've been studying  
our platform,  
  
and I already have ideas  
on how to begin  
  
Standardizing some of our  
microservices.  
  
A self-starter.  
  
You'll do well here.  
  
Uh, just, um, pick any spot  
to work and dive right in.  
  
Okay.  
  
Habibti, I'm going  
to stay in the city tonight.  
  
Can't you come home?  
  
Got to get an early start.  
You know that.  
  
So wake up early.  
  
I'll get up with you,  
make strong coffee.  
  
I get more sleep this way.  
  
Where will you stay?  
  
With a driver friend.  
  
He has an extra bedroom.  
  
The money is worthless  
if I never see you.  
  
If the kids don't.  
  
Quality time in the dark  
isn't so great  
  
When I can't pay  
the electricity bill.  
  
I'll see you tomorrow.  
  
TK, Eddy Cue, nine o'clock.  
  
Going in hot.  
  
Now, whose plus-one are you?  
  
Oh, you're with the waitstaff?  
I'll take a dry gin martini.  
  
I can't say I'm exactly happy  
  
To see you here  
tonight though, huh?  
  
- Why is that, Travis?  
- 'Cause you should be  
  
In your office rubber-stamping  
our app update.  
  
Come on, your guys  
are killing me.  
  
Can you put a boot  
in someone's ass, get this done?  
  
Sure thing, TK.  
Anything for you.  
  
It's my raison d'être.  
  
And text me a list of what else  
you'd like me to do for you.  
  
I didn't mean it like that.  
  
I'm just saying,  
I got to get this done.  
  
My guys are all over me.  
  
Okay.  
  
Oh, look at this.  
  
Picture me and Sergey Brin  
in TechCrunch  
  
jamming over dinner.  
  
Think the board  
can shut their mouths  
  
About our public image problem,  
huh?  
  
- Sergey, it's such a pleasure.  
- It's so good to see you.  
  
I never thought  
I'd say this,  
  
But he is totally pulling off  
those Crocs.  
  
Sergey, it's a pleasure.  
  
Yeah, for him,  
the Crocs are a power move.  
  
Hi, partner.  
  
It's great to be  
breaking bread with you.  
  
Is this, uh, table four?  
  
I'm supposed  
to be at table four.  
  
- Hello. Hi, how are you?  
- Hi.  
  
Pleasure. I'm Sergey.  
  
Gabi.  
  
Our endgame is to build  
the TCP/IP for real life.  
  
Like, I want to be  
the packet switching  
  
For the physical world.  
  
Well, you'd first have to turn  
each shipment and passenger  
  
Into the same uniform size.  
  
That's what they said  
to the Wright brothers  
  
About fixed-wing  
air travel, right?  
  
That was a different problem  
entirely.  
  
No, I know that.  
I'm just saying it's...  
  
So, um, your mother  
is from Beijing, Gabi?  
  
Have you ever been?  
  
Uh, no, only once  
when I was a baby.  
  
But I've got relatives that  
I'm hoping to go and meet...  
  
Hold on, did you have research  
done on her or something?  
  
I bet you could give me a bio  
  
on, like,  
everybody in this room, huh?  
  
Oh, I was just asking  
  
Where she was from  
while you were ordering, man.  
  
So when you go, uh, you should  
take the Hutong Food Tour.  
  
They're these alleyways  
with different stalls.  
  
- Each stall has its... oh...  
- Sergey!  
  
Uh, each stall is another  
sort of exotic, uh, delicacy.  
  
I ate a snow leopard paw.  
  
The paw of a snow leopard.  
  
What they do is they take  
the leopard's paw and crack it.  
  
You think you know her,  
  
but that's just 'cause  
you know her name.  
  
Arianna Huffington.  
  
This is not somebody  
who says the first thing  
  
That pops into her cabeza,  
Daddy-o.  
  
If a chess grandmaster  
is always three steps ahead,  
  
this gal is on  
the moving sidewalk  
  
While you're still  
tying your shoestrings.  
  
She started a news  
and culture website  
  
where the writers  
didn't get paid  
  
fucking dick for their writing.  
  
And she went ahead and sold it  
for $300 million.  
  
And she was just getting  
her motor revving.  
  
- [waiter[ Sir.  
- Thank you.  
  
The notorious  
bad boy of tech.  
  
Were you offended  
by my Boober comment too?  
  
Because I'll tell you  
what I told my publicist,  
  
I'm not going  
on an apology tour.  
  
Offended? Darling,  
you're talking to someone  
  
Who's had to sit at meals with  
Bill Maher and Pat Buchanan.  
  
Listen to them talk.  
  
Find common ground.  
  
The people who would...  
Thank you.  
  
Who would take offense  
at you crowing a little bit  
  
Just don't understand.  
  
Every successful person  
I know  
  
Enjoys their success  
in their own way.  
  
Or they don't  
stay successful very long.  
  
And they certainly  
don't feel it.  
  
No, serving yourself  
is serving your company,  
  
Which is serving the world.  
  
I'm...  
  
I know who you are,  
Miss Huffington.  
  
- Arianna, please.  
- Arianna.  
  
And, yes, you are so right.  
  
This is what I was trying  
to tell my board.  
  
They didn't even want me  
to show up here.  
  
So many young founders  
burn out quickly.  
  
Here one year,  
gone the next.  
  
Because they stopped listening  
to their own voice.  
  
Or because they only  
listen to it.  
  
But you, Travis,  
  
when I look at you,  
  
I can see  
that you belong here.  
  
Damn straight I do.  
  
Uber isn't going  
anywhere, and neither am I.  
  
- Good.  
- You know what?  
  
You should give us  
a ride sometime.  
  
If you like it, tweet about us.  
And my contact's on there too.  
  
You are good.  
  
I'm seeing it all.  
  
I love it.  
  
If you think you see it all,  
give it another think.  
  
Tamara!  
  
I got you a drink.  
  
Why? I'm sober.  
  
Oh.  
  
Fucked that up. Sorry.  
  
No, I'll be able to resist,  
trust me.  
  
Okay.  
  
Well, more for me,  
I guess.  
  
Um, I think it's really cool  
that you got to come to Code.  
  
I'm really glad you're here.  
  
- Yeah, I know, right?  
- Yeah.  
  
It's nice to see all the hard  
work paying off, you know?  
  
Finally made it  
to the VIP dinner.  
  
Where you belong, for sure.  
  
Ohh.  
  
- To the VIP dinner.  
- Yeah! There you go.  
  
Well, I'll be at the hotel pool  
tonight if, uh, you should...  
  
Oh, I think... I'll see  
what Travis wants to do.  
  
Hey, I'm kind of tired.  
You ready to go?  
  
Yeah. Sure.  
  
It was so nice to meet you.  
  
And you, Gabi.  
  
Next time you could try being  
a little more professional.  
  
I was just being polite.  
  
You told me  
to impress him.  
  
Not by letting him think  
you wanted to fuck him.  
  
If I wanted to,  
I could be right now  
  
Rather than sitting here  
and taking this shit from you.  
  
I didn't say  
you really wanted to.  
  
I'm saying  
that's what he thought.  
  
You know, Travis,  
I have two moves in that spot.  
  
Walk away, stand in.  
  
I didn't want to make a scene  
and embarrass you.  
  
Well, you did both.  
It's okay.  
  
Tomorrow, I'll just go  
to the events by myself,  
  
because I need Sergey  
to like me.  
  
To focus on me, not you.  
  
Hey.  
  
Um, something happened  
last night.  
  
I was talking  
to Gil and, um...  
  
He, uh...  
  
What? Tell me.  
  
He touched me.  
  
What? That piece of shit.  
Are you okay?  
  
Yeah, I... I'm good.  
I just...  
  
I want to make sure  
it doesn't happen again.  
  
Okay.  
  
I need to know  
exactly what happened.  
  
I need to know how badly  
I'm gonna fuck this guy up.  
  
Uh, he...  
  
Could I get a Diet Coke  
with a lime?  
  
I will have what she's having,  
but put rum in mine.  
  
Hey, we should totally go  
for a walk on that beach pass.  
  
I mean, I stopped him,  
but yeah.  
  
Yeah, that never  
should have happened.  
  
- I really wish it hadn't.  
- Listen, don't worry.  
  
I'm gonna take care of you,  
okay? I got it.  
  
I'm gonna dismantle  
that motherfucker.  
  
Okay?  
  
Yeah.  
  
I swear to God, Jesus...  
  
Fucking asshole.  
  
It's fucked up.  
  
You good?  
You want anything?  
  
Not hungry? Okay.  
  
Bravo!  
  
Very cool, Sergey.  
  
The future is here.  
  
Yeah, we have a good  
feeling about this tech.  
  
Um, but yeah, I said that  
about Google Glass, so...  
  
I think top  
of everyone's mind  
  
is the incredible potential  
with this dev.  
  
Owning a car  
could become antiquated.  
  
The entire insurance industry  
could disappear.  
  
Uh, is Google  
considering starting  
  
a self-driving  
ride-hailing service?  
  
Well, the only thing  
I can say about that is, uh,  
  
Anything is possible.  
  
Hey, Drummond!  
  
So that whole "lay low" thing,  
that was bullshit, right?  
  
You didn't want me to come here  
so I wouldn't see that.  
  
So I'd just hear about it  
and then settle down  
  
Before you had  
to deal with me.  
  
The settling down part  
makes sense, TK. Do it.  
  
Yeah, I almost feel like it,  
because my own investors  
  
Are plotting  
to render Uber obsolete.  
  
- Plotting? Plotting? Sergey...  
- Sergey just got on stage,  
  
and he demonstrated  
the intention and the means  
  
Of my demise  
while smiling for the camera.  
  
Not the plan at all.  
Think about it, TK.  
  
We just invested 250 mil  
with you.  
  
Why would we throw a grenade  
and run right into it?  
  
I don't know,  
but that's what Sergey said.  
  
You heard him. Did he tell you  
to ask me not to come?  
  
Is he trying to get me  
out of the way, or is Larry?  
  
Larry and Sergey don't really  
know who you are, TK.  
  
I find that a little hard  
to believe.  
  
Sergey was trying to climb  
into my girlfriend  
  
Pretty good last night.  
  
Well, I think that was more  
about her than you,  
  
and proves my point,  
because let me tell you  
  
Who he wouldn't try  
to take a woman from.  
  
Zuck or Bezos.  
  
Smart you came looking for me.  
  
That presentation was a direct  
attack on you and your business.  
  
Right? But they won't cop to it.  
  
I just lost my cool  
with David Drummond.  
  
I couldn't let him stand there  
and lie to my face.  
  
But, I mean, he's our highest  
profile investor  
  
With a board seat.  
  
Here's what you do.  
  
Find a new investor  
with deep pockets,  
  
someone you can put  
on the board and count on,  
  
To dilute Google's influence.  
  
I mean, I have VCs knocking  
on my door every day.  
  
But if I'm gonna  
put someone on the board,  
  
I need to trust the fuck  
out of them.  
  
I don't trust anybody right now.  
  
Well, I would offer myself  
for the position,  
  
but there's a conflict.  
  
HuffPo covers Uber  
too closely.  
  
Second, you need your own  
self-driving tech.  
  
Being the best doesn't matter.  
Being first does.  
  
Whether you build it  
or buy it,  
  
You need to beat Google  
to the product.  
  
Levandowski.  
  
Kalanick.  
  
Now that we dispensed with  
fineries, talk, talking man.  
  
You're the one that should be  
talking up on that stage.  
  
Sergey was basking  
in the light of your work,  
  
But he didn't make this car go,  
you did.  
  
And yet they didn't  
make you head  
  
Of Google's self-driving unit.  
It's weird, right?  
  
Oh, you can't sow dissent  
where it's already growing wild.  
  
They won't let me do  
open road tests.  
  
Scared of the potential optics  
of a crash.  
  
So they promoted a Larry Page  
kiss-ass over me.  
  
You got to break  
some egg-shaped cars  
  
To make a fucking  
self-driving omelet, right?  
  
Exactly.  
  
But I'm the only one  
with the stones to say that.  
  
You're not the only one.  
I've always been my own boss.  
  
I hire geniuses.  
  
I let them say and do  
whatever the fuck they want.  
  
Geniuses like you.  
  
Imagine that.  
  
Running your own team.  
  
Calling your own shots.  
Isn't that what you want?  
  
That's what I want.  
  
Fuck these guys.  
  
Let's beat them.  
  
Oh, that's insane.  
  
Oh, I know, I know,  
they're giants, right?  
  
They are monster  
fucking aliens.  
  
And they think  
we're the goddamn Looney Tunes.  
  
But guess what?  
I'm Michael Jordan.  
  
And so are you.  
  
- How could we both...?  
- It's a cartoon.  
  
We make the rules.  
That's what I'm saying.  
  
Yeah. Okay.  
  
Taking on Google  
with their resources?  
  
It's too crazy.  
  
Too much risk.  
  
Fuck Larry Page.  
  
Fuck Sergey Brin.  
Fuck Google, man.  
  
Those guys?  
They're the establishment, man.  
  
We're the renegades.  
  
I take fear,  
I mix it up with some lams.  
  
I feed it to my dog  
for breakfast.  
  
Google's on your damn board,  
man.  
  
They're calling your shots  
  
no matter how big of a game  
you talk.  
  
Wrong. Nobody controls me.  
  
Especially my own board.  
  
And I made it so by stealing  
from Google's own playbook.  
  
I gave Uber a dual-class  
stock structure too.  
  
And me and my boy Garrett,  
  
We are the only ones  
with super-voting shares.  
  
I can block anything that any  
board member tries to do.  
  
And I can't be fired.  
  
You're a devious motherfucker.  
  
I'm a disruptor.  
  
Sometimes that means  
being a devious motherfucker.  
  
Sometimes it means  
being an obnoxious asshole.  
  
When you're ready,  
come by my office,  
  
Tap on the glass.  
  
"My girlfriend has no problem  
finding other partners."  
  
It's not as easy for me,  
since I'm always here.  
  
The whole  
"open relationship" thing  
  
Is working out better for her.  
  
I decided I got to look  
around here for someone.  
  
Then you walked in.  
  
L-O-L.  
  
Winky face.  
  
Mm, God.  
  
That's pretty pathetic.  
  
It really is.  
  
I feel kind of bad  
for the guy.  
  
I don't.  
  
It's so easy to just not  
say things like that  
  
- To your employees, you know.  
- I know.  
  
Just sounds like  
he's lonely, though.  
  
But that's not really an excuse.  
  
I mean, isn't there a protocol  
for these kinds of situations?  
  
You could put in  
a complaint.  
  
Craig will be notified.  
  
Technically  
it's anonymous,  
  
But he'll probably know  
that it came from you.  
  
That's my only option?  
  
Leadership loves Craig.  
  
He's a high performer.  
  
This is a first-time offense  
for him.  
  
I don't really see a need  
to ruin his life  
  
Over something so small.  
  
I don't feel comfortable  
working under him.  
  
We could switch you  
to a different team.  
  
But this is the star team.  
  
Because Craig is a star.  
  
You see?  
  
Motherfuck! The update's  
still not out?  
  
The board thinks  
it's coming out today.  
  
Gurley's gonna be  
sniffing around our shit  
  
Like some fuckin' TSA  
Belgian Malinois.  
  
What the hell's  
the holdup?  
  
Eddy Cue is friendly,  
right?  
  
Yeah, no, that guy  
fuckin' loves me,  
  
Which I do not feel  
from my own board.  
  
I feel... judged.  
  
The board is fuckin' legit  
  
Being judgy as hell  
right now.  
  
I want to add somebody else.  
  
Board won't add  
unless that person  
  
Can bring some serious dough.  
  
No, I know.  
  
Anybody I add's gonna  
buy the ride, don't worry.  
  
A huge fuck-you to Drummond.  
  
Exactly. Sequoia...  
  
I mean,  
they have the capital,  
  
But fuck them, I'm not  
giving them a second chance.  
  
Andreessen, they backed  
the other guys.  
  
Plus, him and Gurley,  
  
they're like Dom Toretto  
and Owen Shaw, so...  
  
Um... oh.  
  
What about David Bonderman  
at TPG?  
  
TPG?  
  
TPG is Google Ventures'  
biggest competitor.  
  
Oh, is it really?  
  
Google will take it  
as a declaration of war.  
  
Sergey started the war.  
I'm just gonna win it.  
  
Okay, well, to that end,  
  
I can get you TPG,  
  
But not Bonderman.  
  
He'll put a junior on. Doesn't  
take board seats anymore.  
  
No, it's gotta be him.  
  
True independent.  
  
I'm saying, I need somebody  
that cannot be  
  
Fucked with by my opponents.  
  
Then we should go back  
to let's find someone else.  
  
No.  
  
I'm gonna show you something.  
  
See this?  
  
That's Levandowski.  
  
I'm gonna poach him.  
He's warming to it.  
  
I'm gonna leave these fuckers  
with nothing on their plates.  
  
Strafing the enemy  
while they march, oblivious.  
  
Genius strategy.  
  
Yeah, but, also,  
once we do that,  
  
We have to take it  
the whole fuckin' way.  
  
Oh, yeah. Knife-gun-  
hospital-morgue.  
  
You know, you take from me,  
I take tenfold.  
  
They are bigger,  
stronger, richer.  
  
We can't forget that.  
  
What did... did  
David's best friend  
  
say this shit to David  
  
when he was  
loading the rock  
  
Into the fuckin' sling?  
  
Oh, you want a sling?  
  
I get you a fuckin' sling  
by 3:00.  
  
My job is to lay out  
the facts  
  
And have your back  
no matter what.  
  
You want to do this,  
we fuckin' do it.  
  
Yeah, I've been spoiling  
to fight these pricks  
  
Ever since they made us  
come begging to 'em for money.  
  
I'll get you that meeting  
with Bonderman.  
  
Then, well,  
it'll be up to you.  
  
Let's fuckin' go.  
  
Hey, I didn't bring it up,  
  
because I know you're dealing  
with a lot right now...  
  
but that interview...  
  
Uh, don't worry about that.  
  
It's a public persona thing.  
  
You know,  
Dean Martin drank milk,  
  
But he acted like a drunk.  
  
I mean,  
I wish you didn't have to do  
  
The posturing part.  
  
But I get it.  
  
And I know the real you.  
  
See, I wish I could have you  
on my fucking board.  
  
- Yeah?  
- Yeah.  
  
Oh, my God.  
  
They'd be so distracted by you,  
they wouldn't say shit to me.  
  
Can you imagine that?  
  
The best thing about Travis  
  
Is he'll run through walls  
to win.  
  
The worst thing about him is,  
he thinks everything's a wall.  
  
Have you lost faith in him?  
  
No. No.  
  
It's just that he's got  
unfettered power,  
  
which we helped give him,  
  
and he's spinning  
off course a bit.  
  
We just need to be his bumpers.  
  
Help keep this thing  
from heading toward the gutter.  
  
We redirect him in a small way.  
He sees that it's better.  
  
Then we can work with him.  
  
I get it,  
but Travis has more power  
  
Than any of us  
because of his super shares.  
  
Exactly.  
  
Our hope is to team up.  
  
We can't bully him.  
  
But if we sit back right now,  
we do nothing, might lose him.  
  
Might not be able  
to reach him again.  
  
Now is the moment  
for intervention.  
  
So on the tipping thing,  
we need your vote.  
  
Oh, I see that.  
  
I see that you do.  
  
Look, Travis threw a tantrum  
in front of me at Code.  
  
At me, really.  
  
I didn't like how he talked  
  
About my guys  
Larry and Sergey.  
  
That ego is getting in the way.  
It needs to be checked.  
  
I'm in.  
  
David fucking Bonderman.  
  
Bondo.  
  
Guy manages about a trillion  
  
Through the private  
equity shop, TPG.  
  
His investments sprinkle fairy  
dust throughout the Valley.  
  
Unparalleled brutality  
in the boardroom.  
  
This guy is  
the motherfucking ringer.  
  
Revenue. Growth projections.  
Some security measures.  
  
Do you want to go through  
any of that?  
  
I don't pick pepper  
out of fly shit.  
  
I know the numbers.  
  
You want my $90 million,  
  
You should know a board seat  
comes our way in exchange.  
  
Not our way. Comes to you.  
  
Oh, I don't do that anymore.  
  
I have a suite full  
of vice presidents to pick from.  
  
One of them will take the seat  
and get granular.  
  
No deal. It's got to be you.  
  
Not sure you know  
what you're asking.  
  
I have to put juniors  
  
In these board seats because of  
the scale of our operation.  
  
Downside is, a younger man  
might get swayed by a founder.  
  
I won't.  
  
No puppet strings attached.  
  
I call my own shots and cast  
my votes the way I see fit.  
  
That isn't exactly what some  
past operators were looking for.  
  
And they learned the hard way.  
  
Well, that is what  
I'm looking for.  
  
So if it's not your ass  
in the seat,  
  
$90 million or not,  
  
No deal.  
  
David.  
  
See you soon.  
  
Fuck yeah.  
  
- It's the entire list.  
- Oh, my God. Yeah, okay.  
  
- This is it.  
- Here he is.  
  
So Olivia Longociu  
just published  
  
Our entire list  
of data access permissions.  
  
- You goin' to the sandwich shop?  
- Yeah, let's do it.  
  
So I know for sure  
that Maia's fucking someone.  
  
That sucks.  
  
How'd you find out?  
  
For real?  
  
I looked at her GPS data  
through Heaven.  
  
She Ubered to a residential  
address on Saturday night,  
  
And didn't leave  
until Sunday morning.  
  
If you find a trail of gold,  
  
You can't be sad  
when it runs out.  
  
Just be glad you got some gold.  
  
- All of them?  
- Yes, all of them.  
  
Everyone who reads it will know  
that we access users' messages,  
  
cameras, contacts, GPS,  
  
even after the app's  
been closed.  
  
The comments on this article  
are animated.  
  
Animated? I mean,  
they're inflamed.  
  
Okay, okay, we're gonna  
handle this directly, all right?  
  
We're gonna put out a release,  
talk about the context  
  
Of all of our data access  
permissions.  
  
- Apple just rejected the update.  
- Shit. Did Cue see the article?  
  
Eddy, what's up, man?  
  
Travis, your build breaks  
dozens of App Store rules.  
  
It's an abomination.  
  
Okay, look, I'm sure we can  
figure this out.  
  
User privacy is the goddamned  
first tenet of Apple.  
  
You're following  
your customers home.  
  
We have very legitimate reasons  
for why we access the data.  
  
Change it, all of it,  
  
if you want to stay  
in the App Store.  
  
Otherwise, we will erase Uber.  
  
You got it, Eddy.  
I'll fix it.  
  
I've never heard of Eddy Cue  
calling a CEO directly.  
  
Yeah. Fuck, that's scary.  
  
Our entire business depends  
on staying in the App Store.  
  
This is bad, Travis. I mean,  
this really is apocalyptic bad.  
  
Am I surrounded by a bunch  
of doomsday preppers now?  
  
- Is that what's happening?  
- Wait, wait, wait.  
  
If Apple wanted to execute us,  
  
Tim Cook would have  
called himself.  
  
We're one of the biggest apps  
of all time.  
  
That is true.  
  
And they know we know that.  
  
It's a bluff.  
  
They're bluffing.  
  
Okay, but just because you know  
someone's bluffing,  
  
That doesn't mean it's your  
moment to make a stand.  
  
Change the app.  
We're gonna play by the rules.  
  
Do it now, fast.  
Thank you, everybody.  
  
Good read.  
  
Where'd you get that, uh,  
that bit about bluffing?  
  
Bill Gurley.  
  
Smart guy, right?  
  
Bill motherfucking Gurley.  
  
Will you get me  
a six-pack of Pacifico?  
  
What's up?  
  
- Olivia Lungociu.  
- Journalist at Madding Crowd  
  
just fucked us hard  
in her column.  
  
Open her up  
quick and quiet.  
  
She needs to be  
fucking neutralized.  
  
I'll see what I can find.  
  
The more personal,  
the better.  
  
Hey.  
  
Uh...  
  
Travis said that you were upset  
the other night in L.A.  
  
Yeah, uh...  
  
I'm sorry.  
Like, I was drunk.  
  
So...  
  
Um...  
  
But you went  
to our fucking boss?  
  
Like, I thought  
you had balls.  
  
I'm sorry, "balls"?  
  
You're employee  
number four.  
  
Plus, I thought you were...  
  
Down.  
  
For fuck's sake.  
  
Hey, TK.  
  
- Yeah?  
- That thing we, uh,  
  
Talked about,  
the, uh, Gil situation.  
  
Yeah.  
  
You handled it, right?  
  
Absolutely. Yeah, I told him  
to knock it off.  
  
And if he didn't, then I would  
punch his ticket out of here  
  
And out of the whole  
legal profession.  
  
That's it?  
  
What else?  
  
He's not gonna do it again.  
  
If he does,  
you just let me know.  
  
Maybe that doesn't mean so much  
  
Coming from the Boober guy.  
  
It's a persona.  
  
Why doesn't anybody  
understand this?  
  
Dean Martin drank milk.  
  
What? No, that was counter-spin.  
He had fucking liver failure.  
  
Okay, look, I already have  
a girlfriend and a mom  
  
And two publicists  
up my ass about this.  
  
Can you not also try  
to climb in right now?  
  
It's just kind of hard  
to do my job  
  
When I'm surrounded by creeps.  
  
Look, you hire the asshole  
every time,  
  
and then you let them do and say  
whatever the fuck they want,  
  
and you're not the one  
who has to pay the price.  
  
- I am.  
- What would you like me to do?  
  
Fire him?  
  
Look, if I fired  
every asshole in here,  
  
There'd be no one left.  
  
How about this?  
  
How about we focus on what these  
assholes are helping us build,  
  
And why it takes assholes  
to get it done.  
  
The point-five percent  
that you own,  
  
That's gonna be worth  
tens of millions of dollars.  
  
Yeah.  
  
How did your meeting go?  
  
You got private eyes  
following me?  
  
Oh, you know this town.  
  
Nothing stays a secret  
for too long.  
  
Or in this company,  
it seems.  
  
Anyway, uh,  
it was a bit unexpected.  
  
He was insistent that I'd be  
joining you fellas personally.  
  
That was a term.  
  
Well, that would be ideal.  
  
The board could use  
a little less spinnaker,  
  
A little more rudder.  
  
What'd you tell him?  
  
Same thing I'll be telling you.  
  
I'm no bandleader.  
  
No.  
  
And that's what  
we're counting on.  
  
You've always responded to good  
sense with good sense, David.  
  
And we would be  
expecting that to continue.  
  
You'd be joining  
at a crucial point.  
  
We need to keep this unicorn  
from running right off a cliff.  
  
I'm throwing 89 mil  
into this thing,  
  
And you're telling me  
that's a possibility?  
  
No, no, look,  
it's just a question  
  
of slowing the kid's roll  
a little bit,  
  
Helping him grow  
into the leader he almost is.  
  
Kid's cocky.  
  
He's, uh, flashy.  
  
He's brash.  
  
I think most of the greats  
have those characteristics.  
  
Or did, at one point.  
  
Agreed.  
  
Travis has all the qualities  
  
Of an exceptional  
founder-slash-CEO.  
  
But he thinks he's still  
killing giants.  
  
That's a good way to put it.  
  
Hell, you know  
how this goes, David.  
  
Just trying to rein the kid in,  
that's all.  
  
Shit.  
  
All right.  
  
I trust your take.  
How do we play it?  
  
We'll persuade Travis to add  
another board seat to your deal  
  
And appoint someone you trust.  
  
That'll get us  
most of the way to control.  
  
How's it going?  
  
You know what?  
  
Why don't you guys  
enjoy these?  
  
I have no use for them anymore.  
  
Let me get back to you, Rich.  
  
I know you're not happy with me  
  
And how I'm running  
my company.  
  
Well, it's nothing  
that we can't talk out.  
  
Yeah, that's what I thought  
at first.  
  
And I came here  
to make peace.  
  
But you know what?  
I have an offer instead.  
  
I'll buy back  
all of your shares,  
  
market value, $300 million,  
  
And you can walk away.  
  
That's not what I do.  
  
I build great companies.  
Companies that change the world.  
  
I don't take the money and run,  
Travis.  
  
I'm the guy that stays.  
  
So it's come to this?  
  
For Christ's sake,  
it doesn't have to.  
  
Listen, your drivers  
are miserable.  
  
And if you won't listen to me,  
why don't you listen to them?  
  
And if this trajectory  
continues,  
  
People will stop  
getting into Ubers.  
  
Aw, just like they're gonna stop  
shopping at Walmart  
  
And stop eating at McDonald's?  
  
Everyone knows  
those are shitheel companies.  
  
No one gives a solitary fuck,  
  
Because the merch is dirt cheap,  
and the fries taste delicious.  
  
We consume what we want,  
  
And our brains figure out a way  
to justify it later.  
  
And that's why the end  
of a drunk night out,  
  
or when you're running late  
for work,  
  
or just because  
it's fucking raining,  
  
people are gonna keep  
pulling out their phones  
  
And ordering an Uber without  
giving it a second thought.  
  
Relying on people's worst,  
  
most base instincts  
  
Is not a way  
to change the world.  
  
And the board  
agrees with me on that.  
  
The majority, anyway.  
  
Which is enough for me to get  
that vote tomorrow night...  
  
And every vote after that.  
  
I wouldn't rely on that.  
  
By the way, we both know why you  
don't want to walk away for 300,  
  
And it's not  
high-fucking-minded either.  
  
It's because you know  
that if you stay,  
  
Your piece is gonna be worth  
billions.  
  
Travis.  
  
They can't fire me,  
  
But they can sure as hell  
fuck with me.  
  
I need your advice.  
  
No.  
  
You can't hear my advice  
like this.  
  
We need to get you centered.  
  
Come.  
  
I'm not supposed  
to do this,  
  
But I'm going to give you  
a mantra.  
  
Close your eyes.  
  
Let mantra roll around  
in your brain.  
  
Let yourself go deeper.  
  
- Thank you.  
- Now, you're ready.  
  
Let's talk.  
  
Mm, see, there's a thing...  
  
Uh, darling, please sit.  
  
I can't have you choking.  
  
Sorry.  
  
Napkin.  
  
This is what I need  
on my board.  
  
I need someone who knows  
when I'm hungry  
  
And when I need to breathe,  
like you.  
  
You know what I mean?  
Everyone else, they're just...  
  
They're out for themselves.  
  
You added someone to the board,  
and he's gone rogue?  
  
Yes. Exactly.  
David Bonderman.  
  
Ah, big player.  
  
Strong ally.  
  
Difficult opponent.  
  
Exactly, right?  
So he's coming in with money.  
  
But he met  
with Drummond and Gurley  
  
Right after we pitched him.  
  
Then he sends me this email  
asking for another seat.  
  
Says his money  
is contingent on that.  
  
I thought he was just  
being aggressive,  
  
But now I know Gurley  
is trying to use him against me.  
  
I got to ditch the whole deal.  
  
- The deal isn't closed?  
- No.  
  
Not until tomorrow.  
I mean, the board votes on it.  
  
Don't ditch the deal.  
  
Leave Bonderman on.  
  
I have an idea.  
  
I'm taking the team out  
for drinks tonight.  
  
Come with us.  
  
I'll probably just go home.  
  
It's kind of more like  
a team meeting.  
  
You know, we'll probably  
talk upcoming projects.  
  
I wouldn't want to miss it  
if I were you.  
  
I could use a friend.  
  
Okay, that's an awkward thing  
to say, and we barely...  
  
- But, yeah, I could.  
- Of course.  
  
Yes, I-I get it. What's up?  
  
Something uncomfortable happened  
with my team leader  
  
On my first day.  
  
I reported it to HR,  
  
But she told me I either had  
to suck it up or switch teams.  
  
Switch teams.  
  
Shit.  
  
I love this work.  
  
Plus, then, like,  
I'm the one being punished  
  
For the shit he did.  
His misconduct.  
  
I feel for you, I do.  
  
And I...  
  
I fucking relate.  
  
The situation sucks.  
  
But you chose Uber,  
not the ACLU.  
  
And we basically signed up  
  
To work in the middle  
of Mardi Gras.  
  
We're not gonna show our tits  
for a bunch of beads,  
  
But, you know, there's nothing  
we can do to stop the parade.  
  
Oh.  
  
What if I were to tell you  
  
to not completely kill  
the old build,  
  
But to leave it working  
underneath the new build?  
  
And somehow, like,  
make it undetectable.  
  
You mean...  
  
How would you do it?  
  
Uh, I...  
  
I would set up a geofence  
around Apple HQ.  
  
So anyone looking at Uber's app  
from Cupertino  
  
Won't be able to see  
the privacy-violating code.  
  
Mm-hmm.  
  
It would look  
something like this.  
  
But outside the geofence?  
  
We're still collecting  
the user data.  
  
Wow. That's a fucking good idea.  
  
Do it.  
  
Do it quickly and alone.  
  
That is the build  
we're resubmitting to Eddy Cue.  
  
All right,  
couple of announcements  
  
Before we get  
to scheduled matters.  
  
Number one,  
I fully expect our build  
  
To be approved  
by the App Store today.  
  
We have made sure that there are  
no violations of policy,  
  
No intrusions of privacy.  
  
None.  
  
Privacy breaches  
have been removed.  
  
Not accessing cameras,  
locations or contacts.  
  
Good. As it should be.  
Approved.  
  
Excellent.  
  
Yep, just got the news.  
  
So if you want,  
you can check your phones.  
  
The build is live.  
It should be on there.  
  
Number two,  
I am directing resources  
  
Towards autonomous vehicles.  
  
And I believe I've aligned on a  
great engineer to head that up.  
  
I just sent Google  
my resignation letter.  
  
My 20 best techs  
are fucking leaving with me.  
  
Fuck, yes, dude.  
Okay...  
  
We wait for the right time,  
not too long.  
  
Then we acquire you.  
  
Larry and Sergey  
are gonna shit themselves.  
  
Larry and Sergey are gonna  
shit themselves.  
  
More on that later,  
  
but I think it'll go a long way  
  
To rendering our current  
tipping discussion irrelevant.  
  
Well, and we will have  
that discussion.  
  
Long way from ideating  
to driverless cars.  
  
To that end, uh...  
  
the first real order  
of business tonight  
  
is a vote on bringing in TPG  
as a Series C investor,  
  
which will also allow  
Mr. David Bonderman  
  
A seat on the board.  
  
TPG will also get  
a second board seat  
  
To be appointed  
by Travis and me.  
  
All in favor?  
  
Yeah.  
  
Welcome aboard, Bondo.  
  
David, might you be thinking  
about anyone in particular  
  
For that second seat?  
  
Oh, David and I,  
  
We've already decided  
on the second seat.  
  
Why don't you meet  
our newest board member.  
  
David!  
  
Lovely to see you again,  
Arianna.  
  
No one's smarter or more attuned  
to the moods of the populace  
  
At a given time.  
  
It's like she's psychic.  
  
Plus, this little girl  
right here  
  
Makes one mean  
Greek omelet.  
  
Hmm. I am thrilled  
by Uber's potential  
  
to make the world  
a better place,  
  
And to support Travis's vision  
in doing it.  
  
Thank you, Arianna.  
  
So now I have full confidence  
in this board's ability  
  
To decide what's best  
for Uber.  
  
Should we, uh, have that vote  
on tipping now, Billy?  
  
Withdrawn.  
  
House of Jealous Lovers  
  
You aren't just a boss,  
you are a motherfucking boss!  
  
You did it!  
  
Family business!  
  
Settled!  
  
Hey, yo, where's Gabi?  
  
Um...  
  
Fuck it.  
Let's just go out.  
  
Get some Ubers, let's go  
to a club of the adult variety.  
  
- Oh, Gold Club!  
- Gold Club!  
  
Tits on Travis!  
Tits on Travis!  
  
Tits on Travis! Tits on Travis!  
  
Tits on Travis! Tits on Travis!  
Tits on Travis!  
  
Tits on Travis!  
Tits on Travis!  
  
Tits on Travis! Tits on Travis!  
  
What the fuck?  
  
Yeah, you get fucked up.  
  
All right.  
  
We can make it.  
  
Ready?  
  
Yo, man.  
  
I know who you are.  
  
I'm me, man.  
  
Thanks for all you do,  
brother.  
  
Eddy? Eddy...  
  
This is a screenshot  
of their actual build.  
  
Tim, you're not  
gonna believe the shit  
  
Uber's trying to pull.
