| **Less is More**                           | **Example:** "The G minor Walts that I wrote at the end of 2023...there's nothing overly complex going on it's just a few core ideas that are highly memorable" **Quote:** "I only need ⭐️one or two really strong core ideas⭐️ and if I take the time to craft those ideas and make them really strong then I have the building blocks for the rest of my piece"                                                                                                                                                | Focus on 2-3 core theoretical contributions rather than cramming multiple ideas. Develop each argument thoroughly with rigorous evidence.                              | Aligns with my orbit approach - concentrate on key probabilistic reasoning mechanisms rather than surveying all entrepreneurial theories  |
| **Write Linearly (Tell a Story)**          | **Quote:** "stories have a narrative structure form and they're usually linear in some way they have a shape to them they have a story arc...let's think about our chord progressions as linear Parts instead of blocked chords that hop around from one chord to the next" **Result:** "so now each part goes on its own Journey tells its own story"                                                                                                                                                           | Structure arguments as interconnected linear progressions where each section builds logically on previous ones, not just isolated blocks of analysis                   | Mirror my theorize→produce→evaluate flow - each research component should have its own narrative arc that contributes to the larger story |
| **Harmonic Freshness over Predictability** | **Example:** "Breaking Bad or better call Sal...surprising left turns happened that you don't see coming but none of the characters ever does anything that you would consider out of character" **Quote:** "when I hear a chord that is harmonically fresh that ⭐️feels like it belongs there and yet I didn't see coming it's one of my favorite things to experience⭐️" **Method:** "establishing patterns establish ing consistency and then picking your moments when you break those so you have contrast" | Establish theoretical consistency within Bayesian/evolutionary frameworks, then introduce surprising insights that feel inevitable in retrospect rather than formulaic | Avoid predictable "entrepreneur as rational actor" cliches - find fresh angles within established probabilistic modeling traditions       |
| **Structure as Building Blocks**           | **Quote:** "composition is a puzzle it's a construction it's made up of smaller pieces that make up the hole...music is like a conversation we have sentences which make up paragraphs" **Example:** "Beethoven he took Sonata form and blurred the lines...he would do things like put a Fugue in the middle of the development section" **Framework:** "every piece has a model...every piece has a framework that it's based on and then expounds upon"                                                       | Design papers with modular components (theory, empirics, implications) that can stand alone but combine powerfully. Map out argument architecture before writing       | Reflects my computational approach - build papers like probabilistic programs with clear functions that compose into coherent wholes      |
| **Composition as Empirical Process**       | **Quote:** "composition is an empirical process trial and error it is a process it's not magic" **Method:** "he never just sat there waiting for inspiration to strike instead he just started to improvise and experiment" **Process:** "he would jot something down then cross through it then try a little variation on that and then cross through that as well" **Reality:** "it takes trial lots of errors and improvement with consistency in repetition so practice"                                     | Writing is iterative experimentation, not waiting for perfect insights. Draft, test ideas, revise based on feedback loops with advisors/peers                          | Mirrors Bayesian updating process central to my research - continuously refine arguments through evidence and peer review cycles          |
