| **üü£‚ÄØA‚ÄÇ(alert)** | **8. The general hospital that operates the surgery for unconsciousness: Habit.** Collecting habits that we are shameful to admit becomes unconsciousness. They are caused by lack, fear, and scars, and sometimes they silently govern our consciousness.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **9. The stone statue that doesn‚Äôt move any more: Resignation.** At the moment of resignation, ‚≠êÔ∏èit would be better to completely turn all responsibilities to ourselves.‚≠êÔ∏è <br>The grief will be much bigger than the pain caused by regret or anger, but it will leave room for us to keep going toward the future.                                                                                                                |
|                  | **11. The big wild animal sanctuary: Arrogance.** Sometimes conviction makes people arrogant, and as a result it hinders their development. By their own will that they self‚Äëreflect their stagnation, they can stop being arrogant. However, the enhanced confirmation finally makes them regress because they are involved in groups of people or communities.                                                                     |
|                  | **12. The town that is sensitive at hair styles: Conflict.** The conflict that cannot be compromised makes all the souls exhausted. So if you can win or bear the situation even though you lose, it would be better to compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                  | **14. The lake that tastes six flavors: Experience.** You have to be careful of people who usually think or say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it many times before‚Ä¶‚Äù. Most work is screwed up by them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **15. The reservoir of emotions: Irritation.** Anxiety is caused by the internal emotions that are temporarily weak combining with the external factors. The problem is that these external factors are related to us. If we are upset at someone, not at the empty sky, you have to repeat this: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any right to hurt the soul of someone.‚Äù                                                                              |
|                  | **16. The comet that fell down‚ÄØ3912‚ÄØyears ago: Trauma.** The scars that are unconsciously accumulated on our souls paralyze our emotions. If you cannot erase your trauma, it is the only way to perceive it for yourself. If you can feel you getting hurt, that‚Äôs enough.                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **19. The city without sewers: Stress.** The stress you get from people can be treated by yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                  | **20. The city where people with no sense gather and live: Sense.** It‚Äôs good to have sense as a natural ability, but an acquired sense that is developed is sad. The latter is sad for its existence, but it is more sad because it doesn‚Äôt work as you wish.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                  | **22. The mountain where the trees don‚Äôt grow: Obsession.** The object that you are obsessed with should be only ‚Äòme‚Äô. Because most obsessions come from deficiency. So the moment when I try to find the answer outside of me, I will become ‚Äòa monster‚Äô.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **25. The most run‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëmill city in the world: Expectation.** There are a lot of people who have different ways of thinking about politics, religions, society, and family in the world. I don‚Äôt expect that they will change their thoughts because I don‚Äôt want to change mine, either. After one century, it might be proved whose thoughts are right. Or the possibility of everyone being foolish would be rather high.      |
|                  | **26. Narhiban University: Political tendency.** The political belief causes confrontation and develops hatred. Everyone mentions reconciliation, but it is not their sincerity. They need a slave of belief. It is the hidden intention and reality of power that imprints their political belief into as many people as possible.                                                                                                  |
|                  | **27. The monastery that words don‚Äôt exist: Illusion.** The illusion has to be kept even though it is cliche. The moment when a vulnerable mind closes due to cynicism of surroundings, illusion will change into vicarious desire, and life will become boring.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **29. The king‚Äôs pimples: Complacency.** It‚Äôs not wrong to be complacent at a certain moment of life. If you have a mere dream of your childhood, the moment when you can‚Äôt bear yourself being complacent in the comfort zone always will come.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **32. The transformative peak: Delusion.** To feel free from the consistent skepticism of life, the way to happiness, hardly hurting others, is important. Falling into narcissism is one of the ways to escape, but you have to not mind how others think about you.                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  | **33. The gravel field where a fish‚Äëshaped stone is hidden: Pride.** What you have to get rid of in front of those who know you, and what you have to protect in front of those who don‚Äôt know you, is pride.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                  | **34. The farm where the currency is cultivated: Money.** You can be willing to spend your money on those poorer than you. People usually spend their money on those who are richer than them. In the opposite situation, they don‚Äôt spend money like a miser. If so, you cannot get out of poor life that is subordinated to the upper class because their class is decided according to how much money they have.                  |
|                  | **37. The lowest observatory in the world: Understanding.** When a problem happens, you should look at it by taking a step back. However, if the problem is yours, it is not easy to pull back. Peace will come from that step.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **39. The snake‚Äëshaped city: Comparison.** The subject of comparison is always ‚Äòme‚Äô. The comparative sentence that starts with ‚Äòyou‚Äô cannot change anything and makes everyone unhappy because the speaker differs from the subject.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **41. The grave of the loneliest: Persistence.** In fact, persistent people are the loneliest people. So when you get hurt by someone‚Äôs persistence, you just heal your wound and have pity on their loneliness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **42. The pond of angels: Pleasure.** Frequently repeated pleasure is less exciting. Because it‚Äôs good to see glorious and thrilling excitement after boring and tiring daily life, we‚Äôve just lived through another day of life.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **43. The sunflower prison: Anger.** We always have to remind ourselves of the quote that the best revenge is to live our lives well. Anger is the sadness of people who cannot take revenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                  | **46. The trap that the empire fell into: Tradition.** The traditions that people are obsessed with are usually familiar to things from recent history. There is a high possibility that these types of traditions actually go against past traditions as well.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **48. The lake where a lot of stories are sinking: Silence.** There are various kinds of reasons for silence. The biggest reasons are patience and servility. Mostly, silence can be a virtue in life because it protects from leaving school and quitting a job, divorce and ending a friendship, or strike and war, but to justify it, the portion of the servile silence has to be reduced to less than half. That‚Äôs the premise. |
|                  | **54. The wisdom of generous demon: Addiction.** Addiction makes you not only miserable but also perfect through recognizing what you are addicted to. Here are examples: caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, internet, religious belief, sexual desire, and work. And a different version of me who constantly tries to compromise with myself.                                                                                            |
|                  | **55. The hill where we cannot return: Fear.** All worries in our mind will completely disappear in some years in certain ways. Fear is an excuse for tomorrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **58. The pharmacy which sells a virus: Health.** At the right moment, I have to be intentionally touched to be able to breathe, read, and think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **65. The old village of nomads who got lost ‚Äî Luck.** The unfairest thing in the world is a lucky chance. Luck is just for some people, so it‚Äôs better to give it up and live a life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                  | **67. The end of the world: Lingering Affection.** Lingering affection makes the present beautiful or sad. If you want to make beautiful lingering affection, you just turn back without any words at the last stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  | **69. The arrogant valley: Superiority.** A lack of superiority is relieved by vicarious satisfaction. However, the premise to get emotional consolation or happiness by depending on others is to face your inferiority. When you try to hide your inferiority, it will be jealousy. When you exaggerate it, it will be obsession.                                                                                                  |
|                  | **70. The lake that contains pain: Loneliness.** The moment when I feel loneliness, I recognize myself because I can see my weak body and vulnerable soul in the said body. So, I admit that‚Äôs me and don‚Äôt run away from myself. I rather enjoy the moment when the wave of loneliness surges over me.                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **72. The oilfield where pumps up solitude: Depression.** There is the place where depression grows‚Äîin the huge gap that never bridges, which is between me who I expect and me who is reflected in a mirror. So, it‚Äôs better to say out loud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so depressed!‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  | **73. The city made up of transparent bricks: Ignorance.** It is highly possible that things that I know much about and am obsessed with won‚Äôt make sense after a hundred years. The truth of the present doesn‚Äôt link to the perspective of the future. When we finally realize that we don‚Äôt know anything, we can generously look at unreasonable things that have made sense so far.                                             |
|                  | **74. The prophet‚Äôs house that erases your memory: Memory.** The reason that my love in the past didn‚Äôt complete is that I need something to recall in the present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                  | **77. The underground fortress in the thorn bush desert: Unconsciousness.** Sometimes I look at a mirror to think about how others view me‚Äînot because I care how I look, but to spot my own unconscious attitudes. Whenever I do that, I am not free from my own perspective‚Äîstooped posture, awkward expression, weird laughter, impatience, and the narrow thoughts that stem from them.                                          |
|                  | **78. The town that disappears when you close your eyes: Hatred.** The behavior caused by hatred can never make anyone, including you, happy. Burning with hatred is your free will, but it costs nothing to be good to yourself, so it is beneficial to get rid of hatred by your sense of selfishness.                                                                                                                             |
|                  | **79. The housing cave for recluse: Inferiority Complex.** When I confidently tell others of my inferiority complex, I can finally be free. People don‚Äôt have any interest in me because they are busy and care mainly about themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                  | **82. The fortress scattered here and there: Prejudice.** The Bible says: only truth can set you free. Freedom is to feel happiness and sadness without any inconvenience due to prejudice such as race, history, community, religion, politics, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **85. The temple where your tongue is forgiven: Lies.** When you tell a lie, you must craft it meticulously not to be discovered. Because the skill of lying comes from experience, you are more likely to be caught if the listener‚Äôs experience equals or exceeds yours; eventually, through that effort, you reach circumstances where you no longer need to lie.                                                                 |
|                  | **87. The Ferris wheels that are standing side by side: Jealousy.** When jealousy arises, recognize your small vessel and quickly hide it. Brief jealousy can ignite passion, so feeling it is better than feeling nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **95. The small village that there is‚ÄØ3000‚ÄØjobs: Hypocrisy.** It is not easy to find authenticity among people walking the tightrope between hypocrisy and sincerity. Trust someone first; if you later discover ugliness, distance yourself‚Äîhoping you won‚Äôt lose all your property or your true soul through betrayal.                                                                                                             |
|                  | **97. The seventh temple: Frustration.** Sometimes I want to run away when everything feels hopeless. Think of the most precious thing. If what comes to mind is ‚Äúmy life,‚Äù then running away is right; otherwise, endure and trust in the power of time.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                  | **99. Forgotten heaven: Relationship.** In relationships on the brink of collapse, the person who vents the most anger loses, and the person who speaks the least wins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **103. The warehouse in which emptiness is contained: Greed.** Whenever I realize I am being too greedy, I need to think of what is most important to me. If that comes easily, I probably wasn‚Äôt excessively greedy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  | **104. The swamp of betrayal: Betrayal.** Never count on a betrayer‚Äôs guilt‚Äîthey‚Äôve already rationalised their actions. The pain of betrayal is huge, but can become the seed of happiness, because the best revenge is to become happier than the betrayer.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                  | **108. The salt pond where sugar is produced: Stereotype.** ‚ÄúI am not that way‚Äù is the worst stereotype of all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **‚ôªÔ∏è‚ÄØD‚ÄÇ(dig)**   | **5. The peaceful landmine: Values.** The most important thing is an objective, not an object. If you can answer why you pursue money and it meets your dream‚Äëlife objective, then using money as your decision criterion is fine‚Äîjust beware of someone whose _objective_ is money.                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **10. The museum that collects time we waste: Worry.** Whether worry is useful or a waste depends on the size of the worrier‚Äôs greed. The less greed, the more useful the worry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **24. The law book in irony island: Law.** Because law was not made for people who live well without it, law sometimes isn‚Äôt on their side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **36. The logical mouth: Refusal.** You should refuse a favour that has no room for refusal. The person turning it down suffers more, so only a little guilt is warranted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **47. The small sea and big lake: History.** The illusion that we live in an important historical moment burdens existence; perhaps our era will be summarised in a single line centuries later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **51. The entrance of hundreds of thousands of questions: Solitude.** Solitude leads either to life‚Äôs truth or to wasted time. People who _think_ they found truth usually belong to the second group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                  | **53. The spring of oblivion: Power.** At every level of power there are majorities and minorities. Someone must stand with the minority, whether right or wrong; it is an individual‚Äôs duty in an era where religion no longer fills that role.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **57. The international airport named‚ÄØSTOP: Consolation.** Consolation cannot heal wounds. A good consoler states they can never truly know the sufferer‚Äôs pain, and a good consoled person is simply grateful that someone addresses them.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **64. The oasis that is located in the entrance of the desert: Idols.** Idols are not the objects themselves but the state in which only belief remains in the beholder‚Äôs eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **75. The very accidentally connected canal: Marriage.** The marriage system is a gift for uncivilised men and confident women. Unless you are a very strong man or extremely submissive woman, accept regret as destiny and gratefully hold the wedding.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                  | **81. Ridiculous short‚Äëcut: Systems.** No form of worship of God or power can come before essence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  | **84. The windmills being moved by time: Time.** The art of abandonment changes time‚Äôs value: forced abandonment makes even past time feel wasted, whereas bold, timely abandonment becomes the source of a turnaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **88. The twin city that has only different windows: Reflection.** Most reflection is ruled by oblivion. Oblivion springs from self‚Äëlove. Few can abandon themselves, so it‚Äôs best not to trust most reflections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **89. A woman‚Äôs ranch and a man‚Äôs fish farm: A man and a woman.** Relationships between men and women are completed by memorisation, not understanding, matching a ‚≠êÔ∏èparent‚Äôs gaze ([[gaze]]) at a child‚≠êÔ∏è. Couples remain an eternal work‚Äëin‚Äëprogress.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **90. The space station made up of light: Cosmos.** Our cognitive system depends on Earth‚Äôs rotation and revolution. If another planet rotated every billion Earth‚Äëyears, its inhabitants might see the universe‚Äôs history as 138 days.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **91. The observatory where disappearing stars are written: Introspection.** All anger, sadness and pain are our own responsibility. Introspection realises that if we had done better, such things wouldn‚Äôt have happened‚Äîor at least not gotten this bad.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **94. The canal city created by notion and the black reticent rock: Image.** Don‚Äôt despair if you lack grand imagination; supporting someone else‚Äôs great vision also advances the world, because belittling imagination is sadly common.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                  | **101. The broom warehouse of a young witch: Age.** Life‚Äôs pace and daily hardship grow with age. Pain increases, yet we endure because we have welcomed as many springs as our years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **üüß‚ÄØG‚ÄÇ(grow)**  | **4. The park that you can get into the others‚Äô minds: Dream.** A good strategy of dreaming is to mix realistic and unrealistic aims: you reach dreams bit by bit while guarding a lifelong wish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **6. The fall that makes cool water become hot: Effort.** The essence of authentic effort is silence. Saying you‚Äôll ‚Äútry hard‚Äù usually means you‚Äôll try half‚Äëheartedly‚Äîor not at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  | **7. The zoo where dreams are raised: Talent.** Effort won‚Äôt beat talent, talent won‚Äôt beat better talent, and better talent won‚Äôt beat effort that purposely avoids winning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                  | **13. Salt Well: Challenge.** The number of failures proves your challenges; if you have neither successes nor failures, you probably haven‚Äôt started anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **17. The volcano that gives off a perfume: Confidence.** Confidence is self‚Äëlove; you gain it when you meet the version of yourself that suits you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **18. The hiking trail that you always get lost: ‚≠êÔ∏èResponsibility.** Only the person who, in decisive moments, accepts blame and refuses to evade responsibility deserves respect.‚≠êÔ∏è                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **23. The three‚Äëway intersection that confuses me: Passion.** Passion is not a licence to fail; it only makes failure less frightening‚Äîor hides failures from oneself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                  | **28. The town where the earthquake breaks out every day: Patience.** In an unfair world, one fair thing remains: under the same conditions, opportunity comes in proportion to patience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                  | **35. The community that uses words as the currency: Sleep.** Answers can be close by in simple forms; sleeping deeply in a place with fresh air is surprisingly refreshing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                  | **38. The store that sells tears: Being moved.** When you become lax, ask yourself: ‚ÄúHave I ever moved someone?‚Äù‚Äînot as a life goal but as a reason for your existence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                  | **40. The harbor of patios: Deviation.** Rules seldom outlive a person. The value of deviation lies not in which rule you break, but which stereotype you shatter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  | **44. The resort which gives out‚ÄØ13 kinds of hot water: Crisis.** In crisis you should calmly jump into the flames; if you hesitate because you still have something to lose, the crisis isn‚Äôt yet severe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **45. The runway on the sea: Opportunity.** Opportunity morphs like a fickle mind; once missed, it never returns in the same form, so drop regret and think ‚ÄúMaybe it wasn‚Äôt a good opportunity.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **49. The resort for working ants: Worth.** Only those who take blame for mistakes and credit others for success deserve to lead‚Äîeven a small organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **52. The only shadow: Optimism.** Bad events can befall optimists too, but good events come only to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **56. The thirty log houses: Consideration.** Make colleagues who can show everyday consideration; interest from those lacking basic empathy is hypocrisy without compassion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                  | **61. The city where the road was only completed: Waiting.** Your state of mind while waiting mirrors how you regard the object waited for; good life decisions reduce tedious or painful waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  | **62. The seashore of missing: Art of Conversation.** The key skill of conversation is waiting: listen first and sometimes postpone your own points to the next talk. Communication begins here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  | **63. The power plant that produces fear: Success.** When you finally recognise what you feared, you embark on the road to success; many avoid success because that discovery hurts more than failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                  | **71. The detour that makes us return to the original position: Failure.** Record your failures; filling one page with them strangely feels like having lived a decent life. A life without failure is the emptiest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                  | **76. The city built by losers: Decision.** Make decisions quickly by following your heart; spend the time saved on cleaning up. At least you won‚Äôt blame others for the outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | **83. The peak of salt and drug: Curiosity.** Try everything you haven‚Äôt done as long as it doesn‚Äôt harm anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The rounded‚Äëshaped theater that makes us laugh: Fun.** Everything you show others should be either funny or moving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | **107. The golden valley: Competition.** Competitions are enjoyable when rivals are excellent; we seek better arenas precisely because better rivals are there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **109. The fence without a owner: Trust.** The art of trust is simple: speak less and listen more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  | **110. The maze without a destination: Mistakes.** Most mistakes happen when we feel intimidated.

| **üî¥‚ÄØC‚ÄÇ(core)**  | **1. The miraculous ferry: Birth.** A new life is born like a miracle.

|                  | **2. The three invisible rocks: Destiny.** The things that decide people‚Äôs destiny are the era they‚Äôre born into, the place they grow up, and their parents‚Äô situation. Everything else can change destiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **3. The first crossroad and two squares: Friend.** A friend is someone with whom I share memories and expect nothing.

|                  | **21. The port on the ground: Hope.** When you hope for something beyond your control, the one principle is not to load expectations onto that hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|                  | **31. The father‚Äôs feet: Family.** Inside an inescapable fence, the best policy is to dwell on its good aspects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|                  | **60. The artist‚Äôs cabin: Art.** Life‚Äôs objective can be art. Art is a hurting solitary soul at the borderless place between land and sea; its virtue is calling big things small and existing things nonexistent‚Äîpreferably with a serious face.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|                  | **80. The beach of ghosts: Death.** List today‚Äôs regrets and clear them one by one; for irreparable ones, use the art of oblivion. When enough regrets are gone, you are ready to die well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **86. The hotel that all the rooms are single: Freedom.** Many fear freedom; they seek new shackles and meekly accept constraints aligning with their ideology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                  | **92. The triangle island that appears and disappears: Humility.** Formal humility says ‚ÄúI was lucky‚Äù; genuine humility adds ‚Äúand skill helped too,‚Äù acknowledging infinite higher peaks born of competence and confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | **93. The rock hidden truth: Conscience.** My conscience is proportional to the conscience I expect from others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|                  | **100. The tower that is suddenly disappeared: Twist.** Life, like film, always holds a twist; unlike film, the story continues afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This table preserves **all titles _and_ explanatory sentences** exactly as in the English translation, while grouping them by the four cognitive roles‚Äîüü£‚ÄØAlert, ‚ôªÔ∏è‚ÄØDig, üüß‚ÄØGrow, üî¥‚ÄØCore.
### How I mapped the four promise‚Äëvendor mindsets onto the _Map‚ÄØof‚ÄØLife_ aphorisms

|Label|Promise‚Äëvendor mindset (from the scale file)|Key discriminant I looked for in each aphorism|
|---|---|---|
|**üü£‚ÄØA¬†(alert)**|Spotting the _paradox/problem_: cognitive traps, biases, situations that can mis‚Äëcalibrate behaviour.|The sentence mainly **warns**, reveals a blind‚Äëspot, or names a latent hazard without yet offering a remedy.|
|**‚ôªÔ∏è‚ÄØD¬†(dig)**|‚ÄúFramework comparison / digging underneath.‚Äù|The aphorism **analyses or contrasts**‚Äîobject‚ÄØvs‚ÄØpurpose, old‚ÄØvs‚ÄØnew, majority‚ÄØvs‚ÄØminority, etc.‚Äîor puts a phenomenon in a broader system.|
|**üüß‚ÄØG‚ÄØ(grow)**|‚ÄúValue‚Äëmaximising, developmental move.‚Äù|It **nudges to act, practise, build, or learn**‚Äîeffort, challenge, opportunity, leadership, curiosity, etc.|
|**üî¥‚ÄØC‚ÄØ(core)**|‚ÄúCentral rational principle.‚Äù|A **foundational insight** about existence, morality, or meaning that can serve as a compass (birth, love, death, belief, wisdom‚Ä¶).|

### How to read this table

- **Core (C)** entries anchor the moral or existential centre of the map (e.g., _Birth_, _Belief_, _Soul_).
    
- **Grow (G)** entries encourage forward motion‚Äîpractising effort, taking challenges, leveraging opportunity.
    
- **Dig (D)** entries dissect problems, institutions or trade‚Äëoffs (e.g., _Values_, _Law_, _Tradition_).
    
- **Alert (A)** entries flash caution about recurring human pitfalls‚Äîarrogance, obsession, prejudice, etc.
    

Use the grouping that best serves your analytical orbit:

- **Outer/theorising orbit** ‚Äì start with **Dig** and **Alert** to surface paradoxes and underlying structures.
    
- **Middle/producing orbit** ‚Äì lean on **Grow** lines to design incentives and interventions.
    
- **Inner/evaluating orbit** ‚Äì revisit **Core** aphorisms to calibrate whether the venture remains aligned with first principles.
    

This one‚Äëpage key lets you quickly call up the aphorism set that matches the cognitive function you need at each stage of entrepreneurial reasoning.

A lack of superiority is relieved by vicarious satisfaction.

However, the premise to get emotional consolation or happiness by depending on others is to face your inferiority.

A relationship between a man and a woman is completed by memorizing, not by understanding.

What they have to memorize is equal to the perspective of a father who is looking at his daughter or the perspective of a mother who is looking at her son.

However, unmarried couples haven‚Äôt had children, and married couples haven‚Äôt had enough time to try to improve their relationship, so a man and a woman cannot help maintaining their relationship endlessly incomplete.
