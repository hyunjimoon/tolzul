## Section-Specific Rigor Enhancement Protocol

### 1. Introduction Formalism Enhancement

#### 1.1 Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Reimagined
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.70$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen formal framing of entrepreneurial decision-making as a sequential optimization problem
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  Entrepreneurial decision-making can be formalized as a sequential optimization problem with state space S, action space A, and transition function T(s,a,s'), where the entrepreneur seeks to maximize expected stakeholder acceptance under resource constraints.
  ```

#### 1.2 Context: Prioritizing Actions Under Interdependent Stakeholder odds against acceptance 
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.65$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Formalize notion of stakeholder interdependence through probabilistic conditioning
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  Stakeholder interdependence can be represented as conditional probability P(s_j=1|s_k=1) ≠ P(s_j=1), indicating that one stakeholder's acceptance state influences another's probability distribution.
  ```

#### 1.3 Literature Foundation: Fragments Without Integration
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.75$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Systematize literature classification according to theoretical dimensions
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  We characterize the existing literature along two axes: (1) odds against acceptance  representation (implicit vs. explicit) and (2) stakeholder modeling (univariate vs. multivariate), yielding a 2×2 typology of entrepreneurial decision frameworks.
  ```

#### 1.4 Gap: Missing Objective Function and Domain-Specific Limitations
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.60$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Formalize the gap as an absence of mathematical optimization structure
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The literature lacks a formal objective function f(a,p,c) that quantitatively relates actions (a), stakeholder probabilities (p), and resource constraints (c) in a unified optimization framework.
  ```

#### 1.5 Approach: STRAP Framework
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.70$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Explicit mathematical formulation of the STRAP framework
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  STRAP formalizes entrepreneurial decision-making as: 
  maximize_{a ∈ A} ∑_j w_j·f_j^1·Δp_j^1(a)/c_a
  subject to: ∑_j c_j·a_j ≤ R, p_j^1 ≥ μ_j ∀j
  ```

#### 1.6 Implications: Personalized Guidance and Ecosystem Benefits
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.65$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Formalize benefit mechanisms through causal pathways
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The framework generates theoretical benefits through three causal mechanisms: (1) information asymmetry reduction between stakeholders, (2) systematic variance reduction in decision quality, and (3) dynamic threshold adaptation.
  ```

### 2. Methods Formalism Enhancement

#### 2.1 Model Overview and Notation
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.80$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen formal notation system and variable definitions

  ```
  Let J = {supp, cust} denote the set of stakeholders, S_j = {0,1} denote the state space of stakeholder j, and S = ×_{j∈J} S_j denote the full state space. The venture state s=(s_supp,s_cust) ∈ S evolves according to transition probabilities T^a(s'|s).
  ```

- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen derivation of logistic model from rational choice theory
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The logistic form p_j^1(x) = exp(β_j^T x)/(1+exp(β_j^T x)) derives from a random utility model where stakeholder j chooses "accept" over "reject" if utility difference U_j^1(x) - U_j^0(x) + ε > 0, with ε following a logistic distribution.

- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The transition matrices T^(a) satisfy: (1) column stochasticity: ∑_to T^(a)_{to,from} = 1 ∀from, (2) upper triangularity: T^(a)_{to,from} = 0 if to < from (assuming state ordering (0,0)<(1,0)<(0,1)<(1,1)), and (3) absorbing state property: T^(a)_{(1,1),(1,1)} = 1.
  ```

#### 2.4 Action Selection Framework
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.80$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen derivation of selection rule from dynamic programming
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The action selection rule can be derived from the Bellman equation V(s) = max_a {R(s,a) + γ·∑_s' T^a(s'|s)·V(s')}, where R(s,a) = -c_a and the reward is the improvement in expected stakeholder value minus the action cost.
  ```

#### 2.5 Bottleneck Breaking Algorithm
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.75$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Formalize algorithmic properties including convergence guarantees

  ```
  The algorithm converges to the optimal policy π*(s) = argmax_a [∑_j w_j·Δp_j^1(s,a)/c_a] in O(|S|·|A|) iterations under the assumptions of: (1) finite state/action spaces, (2) positive costs, and (3) monotonic probability improvements.

  We formalize the sequence comparison through a Markov decision process where s_t+1 ~ P(·|s_t,a_t) and evaluate trajectories τ = (s_0,a_0,s_1,a_1,...) using expected cumulative cost J(τ) = ∑_t c(s_t,a_t).
  ```

#### 3.4 Performance Metrics
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.75$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen analytical relationships between metrics
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  Performance metrics are formally related through the equation M = f(p,c,t), where M is total economic performance, p is the vector of stakeholder acceptance probabilities, c is the cost vector, and t is the vector of implementation times.
  ```

### 4. Discussion Formalism Enhancement

#### 4.1 Entrepreneurial Operations Connection

  ```
  We establish a formal isomorphism between STRAP and classical operations management models by showing that the bottleneck identification problem corresponds to a stochastic flow optimization problem: max_{f_j} ∑_j f_j s.t. f_j ≤ cap_j ∀j, where cap_j represents stakeholder j's acceptance capacity.
  ```

- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  The exploration-exploitation trade-off in strategy can be formalized in STRAP as optimizing the weighted objective function: (1-λ)·E[p_j^1(a)] + λ·I(a), where I(a) represents the information value of action a and λ∈[0,1] balances exploitation vs. exploration.
  ```

#### 4.3 Real Options Framework Application
- **Current Rigor State**: $p_{\text{rigor}}^1 = 0.85$
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Strengthen mathematical connection to real options theory
- **Implementation Template**:
  ```
  STRAP's action selection rule can be reinterpreted as a real option valuation: V(a) = E[∑_j w_j·f_j^1·Δp_j^1(a)] - c_a, where Δp_j^1(a) represents the option value of improving stakeholder j's acceptance probability through action a.
  ```
