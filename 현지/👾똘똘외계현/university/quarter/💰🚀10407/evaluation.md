#evaluate 
1.  Irrespective of how you divided up the work in theory, how equitably and fairly did the work get done in reality inside your team?*

2.  How would you describe the contributions of your teammates in completing work?  Did everybody hit deadlines?  Follow through on issues as agreed?  did you have to cover for anyone--once, several times, a lot?*
fairly equal contribution with sang being the lead

3.  Did any internal friction or personality conflicts affect your team's effectiveness?  Describe.*
one member wanted to learn by saying but the spoken words were not very helpful for other members (at least for me) as the member didn't prepare for the meeting much.

4.  If you had undergraduates on your team (or if that describes you), were there notable challenges or surprises in how your team worked together?  
undergraduate assumed he'd be the busiest person... which is a bold assumption to make

5.  Any other issues, positive or negative, you would like to comment on regarding the dynamics on your team?  *
one who wishes to learn by hearing VS saying may have great conflict
