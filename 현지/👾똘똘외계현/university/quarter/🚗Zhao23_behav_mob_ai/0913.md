2. Write a counterpart story in transportation. • Identify one behavior related to transportation that you believe needs to be changed on the path of decarbonizing mobility. • Offer five different plausible theories that might contribute to that travel behavior. • For each explanation, offer a corresponding policy intervention.  
3. 

4. Choose one of the five theories and briefly describe a research design to test the theory, i.e., a research design that can prove or disapprove such a theory. Your write-up should be 3 pages in length (12 pt. font with single line spacing) and should include: 
• A meaningful and distinctive title 
• A 250-word abstract 
• A summary table, chart, or diagram that helps the reader visualize how your 5 explanations/theories might relate to each other and contribute to the travel behavior in question. Refer to Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Etheredge reading
