behavior and computational thinking;
- every organization (ac) exists to change someone's behavior (QQ. what's the difference between organization and someone - active+producer (policy makers and tool builder) vs passive+consumer (modeler and public))
- business decision -> behavior science

P2: data, algorithm, computing power -> representation (construct mental model), prediction (), explanation (travel, environmental, consumption behavior), control (broader - actuating, intervention), creation (ai impact notion of creativity) 

- one example of predict and control
- if we can predict vs if we cannot predict
- if today we can predict one person's travel behavior tomorrow perfectly, how may we offer service differently

- desirability (individual), feasibility (community)

order than deliver vs deliver than order
- amazon last mile 
- can we predict mobility in individual level? (travel time, origin, destination); do you want to go? if so what time?

subway and railway (600), 
when get in, get out, 

activity ranked by the duration of activity (prediction is on community level)
telecommunication and physical movement)
- policy plays a bigger role in transpo. to
- origin and destination is predicted independently  
- prediction accuracy spatial side is more granualar than time side (more regularity in space side than temporal side)

- • P2A: at the start of a day, predict when and where the ﬁrst trip will be, given that the user will make a trip within that day (i.e., result of P1A); P2B: based on the last trip observed, predict when and where the next trip will be, given that the user will make another trip within that day (i.e., result of P1B).
- what does (TFL: public vs private): travel information, marketing, travel demand management, pricing, journey planning

definition of efficiency and equity is different  (computation)
- importance of agile communication between private and public sector as it's forms a loop. frontier evolves based on the action of participating agents: eg of loop is gpt bans using lobby data, monopoly providing api ; leveling the prediction accuracy of different region (this is trade-off between efficiency and equity, but public sector can enhance efficiency by providing api so that wheels don't get reinvented)

by the way, ISO standard decomposes: (efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction (equity need distributional 
- observe non-user's behavior (fallacy in transportation policy)
knowledge))
- recommendation level (chatgpt); individualize communicaton

QQ. Frontier evolves, which evolves faster between equity (behavior) and efficiency (technological development + behavior from adoption)?

RO-based is much longer six month refresh schedule (longer~STR_STATE), RL-based is day to day operation (shorter, OP_STATE),  demand prediction? (database); analogy for transportation mode (pivot path?); how subway, commuter rail, shuttle bus, new mobility service are embedded?

QQ. dispatch rule for rule-based vs rl-based? (filter actions); hate

- long relationship of chief administration officer, 
- certain uncertainty that bus driver has but ai doesn't (local knowledge, common sense judgement)
- labor shortage and abstentism, we can't use just control, RL-engine for decision
- compliant rate (with ai guidance - 0 is recommneded adjustment relative to original schedule, add one min, move for; further - less compliant; aggressiveness of the recommended control actions)
