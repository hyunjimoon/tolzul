| **1. Research Question**    | • How does big data change the search for innovation?<br>• Does data-driven search crowd out or catalyze theory generation?                                                                                                                  |

# ADVISOR SYNTHESIS

## Scott Stern's Question
> **"Is strategic ambiguity a search strategy that eventually CONVERGES to understanding?"**

**Your Answer Must Show**:
- Vagueness is temporary exploration phase (like GWAS)
- Successful ventures resolve ambiguity over time
- Evidence: Specificity increases in later communications

## Charlie Fine's Question  
> **"Can you operationally SCALE while maintaining vagueness?"**

**Your Answer Must Show**:
- High vague + Low mechanism = Scaling failures
- High vague + High mechanism = Strategic success
- Evidence: Interaction term in regression

# REQUIRED NEW METRICS

## Mechanism Clarity Index

**Formula**:
```
Mechanism_Clarity = 0.4 × Causal_Language 
                  + 0.3 × Technical_Docs 
                  + 0.3 × Explainability
```

**Components**:
1. **Causal Language**: "because," "therefore," "enables" (density per 100 words)
2. **Technical Specificity**: Patents, whitepapers, architecture docs (count)
3. **Explainability**: "How it works" vs. "What it does" (ratio)

# NEW HYPOTHESES TO TEST

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Test |
|------------|-----------|------|
| **H_resolution** | Successful vague ventures increase specificity over time | Track vagueness scores across funding rounds |
| **H_debt** | High vague + Low mechanism → Higher failure rate | Interaction: Vague × Clarity → Exit/Failure |
| **H_scaling** | Only resolved ventures can scale | Clarity threshold for Series B+ success |
| **H_convergence** | Vague ventures that survive become specific | Time-series: Vague(t0) → Specific(t1) |

# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

## Step 1: Build Mechanism Clarity Metric
- [ ] Extract causal language from pitch decks
- [ ] Count technical documents (patents, whitepapers)
- [ ] Measure explainability (mechanism vs. feature descriptions)

## Step 2: Classify Ventures into Quadrants
- [ ] 2×2 matrix: Vagueness × Mechanism_Clarity
- [ ] Assign each venture to quadrant
- [ ] Validate classification with manual review sample

## Step 3: Test New Hypotheses
- [ ] H_E: Vagueness → Early funding (existing)
- [ ] H_L: Vagueness → Later success (existing)
- [ ] H_resolution: Vague × Clarity → Scaling (NEW)
- [ ] H_debt: (High vague + Low clarity) → Failure (NEW)

## Step 4: Temporal Dynamics Analysis
- [ ] Track vagueness changes over time
- [ ] Track mechanism clarity evolution
- [ ] Compare successful vs. failed ventures

## Step 5: Generate Production-Ready Outputs
- [ ] Table 1: Descriptive statistics by quadrant
- [ ] Table 2: Regression results (with interactions)
- [ ] Table 3: Temporal transition matrix
- [ ] Figure 1: Intellectual debt quadrants scatter
- [ ] Figure 2: Mechanism clarity evolution

# KEY EVIDENCE BASE (Direct Quotes)

| Theme | Quote | Implication |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Intellectual Debt** | "Not understanding why innovations work incurs intellectual debt, preventing anticipation of side effects or failures" | Vagueness without mechanism = debt |
| **Exploration** | "200% more likely to lead us to looking at places where nobody [looked before]" | Data-driven = broader search |
| **Quality** | "More frequently fall at both extremes... often defy expectations from prior knowledge" | Higher variance, not just worse |
| **Theory Generation** | "Rather than crowding out theory generation, GWAS findings are followed by a surge of research aimed at clarifying their causal mechanisms" | Complementarity, not substitution |
| **Complementarity** | "Deep complementarity... anyone telling you one is crowding out the other is doing a disservice to how knowledge [develops]" | Theory ↔ Data virtuous cycle |
