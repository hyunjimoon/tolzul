| **1. Research Question**    |     | • How does big data change the search for innovation?<br>• Does data-driven search crowd out or catalyze theory generation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Quality of Innovation**<br>• Higher variability in outcomes<br>• More extreme results (both high and low quality)<br><br>**C. Theory Generation**<br>• Surge of follow-up mechanistic studies<br>• Anomalies stimulate rather than substitute theorizing |

## 🍖 FLESHED-OUT FRAMEWORK (Full Analysis)

| **Component** | **Detailed Description** | **Evidence & Mechanisms** | **Strategic Implications** |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **1. Research Question** | **Primary**: How does big data change the search for innovation?<br><br>**Sub-questions**:<br>• Does data-driven search broaden exploration?<br>• What happens to quality distribution of findings?<br>• Does it crowd out or catalyze theory generation?<br>• What are the performance trade-offs vs. theory-driven approaches? | **Motivating Puzzle**:<br>Polycarnathus (2007) published TWO papers:<br>1. Theory-driven: Started from diabetes understanding → predicted INF-5 gene involvement (clear mechanism)<br>2. Data-driven: Mined genomic data → identified AA-0350 gene (novel, but no "why")<br><br>**Core Tension**:<br>"Can you just mine the data without theoretical understanding?" | **For your dissertation**:<br>• Strategic ambiguity = data-driven approach in entrepreneurship<br>• Vague promises = exploring without full mechanism<br>• H_E and H_L parallel: Early uncertainty → later clarity |
| **2. Conceptual Framework** | **Two Ideal Types**:<br><br>**Theory-Driven (Deductive/Galilean)**:<br>• Start from existing understanding<br>• Build hypothesis based on known mechanisms<br>• Test prediction<br>• Example: "We know how it works in glucose, so test INF-5"<br><br>**Data-Driven (Inductive/Baconian)**:<br>• Start from massive data collection<br>• Mine for signals/associations<br>• Identify patterns without mechanisms<br>• Example: "Data suggests AA-0350, but we don't know why" | **Key Theoretical Claims**:<br><br>1. **Unconstrained Exploration**:<br>Data-driven search less constrained by existing theory → broader landscape coverage<br><br>2. **Anomaly Generation**:<br>More empirical anomalies that defy prior expectations<br><br>3. **Theory Stimulation** (not crowding out):<br>Anomalies create puzzles → surge of causal/mechanistic follow-up research<br><br>4. **Intellectual Debt Warning** (Zittrain):<br>"Things that work without understanding mechanisms incur intellectual debt" → can't anticipate side effects or failure modes | **Scott Stern's Lens**:<br>• Is data-driven search a **temporary exploration phase** that converges to understanding?<br>• Or permanent state of "β̂ without theory"?<br><br>**Charlie Fine's Lens**:<br>• Can you scale innovations without understanding mechanisms?<br>• What are operational risks of findings without theory?<br><br>**Complementarity Thesis**:<br>Theory and data are "two sides of same coin" → virtuous cycles |
| **3. Data** | **Domain**: Human Genetics<br><br>**Data-Driven Method**: Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)<br>• Mines genomic data across entire genome<br>• Identifies gene-disease associations statistically<br>• Does NOT require prior theoretical understanding<br>• Example: Finds AA-0350 gene as novel target<br><br>**Theory-Driven Baseline**: Candidate Gene Studies<br>• Starts from biological theory<br>• Selects specific genes based on mechanistic hypotheses<br>• Tests pre-specified predictions<br>• Example: Tests INF-5 based on glucose metabolism theory | **Why Genetics is Ideal Case**:<br>1. **Clear ground truth**: Disease outcomes are measurable<br>2. **Strong theoretical base**: Biology provides mechanism theories<br>3. **Recent data revolution**: GWAS emerged as new paradigm<br>4. **High stakes**: Drug development depends on findings<br><br>**Data Structure**:<br>• Gene-disease association findings<br>• Publication data (papers introducing findings)<br>• Follow-up research (citations, mechanistic studies)<br>• Performance metrics (replication, clinical impact) | **Parallel to Your Work**:<br><br>**GWAS** = Ventures with vague promises<br>• Explore broad opportunity space<br>• Don't specify mechanisms upfront<br>• Pattern-match to success signals<br><br>**Candidate Gene** = Ventures with specific promises<br>• Target known markets with clear mechanisms<br>• Theory-driven value propositions<br>• Incremental/cumulative search |
