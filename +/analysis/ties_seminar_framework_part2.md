## 🍖 FLESHED-OUT FRAMEWORK (Continued)

| **Component** | **Detailed Description** | **Evidence & Mechanisms** | **Strategic Implications** |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **4. Research Design** | **Core Comparison**:<br>Compare characteristics and impact of gene-disease associations depending on the search process (GWAS vs. Candidate Gene) that introduced them<br><br>**Three Analytical Dimensions**:<br><br>**A. Exploration Analysis**<br>• Measure: Novelty of gene-disease combinations<br>• Hypothesis: GWAS introduces genes from wider genetic landscape<br>• Method: Compare genetic space coverage<br><br>**B. Quality/Performance Analysis**<br>• Measure: Scientific quality distribution of findings<br>• Hypothesis: GWAS shows higher variance (more extremes)<br>• Method: Assess false positive rates, replication success<br><br>**C. Follow-up Theory Generation Analysis**<br>• Measure: Post-publication mechanistic research<br>• Hypothesis: GWAS findings trigger MORE theory work (not less)<br>• Method: Track follow-up studies that investigate "why" | **Expected Patterns**:<br><br>1. **Exploration** (CONFIRMED):<br>"200% more likely to lead us to looking at places where nobody [looked before]"<br>• Theory-driven: "very cumulative, very incremental"<br>• Data-driven: Spans wider genetic landscape<br><br>2. **Quality** (MIXED):<br>• More variability in outcomes<br>• "Often defy expectations from prior knowledge"<br>• Higher commission/omission error trade-offs<br>• "Lots of responses but also many [false positives]"<br><br>3. **Theory Generation** (COMPLEMENTARITY):<br>"After one such data-driven finding is published, there's a surge of follow-up work... to illustrate the mechanisms"<br>• Anomalies → puzzles → theory development<br>• NOT crowding out, but CATALYZING theory | **Methodological Parallels for Your Paper**:<br><br>**Your H_E** (Early funding analysis):<br>Vague promises = lower early funding (α₁ < 0)<br>→ Like GWAS: Higher initial uncertainty/skepticism<br><br>**Your H_L** (Later success analysis):<br>Vague promises = higher later success (β₁ > 0)<br>→ Like GWAS: Broader exploration pays off long-term<br><br>**Your Missing Analysis** (Theory resolution):<br>Do vague ventures RESOLVE intellectual debt?<br>→ Track: Vague → Specific transition over time<br>→ Measure: Mechanism clarity in later communications<br><br>**Interaction Test Needed**:<br>`Vagueness × Mechanism_Clarity → Outcomes`<br>High vague + High mechanism = Strategic (✓)<br>High vague + Low mechanism = Debt (✗) |
| **5. Results** | **A. EXPLORATION**<br>• Data-driven approach increases exploration dramatically<br>• 200% more likely to explore novel genetic territory<br>• Theory-driven is "very cumulative, very incremental"<br>• GWAS introduces gene-disease combinations spanning wider portion of genetic landscape<br><br>**B. QUALITY OF INNOVATION**<br>• Higher variability in scientific quality<br>• "More frequently fall at both extremes" (high AND low quality)<br>• "Often defy expectations drawn from prior knowledge"<br>• Trade-off: More false positives BUT also more breakthrough discoveries<br>• Debate: "Whether it's even worth the cost mining the data in this theory-empty approach"<br><br>**C. THEORY GENERATION**<br>• "Rather than crowding out theory generation, GWAS findings are followed by a surge of research aimed at clarifying their causal mechanisms"<br>• Anomalies STIMULATE rather than SUBSTITUTE theorizing<br>• Virtuous cycle: Data → Anomalies → Theory → Better predictions<br>• "Deep complementarity" between theory and data<br>• "Anyone telling you that one is crowding out the other is doing a disservice to how knowledge [develops]" | **Interpretation Framework**:<br><br>**On Exploration**:<br>Data-driven = portfolio approach<br>• Cast wider net<br>• Accept more initial uncertainty<br>• Uncover hidden opportunities theory couldn't predict<br><br>**On Quality**:<br>"Ratio between omission and commission errors might be different"<br>• Theory-driven: Fewer false positives, but misses breakthroughs<br>• Data-driven: More noise, but captures novel signals<br>• Question: "How much is too much of one vs. the other?"<br><br>**On Theory**:<br>"You stop at the finding, or you use it to launch more theory investigation"<br>• Evidence: Scientists DON'T stop at data findings<br>• They pursue "why" questions triggered by anomalies<br>• Data doesn't replace understanding—it accelerates the need for it<br><br>**Market Failure Question** (from audience):<br>"Are we getting the right mixture?"<br>Speaker: "If anything, there's too much [theory-driven] investigation, leaving money on the table" | **For Your Dissertation**:<br><br>**Exploration Results** → Your H_E:<br>Vague ventures explore wider opportunity space (like GWAS)<br>But: Early funders penalize uncertainty → lower funding<br><br>**Quality Results** → Your H_L:<br>Higher variance in outcomes (some big wins, some failures)<br>Long-term: Vague ventures that survive show higher success<br>Because: They found non-obvious opportunities<br><br>**Theory Generation** → NEW SECTION YOU NEED:<br><br>**H_resolution (NEW)**:<br>Do successful vague ventures eventually RESOLVE intellectual debt?<br><br>**Testable**: Track ventures over time<br>• Measure 1: Promise specificity (vague → specific)<br>• Measure 2: Mechanism clarity (pattern → theory)<br>• Outcome: Scaling success conditional on resolution<br><br>**Advisor Synthesis**:<br>**Scott**: "Flexibility that CONVERGES to strategic clarity" ✓<br>**Charlie**: "Build repeatable systems AFTER exploration phase" ✓<br><br>**Key Insight**: Strategic ambiguity is TEMPORARY search strategy, not permanent state<br>→ Avoids intellectual debt<br>→ Enables scaling |

## CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR DISSERTATION

### Scott Stern Will Ask:
1. **"Is strategic ambiguity a search strategy that eventually converges to understanding (like GWAS → mechanistic studies)?"**
2. **"Or does it create intellectual debt where ventures succeed without knowing why?"**

**Your Answer Must Show**: 
- Vagueness is TEMPORARY exploration phase
- Successful ventures RESOLVE ambiguity over time
- Evidence: Track specificity increase in later communications

### Charlie Fine Will Ask:
1. **"Can you operationally scale while maintaining vagueness?"**
2. **"What are the failure modes of ventures that never resolve their mechanisms?"**

**Your Answer Must Show**:
- High vagueness + Low mechanism clarity → Scaling failures
- High vagueness + High mechanism clarity → Strategic exploration success
- Evidence: Interaction term in regression

## REQUIRED NEW ANALYSIS

### METRIC TO BUILD: Mechanism Clarity Index

**Components**:
1. **Causal Language Density**
   - Keywords: "because," "therefore," "enables," "causes," "results in"
   - Score: (# causal terms / total words) × 100

2. **Technical Specificity**
   - Patent filings (binary: yes/no)
   - Technical whitepapers (count)
   - Architecture diagrams (binary: yes/no)

3. **Explainability Focus**
   - "How it works" vs. "What it does" ratio
   - Mechanism descriptions vs. feature lists
   - Process explanations vs. outcome claims

**Formula**:
```
Mechanism_Clarity = 0.4 × Causal_Language + 0.3 × Technical_Docs + 0.3 × Explainability
```

                    Low Mechanism Clarity
```

**Predictions**:
- **Quadrant I** (Theory-Driven): High early funding, moderate later success
- **Quadrant II** (Strategic Exploration): Low early funding, HIGH later success
- **Quadrant III** (Intellectual Debt): Variable early funding, HIGH failure rate
- **Quadrant IV** (Incremental Search): Low early funding, low later success

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (전(轉) Phase)

### Step 1: Data Preparation
```python
# Read pitch deck texts
# Calculate existing vagueness scores
# NEW: Calculate mechanism clarity scores
```

### Step 2: Quadrant Classification
```python
# Create 2×2 matrix:
# Vagueness × Mechanism_Clarity
# Assign each venture to quadrant
```

### Step 3: Outcome Analysis
```python
# Test hypotheses:
H_E: Vagueness → Early funding (existing)
H_L: Vagueness → Later success (existing)
H_resolution: Vagueness × Clarity → Scaling
H_debt: (High vague + Low clarity) → Failure
```

### Step 4: Temporal Dynamics
```python
# Track ventures over time:
# Does vagueness DECREASE?
# Does mechanism clarity INCREASE?
# For successful ventures only?
```

### Step 5: Generate Tables & Figures
- **Table 1**: Descriptive statistics by quadrant
- **Table 2**: Regression results (with interaction terms)
- **Table 3**: Temporal transition matrix
- **Figure 1**: Intellectual debt quadrants (scatter plot)
- **Figure 2**: Mechanism clarity evolution over time

## KEY QUOTES FROM SEMINAR (Evidence Base)

| **Theme** | **Quote** | **Implication** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Intellectual Debt** | "Not understanding why innovations work incurs intellectual debt, preventing anticipation of side effects or failures (Zittrain, 2019)" | Vagueness without mechanism = debt |
| **Exploration** | "200% more likely to basically lead us to looking places where nobody [looked before]" | Data-driven = broader search |
| **Quality Trade-off** | "Lots of responses, but also many [false positives]" | Higher variance in outcomes |
| **Theory Generation** | "After one such data-driven finding is published, there's a surge of follow-up work... to illustrate the mechanisms" | Complementarity, not crowding out |
| **Complementarity** | "Deep complementarity... anyone telling you that one is crowding out the other is doing a disservice" | Theory ↔ Data virtuous cycle |
| **Market Failure** | "If anything, there's too much [theory-driven] investigation, leaving money on the table" | Under-investment in exploration |
