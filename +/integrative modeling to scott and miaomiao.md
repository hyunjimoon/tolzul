to m2 and scott
I really learn a lot by discovering fruitful differences and analyzing them. thanks for bearing me.

i'm reaching out to put two papers on your radar 📡

I'm aware [stat.berkeley.edu/\~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf) and agree choices are not usually explanatory variables, but there are two recent literature that aim to integrate them, one by susan athey and the other by vivek ferias
- susan athey's paper
	- "Combining the explanatory properties of quadrant 2 and the predictive properties of quadrant 3, integrative modelling (quadrant 4) refers to activities that attempt to predict as-yet unseen outcomes in terms of causal relationships."
- vivek's [paper](<[0910.0063](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0063)>)
	- "consideration set structure is in itself a signiﬁcant "explanatory factor" of choice heterogeneity in a given population"

⭐️after carefully analyzing josh tenenbaum's research trajectory, i predict resource-rationality will be where these literature from two fields (computational social science and operations management) would converge to. Resource rationality is the idea that human behavior and cognition can be viewed as rational under bounded constraints (e.g., under limited working memory), and under this framework i interpret utility becomes synthesized explanatory variable that abstracts feedback from environment, similar to "consideration set structure of given population" from vivek's paper. This means, action sequences can be expressed as dependent variable in a time series model with utility as explanatory variable. 

my short term takeaway is, "situation" includes causal components and empirical approach for entrepreneurship research should capture this to solve its extreme endogeneity issue. resource rationality on a level of individual and population's prior seems most promising to me.

Vague intuition!

vivek's paper on 
-  ‘automating’ the crucial task of choice model selection (which was a problem I raised in Moshe's class)
- 
- Assortment Optimization Under Consider-then-Choose Choice Models 
- "consideration set structure is in itself a signiﬁcant "explanatory factor" of choice heterogeneity in a given population"
- Explanatory power, Predictive power, Structural modeling

in sum, i predict resource rationality would be the key, action becomes a time series with autocorrelation, and this makes previous choices the explanatory variable for future choices. 

there's an emerging field called program synthesis (which katie collins who gave the talk on intuitive game theory is also working on) which casts statistic model with highest explanatory value as optimal solution given the situation. see more on mind is flat. 

to scott,
i and hart posen had different opinions on the legitimacy of bayesian entrepreneruship, especially the theoretical foundation for test two choose one. 

as i explicitly communicated with you, test two choose one is what i'm most focused on e.g. ([transcript/recording](https://otter.ai/u/sG9ETvWjSuCiTL3kexvGRUDWf1c?utm_source=copy_url) from last December where i learned measurement technology can change uncertainty from aleatoric to epistemic, benefits of alternating low and high bar experiments) , "test two choose one" is the one i've been focusing on. i feel consider then choose choice model can be one start for the ![[x/Images/scott t2c1_otter_ai.txt]]
