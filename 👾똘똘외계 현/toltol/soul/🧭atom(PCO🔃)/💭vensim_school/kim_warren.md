thanks oh thanks Fernando and uh thank you everybody for joining us today uh it's been Delight giving these uh seminars through the society and uh great to see so many people uh spending the time to show up and have a listen to what I've got to say which is always reassuring which is nice okay um so let me share the screen and see if that's all right can everyone see that and hear me yes EXC good okay uh right so this is as fandra says this is the last in the current series of these um webinars although we were just talking about uh maybe rounding the series off with another webinar where we actually uh um actually a short class to actually build a business model uh so that might that might be coming so what watch this space that may happen if we can get our act together or if I can anyway so uh who who's this seminar for uh those who've been watching these uh webinars before will will recognize that that they are aimed at two uh uh audience levels if you like uh for leader people people who are are vice presidents of marketing or sales or CEOs or chief product officers or whatever um they're they're not going to build models right uh they have people who do that for them um but they would find it useful to know how Dynamic models can help plan and manage marketing and sales strategies and initiatives I'll say a little bit more about what those are in just a moment and then for those people who do actually help them you know the analysts the marketing analysts in the marketing function or ex external Consultants who are trying to help that their clients with marketing strategies and initiatives um accountant in the in the business increasingly accountants are expected to do rather more than just count with dollars uh they're supposed to know how the business actually works uh and how marketing and sales works it's an important part of that so for people who are actually um typically these are folk who will typically be building spreadsheet models till they come out of their ears uh and and there's value for them as well because they'll see what these models can do and help them support those those leaders needs um again this is a an exhibit I've used before but it just brings out the the fact that that strategy is a lot more than just doing the annual business plan uh we've got functional strategies and plans we do big initiatives New Market entry product launches Acquisitions uh we may start new Ventures within a business I was talking to somebody the other day who's does quite a lot of that the business that she works for uh or or independent new Ventures just started by uh entrepreneurs um and then there'll be individual uh issues within the the a function and this in this case we're looking at individual issues within marketing and sales like you know why we losing customers and how do we get customers on board that kind of thing so all across that entire landscape we need uh Dynamic models that tell us how the real world is behaving and how we can make it behave more like we want it to that's basically what we're we're trying to achieve here um so here's the agenda I'm going to start with the basic principle about how customers Drive sales and how those customers have won and lost uh and then go on to uh to talk about the three Standard customer behaviors why do they start buying from us why do they keep buying from us and not leave and then while they're buying from us why do they buy more than they would otherwise have bought right those are the three behaviors that we want to to have uh customers do uh and that I'll explain something about how we model uh customers needs or or the benefits of the products and services or the values that the customers ascribe to a business or a product or service that they're that they're buying uh I'll then go on and and talk a little bit about ricey L I've put this into models I've done in the past for for clients but it never I never uh thought but actually what I ought to do is formalize this and explain exactly how I do that and and why it works and and why it's better than um the way economists think about PR C last I hope you'll agree with me when I I've laid out the case um I'll then go a little bit more into the into the customers being one part of the story uh and explain about the customer Pipeline and how marketing drives that and and the things you have to think about and balance and the costs and benefits of the marketing activities that pull customers into bit being active customers in our in our business I'll then explain that there are some uh there's just a couple of topics here that I I will only touch on briefly but you you need to be aware of one one of those is that uh durable products things that we only buy once or very rarely behave a little differently than consumable products so you know buying a swimming pool is a is a different kind of thing than buying bait beans right uh and the the way that the the the marketing and the customer numbers and the sales derive from the business structure is a little bit different uh and I'll also talk about the issue that in some cases you have to work work you have to do your marketing through intermediaries so if I'm selling baked beans the people who buy the baked beans are the consumers but I actually sell to retail stores right so I've got to deal with both of those if you like customer groups but only the retailers are actually my direct customers although I still have to deal with the the end consumers uh and I'll just mention a couple of topics at the end and and point you to some resources for for those so let's kick off with that thing on uh customers driving sales the basic thing we're trying to do here if we want to grow customers and sales but we want to do that profitably that's basically where where we're at there are some variations on that though even though that simple principle and that is that in some cases it's not customers that directly generate our Revenue if you're running a social media uh business um then uh your your subscribers may may very well be free you don't make any money off them at all uh but you make the money because of their activity generates um click-throughs to advertisers so it's the advertisers who actually pay you Revenue so uh that's a a quite different principle than the idea that customers Drive sales um and the the second variation on this is it's it's a very a very very Niche case but in true commodity markets where I don't know I'm a farmer and I make and I harvest some wheat and I send it off to Market I've no idea who the customer is I have no idea who's bought it it just goes into the market someone buys it and off it goes um that applies in some in many natural resource markets uh but it is very much an edge case uh in in almost every case we know who who's buying our products uh and and need to think about how to win them and retain them so here is a commonly useful structure for dealing with sales chall challenges so here we are here is a business of kind some kind whose sales last month were 5,000 uh units and this month they're 4,900 why are sales falling or not growing as much as we would like them to well it must either be because customer numbers are falling or growing too slowly or or it must be because they're buying less there aren't any other explanations uh for that and in this case the the explanation is that the customer numbers are falling so now we want to know why are customer numbers falling or not growing enough and there are two possible explanations for that either because the customer win rate is too slow or because uh customers are being lost uh too fast so in this case uh we're winning them at the rate of 10 per month but we're losing them at the rate of 20 per month um now that might look an unbelievably trivial structure but um we have cases where just showing that structure and putting the numbers on it uh for a client organization has has actually transform the way they think about what they're doing with their marketing um I don't have time to to to actually give give the uh talk through the slides for this but a pharmaceutical company that was having problems with falling sales of an over the C at drug was working uh they were working very effectively and they were frantically winning new customers at a hea rate U and the customers on average were were buying slightly more year on year on year the problem was that they were losing customers faster than they were winning them uh and they didn't know why and they weren't doing any marketing to do anything about that um it turned out that they could actually f fix that uh by repackaging the the product uh putting more emphasis into making the products um uh usage live longer with with the with the people buying it as the as the U as the consumers of the product aged um and actually spend less money on marketing so even that U unbelievably simple structure uh can get you started in in some cases um uh now for for anybody who knows about System Dynamics models this will look un unbelievably trivial and everybody should know this shouldn't they well yes they they it is and yes they should but believe me there are an awful lot of people out there who don't actually see the world this way um they think in terms of market share right uh so what can I do to increase my market share well market share is my sales divided by total sales it it's it's a it's a dependent variable not an independent variable I can do anything about these are the dependent VAR the independent variables I can act on um so I'm going to skip over this uh slide in the interest of time it is in the slide deck so anyone who's new to Dynamic models uh can go through this slide uh slowly a piece at a time and that will um help explain what these diagrams mean and how they work but I hope it'll be clear enough for the rest of the seminar anyway and we through that uh so here is a working model of what I just explained and it deals with how many customers we've got and what sales been making from a product over a period of time when the three things that I talked about are changing and in the blue case the uh rate at which we're winning new customers is falling the rate at which we're losing customers is rising so at some point um around about a third of the way uh through the period um the rate of which we're losing customers exceeds the rate of which we're winning them and the customer base starts to fall um now that gives us uh information on how many customers we've got on average each period uh and that multiply by how much they sell on average gives us our total sales in the pink case we turn around the customer acquisition and start winning customers faster again uh we managed to slow down the rate of which we're losing customers and we manag to stabilize the rate at which customers are buying this thing um so our total sales uh stabilizes and just a little bit begins to grow uh now you might be wondering why right in the middle of there I've got this thing called average customers each period and at the top right there I've got customers at the end of each period now um system Landings people will know all about this but not necessarily everybody else uh will appreciate it when we measure sales we measure sales for a period of time so let's let's take a year we man we we record at the end of the year how much sales we managed to achieve across the whole year so its units are uh sales per year so it's got the kind of per period thing on the end that's not how we measure customers we measure customers at the start of the year we measure customers at the end of the year now what that means is if you're going to calculate what our sales for the period are you got to know what the average number of customers was during the period and you do that by saying how many did I have at the start how many did I add and lose during the year so I I add half of those I take half of the the Lost number away and that gives me the average uh if I add the number that I won and take away the number I lost that tells me how many customers I've got the at the end of the year now if you just think about that for a second an awful lot can happen in a year so a year is a way too long period to uh build this or any other uh Dynamic model if you actually want to understand what's going on to your business um so uh typically monthly models are what we look at in more fast moving situations we need to look at weekly models even daily models uh but that's the the principle we've got customers at the start of of the period customers at the end of the period we've got an average number of customers During the period and that multiplied by their sales rate gives us total unit Sals so you can go and play with this model uh to your heart's content I put the the link here for that so we know what the three key behaviors are um become a customer uh do not stop being a customer please uh and buy more while you are a customer so what drives those three customer behaviors well um there'll be something to do with how appealing is the product or the service uh and by appealing we mean to what degree does it fulfill what customers want uh and that's not some kind of abstract concept that that's relative to what they would ideally like to have um and it's also relative to what our competitors offer so we do a pretty good job of producing some great breakfast serial that people like uh but actually you know some other breakfast cereal is a bit better and neither our breakfast cereal nor our competitor breakfast cereal is exactly what our customers want that's the principle here um then of course there's price um and that we think of that price relative to the products appeal so give given how appealing this product is how much would I'd be willing to pay for it so you know if I'm buying a BMW 5 series then its product appeal is massively high but if I had the money I would be prepared to pay a very high price for it uh if I were to uh go for a kind of bottom of the range scoda or some other um low low function uh uh motor vehicle then I would only be willing to pay a a much smaller price but the the thing about price is that our our response to it is very nonlinear and I'll come on to that when we talk about price elasticity uh a further point to make here is we have we seem to have an obsession with percentages for some reason you know our our price is 10% higher or 10% lower than our competitors um but when when a customer digging in their pocket they're thinking how many dollars am I going to get out of my pocket um in most cases we actually need to think about price in terms of the a absolute price in dollars that we're charging for this thing the absolute price that customers are willing to pay and the absolute price that our competitors are are charging um if you're interested in the percents by all means calculate them but they're not going to tell you anything very useful uh really they bottom line um lastly then there there's the oh and the balance between those two two things is what we call value for money um so if you think about the surveys we fill in or the uh review uh not the reviews that you see online or in magazines uh typically they will go through well think about car magazines you know they'll say you know how is it for Comfort how is it for Speed how is it for cost of ownership and so on so they'll rate them out of five for that uh and then they'll and then the last thing will be how do we rate it for value for money so given all of those things about how appealing the product is compared with the price is this good value for money or not and again is a kind of zero to five rating uh then the last issue is the marketing and sales and promotion activity that we do whether that's um TV advertising point of sale promotion uh online marketing direct marketing those those pesky emails you keep on getting telling you that you should buy something um but and as we'll come on to customers don't just not buy from us one day and then sry customers do not uh start out never having heard of us one day and then the following day decide to be loyal customers to us we we have to take them on a journey and we'll deal with that Journey a bit later in the seminar uh so if you if you um change the last term there from marketing and sales to promotion you can see we've got uh three PS there so if you just add the fourth P of position uh which is where can customers get this thing whether that's a physical place or or somewhere online that gives us the four Ps of marketing so we're we we're not doing anything kind of weird or or or different from what marketing people already think about what we're going to try and do is Express those things in a form you can actually really do some serious analysis and and work and decision making with um so uh there's the thing we we had a few uh minutes ago which is our stock of customers being won and lost and and buying at some rate and the total sales we get from that that so we need to think about how the product appeal how the price how the marketing and sales drives the rate at which we win customers if we have a more appealing product and those potential customers believe us then everything else being equal we would expect potential customers to buy from us more quickly uh similarly if it's more appealing um then customers who are already buying it are are more likely to keep buying it and not and not be lost so fast uh equally if we charge a higher price then potential customers may be less willing to start buying and if if we charge a higher price more of those customers who use it at the moment may stop buying it um and we have different marketing and sales things that we do to win customers in the first place or to keep them if they're already there um and we have uh those three things also drive that third behavior on the part of customers so why have I bothered repeating the same three things uh against each of those three behaviors well because in almost every well in every case I've worked on there is a different balance of those factors driving each Behavior Uh so to take a very simple example among the uh the issues that tell you how appealing you find a product to be might be the quality of service that you get for for the product so you bought something product I don't know a car or you know um some piece of technology from Amazon or whatever uh and something goes wrong or you need some support and you call up and the support is lousy um well you as a customer now know that the support is lousy so that will affect the rate at which you decide well shall I stop buying this shall I stop using this product you know next time I want to replace my car I won't buy a uh whatever it is because the the service is so lousy people who are not currently customers of that product don't know anything about that all they know is what they're told about it um and you know my experience might be very different and it might take some time for you know if this is an endemic problem with poor service quality it may take quite a long time for people who are not currently customers to to find out about that so uh similarly you know you might as a a new customer you may say well this is a bit expensive but actually I'm sure it will be worth it we've probably done this with things like um um TV streaming services hav't we we thought oh yeah at $25 a month isn't that much you know I'll I'll subscribe um and then you keep subscribing for a while and then you know six months later you think you know do I really want to spend $25 a month on this yeah there maybe maybe there's this other streaming service which is only $20 uh so the people who are thinking about becoming your customers think about those three things and react to those three things differently than people who are already your customers um and uh likewise they they take a different view of those things when they're considering how how often and how much to buy so we need a different balance of those factors driving each Behavior now let me just illustrate this with uh an example I I've worked up in some detail I've got a full working model of this case uh it's a company called beyond meat um which you may have heard of uh and their Founders um uh were very um uh enthusiastic should we say uh about the idea that lots more people would buy non-meat products if only those products were much more like the the meat products that they buy so I really really like steak why won't I eat vegetarian Alternatives because they're not very much like steak so who are they trying to appeal to they're trying to appeal to uh potential new vegetarians thinking people who are whether for ethical or climate change reasons or whatever are thinking you know I really ought to consider becoming a vegetarian um what are they serving them with well non-meat alternatives to standard meat products we're not talking about you know generic vegetarian foods here we're talking about things that really look and feel and and cook like and smell like and taste like the the meat products that they're intended to um uh replace so this is where those those benefits or customer needs or values uh get rated so what are the things that these Target customers might feel are important well we already decided that being very light meat is a is a thing that's important to them um they might even be prepared not to pay uh to to pay a little premium for this um they don't want the thing to be difficult to to cook um they would like a reasonable range of products you know sometimes I like burgers rather than steaks sometimes like to cook spaghetti Boles with with mints or whatever um they'd like it to be available right I don't want to have to drive 20 miles to to the store to get this thing uh and a last factor for them is do other people like me uh buy this this is a a a thing that quite often comes up in consumer product cases um people do like to be seen to be uh buying or uses or consuming things that other people like themselves uh are are buying or using so what do we do with this well we ask our Target customer segment how important to them is each of those values um I put it on a zero to 10 scale in in order to turn it into a working model you basically need to to rate these things on a zero to one uh scale uh obviously uh 0 to five liquid scales are are more common uh however you do it this is what you do and our view is that uh being very like meat is kind of nine out of 10 importance to these people um being easy to cook is quite important and being for people like me is kind of seven out of 10 important um other issues are less important so um beyond meat uh ink they actually went went public in who when was it was it 2017 I think or maybe a bit later than that uh anyway they are a publicly quoted company now uh and they Chuck huge amounts of R&D into making very meat-like products uh not especially low price relatively easy to cook with an okay range of availability and seen for people like me and all of their advertising kind of says those two things it says this is very like me and other people like you uh buy this thing so um if they did their consumer research um today and said okay what do you think about these products compared with what you would want from these products they would claim to have a really very good fit um now what do we do with that well that that we how well those those um ratings fit with what consumers me uh need drives in in a different balance uh each of those three behaviors and that's what we actually put into the model um we've done this with consumer drinks Brands uh we've done it with uh Services uh it's a standard structure uh it's pretty reliable you've just got to be very very careful about what you put on that survey on the left hand side I'll say a bit more about uh I'll illustrate why that's important in in just a moment um the the the third thing you do uh is rate uh what what competitors offer so you can put in your advertising you know our our stuff is much more like meat than the stuff that you can get from uh Walmart's own brand uh pseudo meat products so the the main competitors here are are going to be um uh supermarkets own Brands and some other existing um consumer product producers uh so they would carry out a survey and they say oh yeah we're much better than they are in terms of it being very likely uh and down to the bottom there it would be well nobody is going to be seen dead um uh at cooking on their barbecue for their friends uh something that's a supermarket home brand they definitely want to be seen cooking the best thing here which is the Beyond me Product um so that little text at the top i' I've revealed there kind of summarizes what what Beyond beat believes about their product now what does that do for us well it does those three things it helps us win customers consumers it helps us keep consumers uh and it it raises the frequency with which those consumers buy the thing and all of that means that we can go to the big Su uh big retailers like McDonald's and Walmart and uh Tesco and people like that and say Hey you know the consumers really rate this thing why why don't you stock it so that they can actually buy it um unfortunately that hasn't gone too well um McDonald's did a big trial uh of beyond meat products and uh decided it didn't work too well um so they what Beyond me company failed then to drive the strong sales growth that they needed at at good prices now what this means is that we've got to think about something else which is where do those consumers come from right they must be out there in the big wide world somewhere and uh Beyond meat's view is that there is a a big tank out there full of millions of potential consumers who would buy non-meat food products If Only They were exactly like me um and if that were the case then they would be able to follow the green line which is you know pump those people out of the potential consumers box on the left and into the um uh the active beyond meat consumers box uh on the right uh unfortunately um it turns out that being exactly like meat is not a product characteristic that is is important enough to enough consumers uh to to to make this system work um so if you walk into a supermarket you know millions and millions of people are pulling veget non-meat food products off the shelves all the time without asking themselves is this exactly night meat or not do I care no I don't think I do is it nice in its own terms yes it is then I'll buy it right uh now what that means is is that we can never win consumers fast enough which means that we can never grow the the sales um that that oh uh that I do apologize that chart is wrong that chart on the bottom right there is wrong I will fix it uh what it should show is a rising rate of sales uh peing at a at a high rate in the green case uh and a rising rate of sales uh peing at a low rate in the purple case I do apologize for that I have to fix that um now what this means if we take a general lesson from this what it means is we've always got to estimate what the potential customer base for our product or service actually is and ask ourselves if that could limit the customer win rate so uh for for people who build models the the formula in here that says how fast are we winning customers must include something that says how many remaining potential customers are there out there because if that number is small then that rate is going to be slow uh okay so that there's a I think we've beaten this thing to death now haven't we uh that thing about what drives the three customer behaviors and the and the value curve thing so let's move on to this issue of price elasticity um Fernando I'm not actually keeping an eye on the chat while I'm doing this uh I do hope I'm not missing important questions yeah I and keeping an eye here I actually encourage people to send questions to to the chat we are okaying them later cool all right um I I'm reluctant to pause for questions as we go because it's a very full agenda this afternoon so I'll pile on if that's okay uh but don't but don't let me get away with not answering your question at the end okay um so uh let's move on to the price elasticity thing um I I guess we've all had economics 101 haven't we at at business school or university somewhere uh and economists have this slightly strange thing called a price elasticity curve where um the uh the price is is higher at lower quantities and lower at higher quantities I don't imagine I can't really understand why they put the the AIS that way around but they do I would have thought price would be the the independent variable that we as management decide and the uh dependent variable we're interested in is how much will we sell if we set that price but there we go I'm sure economists have got some explanation for that um what's really going on well the the clearly price is going to affect each of those three same behaviors but it's going to do so in a highly nonlinear way um so if we think about how fast customers are won uh that that chart at the top left there is is not a time chart it it says given the price I set how fast can I expect to win customers given the product appeal and the marketing I'm doing right um and at a very low price there is some high rate at which I might win customers uh but it doesn't keep on going up to Infinity because there is some limit to how many people might ever want the product so it it doesn't kind of go off in that asymptotic uh way um then then you move across as the price uh uh in increases the number of customers who are prepared to pay that price Falls and there is a a threshold Beyond which they say well this is just you know unacceptable it's way too high at price um and and the customer win rate falls off a cliff to a very low rate uh at at higher prices uh similarly on the loss uh side uh existing customers um if the price is low um that you know very few of those customers will be lost you know they might uh they might be lost if they um grow out of the product for example you know I'm not going to buy kids shoes anymore when my kids have grown up um so there'll be some nonzero loss rate uh at at whatever low price uh we set um and then as we raise the price there'll be a nonlinear relationship which says oh wow this is getting really expensive I I think I'm going to stop buying this thing now um and uh that that loss rate may terminate at some high high rate it could be kind of nearly if you're stupid about price it could be you 100% you really do something silly with the price uh people will stop buying it alt together instantly um as I say these are not time charts their lookup relationships so given the price what is the rate at which we can expect to win customers and lose customers for any level of product appeal and uh marketing effort and then the same applies uh with the purchase rate so if we think about this in uh back to our friends at Beyond me it is quite expensive all right it's a you know someone's got to pay for all that possy R&D they have to to do to make uh these products exactly like me so on the supermarket shelf the product looks a bit more expensive than the supermarket own brand so uh even if someone says yes to the first question shall I start buying the thing uh and says no to the second question yes I will keep buying it they'll still say to themselves well this is quite expensive so I will buy it occasionally but just for a treat right so um at at higher prices the purchase rate goes down uh and that's how you end up with the uh with driving whatever total serves are so um uh you can tell me afterwards and throw tomatoes at me or something I I I think this is a much much more realistic way of understanding what uh price does to um customer numbers and sales uh and again there's a a model you can go and play with uh to try this out for yourself uh with a number of customers for something um there's a price that you can set uh on the left hand side and I've got two scenarios here in the first scenario I start at a price of uh 50 cents and I keep on raising the price until it's $170 uh and you can see that what the lookup function does is it says well your your customer win rate is actually going to fall um to almost nothing um your customer loss rate is going to uh rise substantially um why does it come down well it comes down at the end because there aren't any customers Left to Lose the the percentage customer loss rate does keep climbing up to you know more than 50% a month or something but the actual ual numbers of customers lost uh Falls away because we haven't got anyone left left left to lose and then um uh the average customer purchase rate in the blue scenario also falls to almost nothing so our total sales Fall to almost nothing and if we multiply sales by price then our total sales revenue Falls to almost nothing uh what happens in the uh scenario where we cap the price at 90 cents uh so you know some clever marketing person has kind of been looking at this this scenario playing out and says this isn't a very good idea let let's stop raising the price I I spent a few years working in the beer industry and for some reason every year we thought we could keep on putting up the price um and uh it it always seems to be the case that if we put the price up yes we'd lose a little bit but we never lost enough uh to make up for the loss margin for the price increase we push through uh us and all our competitors by the way it's why you might think that beer is more expensive than it really ought to be so um in the up up at the left there in the green scenario the uh new customer uh win rate stops falling so we continue to to pile on and uh cap capture customers at a decent rate on the right hand side our customer loss rate plateaus and um uh doesn't rise anymore uh notice that the scale on those two charts Is Not the Same by the way so um I think we are uh in the green scenario we end up losing customers just a little faster than than we're winning them but but not by much and the average customer purchase rate stops falling so our total sales um continue to fall very slowly and our sales revenue continues to to uh but in in the blue case the high price loses a bigger fraction of uh customers um and here's an interesting thing we we've stopped changing the price in the middle uh in about a third of the way through the scenario we stopped changing the price at 90 cents but sales continued to change uh and if I carried on this on for forever uh they would Plateau at at some rate um and I think that that says we also know exactly how short run and long run price elasticity work uh so we take a a case let's say there's a big jump jump this is a situation we all we're all familiar with big increase in petrol prices what do we do yeah know we all immediately uh cut back on uh how much driving we do or we uh we are a bit more life footed on the accelerator uh and um therefore start buying a bit less a bit less fuel If It Go goes on a while though when we come to replace our car we think oh hang on um I think i' I think I'd better go for a car that's uh more fuel efficient so in the short run we see a step downward change in petrol sales by a small amount and then over the coming two three five years if petrol prices continue to be high then the the fleet of vehicles on the road gets replaced by more fuel efficient vehicles um and sales continue to fall at a slow rate so we've got both short run and long run pricey laicity in this model uh and you know the marketing person in this case realized that there is a sweet spot for what price they should charge and it's somewhere a bit less than 90 cents a unit um the customer pipeline customers do not as I say uh move from a state where they've never heard of you um yesterday to start buying from you tomorrow uh we have to take them through a journey uh and the marketing uh fraternity uh know all about this they have something called the Ador model which says that you have to move people through being aware of a product being interested in it being uh actually wanting it uh and then acting on it and and deciding to buy it um and they've moved on from there and they come up with something more sophisticated the idea of a customer funnel that you kind of pour customers in at the top uh by making them aware of it and then they they gradually filter down until finally at the bottom you've got um people who have converted to being customers and are loyal to it and if you're really good at it they they will Advocate it and uh tell all their friends uh uh and uh you'll get that word of mouth increasing the awareness problem is if we're going to get rigorous about this that funnel is a it's just a bad analogy it is not a good representation of how the world works first of all in a funnel everything that goes in at the top comes out of the bottom it can may come out of the bottom quite slowly but it comes out everything comes out at the bottom there is no mechanism in a funnel for people to go back up from one one state to another there's no way to work out any numbers uh using the the funnel analogy um and the funnel there are many different versions you'll find about this but almost all of them make this mistake that they mix up the states that are people people are in and the their movement between states so they they will nearly all have um purchase somewhere down that funnel now now purchase the the first purchase event is I'm moving from a state where I'm not a buyer of this product to a state where I am a buyer of product now in our language that's a flow rate everything else in the funnel is a is a stock so you no matter what you do with this thing you can't actually do any working out with it you can't say how many dollars do I need to spend on this in order to get how many dollars of sales come coming out of it um this is a more realistic uh um structure and again there's a working model to go with this uh we do marketing and sales and promotion to push customers up through think of these as tanks up the side of a hill they they all start in the tank of the bottom where they've never heard of us we do some form of mass advertising and that pumps them up to a state where they are aware of it they aren't doing anything else U they aren't they don't understand the product and they're not buying it uh so they are only at this stage aware so we do a different kind of advertising and that makes them informed about the product so they Now understand it they Now understand why they should want it uh I still haven't bought it so we do something else to get them to Thal the product and actually become um uh customers but they might still buy somebody else's product at the same time so they're not not loyal yet so we do other things to make them become loyal customers uh so there's the money going in pumping those pumps up the side of the Hill um but if we don't if we stop doing it they'll all slip down the hill again why why on Earth you might think does Coca colola keep advertising their brands when when everybody on Earth uh understands the product and if they would would ever like it they'll buy it and if they don't then they wouldn't well they have to keep doing it because they they've got to keep those pumps counteracting the the tendency for customers to fall back down that that uh that chain uh and the last bit is that you can get Word of Mouth which is the more people you've got in the top two boxes the faster the the flow rates uh lower down the chain can work so um The Funnel kind of said yes if you're lucky you can get some uh Word of Mouth we can actually make that work and make it happen and what do we do when we've got this well um we can compute what the sales are going to be by adding up the sales to loyal customers and disloyal customers multiply that by the price and that tells us how much revenue we we're going to make subtract the product cost that tells us what the growth profit is take away all those costs of the uh of our Market spend and that tells us how much product contribution the the the the product is going to make um just a side note here this customer this consumer pipeline it it is a it is a marketing specific version of of a still more generic structure which I've I've called an adoption pipeline there are all kinds of things that we want people to start doing behaviors we want them to adopt uh from uh you know uh join joining my singing Club to um uh uh we want doctors to adopt some new way of treating diseases or or we want some uh political party to some political party wants people to adopt the behavior of voting for them um and i' I've just I've published a a blog post on this so if you follow the link here that will tell you a bit more about more widespread uh examples of these Pipelines um and here is a working model that you can play with and it does exactly what I explained on the previous exhibit and here are three scenarios uh that you get out of actually exploring that that model in the blue scenario the the base case is pretty good we we pump people into uh being aware of the product um we then pump them into being informed about it and then we then convert them into actually buying the thing um and uh that that active customers there is the sum of um disloyal unloyal customers and uh on the right hand side I I've shown that after what is that 24 months we we've actually um paid back all of the marketing expenditure that we put in and we're back into a positive cumulative profit so uh what happens if you spend half as much marketing well what do you think happens if you get spend half as much marketing you get half the result no you don't um I actually shared this model with a marketing executive many many years ago who told me that um she had actually uh presented a product launch plan to the company she worked for and they said yeah it's a it's a good plan but we can't afford to spend that marketing uh that you've asked for um so you you can go ahead with a product launch but you can only spend as um half as much and amazingly bravely uh she said in that case I'm not going to do it uh because it won't work and you get your money back and um the pink scenario shows why that would happen spend too little and those backflow rates ensure that you never get enough customers to make your product profitable on the other hand oh maybe we'd do even better if we spent twice as much on marketing uhuh no you've done as much as you can in the blue case to get the customers to buy the thing and to keep buying it just spending more money on marketing is is is throwing throwing money down the drain uh so uh you're just throwing money away by by spending even more on marketing um so here's a little challenge for you all uh if you play with this model you'll discover that you can actually do much much better than the blue scenario here uh if I can give you a little hint about how to do that uh the hint is that you do not continue to spend the same amount of money on all four things across the 36 months you you change how much you spend uh as time goes by across those four activities okay uh final word on on durable products how they are different um here's the structure we've looked at for consumable products uh and it is the customer base that drive sales where does this apply it applies to fast moving consumer goods like beyond meat most retailers it applies to you've got customers who come to your store you know every week or whatever uh many online services social media in that case the revenue is driven through the advertising Revenue rather than uh subscriptions utilities like uh I continue to pay my power supplier every week I continue to pay my insurance premiums every year industrial many industrial materials and components most business services and some software uh so I guess like many of us I subscribe to Microsoft Office 365 so I am a customer of Microsoft Office 365 every year I pay the subscription right now that is not how Microsoft always sold Microsoft Office and I'll I'll explain why in just a moment so the the other model is for a durable model and here it's not the number of customers it's not the stock of customers uh who drive sales uh c those the stock here isn't customers is the wrong word for them they are now owners uh and it's the new buyers who drive sales so imagine I'm in the business of selling swimming pools right there there is a long list of people I have previously owned sold swimming pools to uh my sales in terms of how many thousands of dollars of sales per month I I make is not driven by how many people own uh a pool they previously bought from me uh it's driven by how many new people I can persuade to buy a swinging pool from me uh each each period uh how does this apply this applies for private Vehicles consumer durables like washing machines one-off services like weddings um that there aren't many customers of wedding services who pop back every two or three years saying I'd like another wedding PL and there there are a few maybe in in some of the some sectors of society but but most of us don't do that um many businesso business project Services I need a new office built please you know I'm not going to do that every year for the next 10 years U and now let's let's go back to the old Microsoft Office business model where you pay Microsoft Office I think was it $500 or something you get Microsoft Office you can just keep using it and not pay them anything anything more um like many software suppliers Microsoft tried to extract value from uh their their owner Base by getting them to sign up for service contracts that didn't work that's why they switched over to the model on the left uh Industrial Equipment Works this way you know if I'm building a factory and I need some pumps I bought the pump you I'm not going to keep on buying a new pump every three months um okay uh some products kind of fall halfway in between here uh semi durables things that um wear out uh or or sometimes the just get bored and they want a new one um so there we get firsttime sales and we get repeat sales depending on the fraction of owners who repurchase each period total sales come from those two sources and this applies where there is some loyalty so with private Vehicles if I am a loyal BMW owner I'm not happs but I'd love to be every time I upgrade my my vehicle I will come back for another for another BM BMW right uh most of us are not sorry I don't know whether it's true or not many of us are not um loyal uh technology products um uh you laptop computers you know next time I might buy aell I happen to have a Microsoft Surface but uh clothing brands um people who buy uh night running shoes um they may be persuaded to switch over and buy Adidas or something else uh but uh if as long as they are loyal uh if they win new customers for Nike maybe teenagers who who finally get get uh enough money together to be able to buy their first pair of Nikes then they are the new buyers coming in at the left there uh and then if they love them and they can continue continue to afford them then you get the repeat sales so there's that model in the middle okay now intermediaries I haven't got time to say anything very much about this but if you think about how beyond meat Works uh they are not selling the product to Consumers they're selling the product to uh Walmart and to uh and to McDonald's hopefully um here the the model is that Revenue comes from uh from sales volume multiplied by the price that we charge to the people we sell to so BM uh so beyond meat does not get the price that consumers pay they get the price that the retailers pay um It's the final consumers that drive how what the sales volume is and the uh the the product and service functionality you remember that value curve thing I showed you earlier and the marketing we do is all aimed at getting consumers to want the thing but our sales effort goes into getting our direct customers to stock the product right so marketing a that that's the kind of marketing pull thing we want to pull consumers into the market and then we can go to the retailers and say Hey you really ought to um stock this thing because there's millions of consumers banging on your door saying that they really like it um and our price uh determines the price that the retailers will charge and that determines um the the win and loss rate for consumers and the and the sales rate um just a couple of issues that we haven't got time to deal with but our our models can deal with uh it's the issue of customer quality we don't just want um more customers we want customers who buy more or customers who are more profitable so we would prefer beyond meat consumers who buy every week rather than beyond meat consumers who only buy once once a month right um some customers are more costly to serve so you know they they might be bigger in terms of buying more but actually they're not so profitable because we have to spend so much on looking after them um now this is what's known as an attribute of cons of customers so we want to win better customers if we're going to lose customers at all uh in fact sometimes we might even deliberately want to lose less good customers uh so that we can focus our effort on doing a better job for the better customers uh and for the customers we've got we want to build sales to those current customers uh now we we actually have a a whole class on how to model these uh these uh attributes of um customers um if you were uh sitting in on my seminar about human resources um six or eight weeks ago uh you'll know that we hand we also know how to handle attributes for staff so how skilled are the staff that we employ how experienced are they so we have a whole class on how to build models with for those attributes uh and I've said very little here about competition um there are three Universal mechanisms uh dealing that that capture all competition uh situations can we win customers faster than our competitors when they've got customers can we steal those customers away from them and if customers are not loyal can we get a bigger share of those shared uh customer sales um and um this was actually a class uh seminar three in our series I think uh it certainly an early one in the series uh I've converted that seminar into a short course so if you follow the link here that's a short course which focuses specifically on how competition works and there's a more substantial course on modeling competition so there we go thank you for sticking with me through this Gallop through the marketing and sales field uh you can get the slides for this I I've I've put them up in two forms there's a PDF of of the slides or if you go to the second link that's actually a PowerPoint slideshow so you can actually go through the the slide builds that explain the story a little bit more um do go check out the models and other links in the slides um I hope to be ready today but I but I wasn't so coming soon um we'll um I'll be talking with Fernando about how we give you access to uh more courses on business modeling uh and lastly if you want to follow more about this u i put out a newsletter uh on this kind of stuff probably one or one or two newsletters a week uh on uh issues right across the whole range of things on strategy and um digital twin business models so there we go the end thank you thank you Kim um before we move on to the questions there are waiting here in the chat I just want to share again this quote if you joined um after my short introduction ear in this session we are offering 30% discount for newcomer to join the syic society so you can watch all the recordings from previous sessions in this um series of course it includes all the other benefits the syst damic soite membership offers and you can go to syst dams.org membership um enjoy until Wednesday next week using this uh this code that offers 30% off on your first membership on your first year of your membership and also valid for all the different years of um memberships we offer and let me go here to the chat I saw a couple of questions and let me just scroll I'm actually looking at the chat myself Fernando should I just wiiz down it and yeah sure I saw that me there's a I think the first question starts with Megan so that's where I was to start yeah good question Megan uh yeah C customers trust in in the company uh or the or the product uh that is another of these uh intangible state of mind uh issues we we had um you know is the beyond meat product uh a thing that other people like me would buy that's a that's a feeling that I have about the the product and then um if we move on to the trust issue um then the the longer people spend as active customers um and experience good things like they they like the product and they like the service support then that fills up a stock of trust uh so the the the level of trust it won't start empty because if it was empty they wouldn't buy from you in the first place um but but uh it would start at some level and the the more it it builds up um the less likely a the less likely they are to leave you uh and B um the more likely they are to recommend you to other people um I can just share a little anecdote about this which is that um I probably hold the world record for being with the same bank for the longest period of time I still have the same bank account with the same bank when I opened when I was 16 years old in that time I to my knowledge um the bank has made two mistakes uh and the second time they made a mistake uh I thought well that's not very good you know I've been I've been with you 30 years you really shouldn't make that mistake um a couple of days later uh the doorbell rang and there was a bottle of wine um from the uh from the bank saying very sorry we made a mistake you won't happen again what do you think happened to my level of trust in that bank right um so there we go is that okay Megan yeah uh yes thank you Kim okay so I'm scrolling down to the other questions Kim and and I see a question from Simon I think he already left but we can still answer uh aside from promotions in retail something seasonality P Price is developed in a vacum pricey I don't understand the question maybe I should ask does anyone else understand the question let me let me read it out loud and then we try to figure it out but he's not here anymore so he says aside from promotions in retail and subject to seasonality or other factors price El elasticity is developed in a vacuum have you found similar examples I also don't get really get the question if anyone does get it perhaps I could yeah just yourself and tell us what you think the question is otherwise we'll move on yeah let's move on and then if anyone thinks I think if I if I understand the question that he's saying that usually people just out on the blue with theity value not from real data oh okay I I think the way I explained price elasticity in in that bit of the presentation I think that dealt with it correctly um of course that that PR price elasticity is also going on Visa the the price that our competitors are charging for this for the same for an equivalent product so there'll be the price elasticity also affecting the rate at which we customers are switching between us and our competitors uh oh maybe that's what he means yeah uh yeah we're not the only people setting price um uh and uh yeah if if all the players in the market um reduce the price then the purchase rate across the entire Market will go up which I think we're seeing happening with with electric vehicles at the moment uh I think Chinese manufacturers have really been pushing the price down uh and that that's forced other manufacturers to to follow them down and that is changing you that that is altering the the purchase rate and we're in a different place on that pricing LD uh I think we dealt with the dur with the next question on durable products uh yeah the purchase rate the purchase rate is a is not the well the purchase rate drives the sales uh sorry the the first purchase rate the rate at which people buy the thing for the first time is the the sales rate for for a durable product uh I think I explain that properly uh ah so someone's asking um can they know how these demo models will be built well um the the the uh rough plan at the moment is that we'll round off this seminar series with a a class where I will I will actually take you through building these models um so I'll take you through building a model not not lots of models um and yeah I will I will definitely uh yeah I'm I'm pretty sure I will definitely do that yeah we probably will do that Kim um so can uh let's move on to the Mark Mark's question um yeah but from where you find the info for for the relationship between price and customer lost or one is it a theory or real rate oh yeah yeah yeah oh uh that that's easy um you do you do tests um the the case I I'm I was involved in most significantly concerned uh a a a drinks product you'll think I'm an alcoholic or something I don't only work on alcoholic drink products um but um it happens to concern a a drink product uh that was sold it was being sold in different um uh um regions around Spain um and the company was trying to figure out um that they were trying to improve it the the product sales were falling and they tried to figure out why that was and among the things they tested was what happens if we reduce the price or increase the price uh what does that do to so you carry out consumer research um a controlled trial uh if you go back to the pharmaceutical overthe counter uh uh product we were talking about I can tell you what it was it's a it's a headache pill called Advil um they They carried out trials on you know what happens if the pack price is 20% lower what happens if the pack price is 20% higher relative to the the price that we were previously charging relative to the price of Supermarket own Brands um yeah you you do trials um and the the question when when you when you do the customer research the question you ask is are you a customer of this product and the second question you ask is when did you last buy it and and the third question you ask is um when will you likely next buy it and those three the answer to those three questions between them will tell you how many customers you actually have how fast you're winning them how fast you're losing them and what the purchase rates is so that's that's how you get that um uh that that that information um I'm scrolling down the chat here Kim and there is a question from Jason um he says thanks for sharing lots of marketing knowledge and insights and we have more information about the connection SL application between between these knowledge and system thinking system an ah okay um those of you who who know uh more about my background will know that I started out with the System Dynamics the same way everybody pretty much everyone else did which is um with uh systems thinking approaches trying to figure out what the feedback loops in the in the situation are so in in these cases we're talking about how many customers do I have what word of mouth will uh what will Word of Mouth contribute to the rate at which I get new new customers and I do a qualitative feedback diagram that shows that what is going to limit the number of customers I have well the the the falling number of potential customers so I do a feedback loop that says the more customers I have the fewer remaining potential customers I have and that will slow down the the the the rate of new customers so you you can draw that out in a qualitative clb kind of way um uh you if if I do the class where I actually show you how to build these models I must remember to include this bit in it I will make the case that uh you can get to a working model faster if you don't do that right controversial I know and people will throw things at me uh but I've been doing this a long time and I firmly believe it to be to be true uh sorry any any more uh did I answer his question fully yeah yeah the every every model I've shared with you there is a systems thinking diagrammatic equivalent um uh to those which which I I haven't got time to to say more about today but there is a there is a direct par between them um thank you Kim I have a question here from Lise actually he said it only for myself but I think it's worth repeating for everyone he's asking how to redeem uh how to use this uh codes to to get your certificate um so you you need to collect at least six of these codes out of the nine that we have uh you can watch the recordings of course if you already join and took note of it and I will create an interface where you can share these codes with me so that I have a um a way of making sure that you at least watch the requiring and then I'll generate that certificate for you so that information I will send via email for everyone who joined not only this one but all the previous um seminars in this series and that leaves us to the last question I think and thank you Kim and thank you everyone for joining unless there is any other questions I think we can wrap up thank you everybody for joining us thank you everyone I really hope that you guys enjoyed the series um we're probably gonna hear from us because me as as Kim said at the beginning we already talked and I think that uh having a class um for everyone who wants to actually have a practice call um class for that I think would be really really great Kim so we I we will share information very soon about that too it'll be fun as well that's the other thing to say about it as well as useful yeah and sorry I forgot to to answer Louis the last part of your question was how much it costs the certificate doesn't cost anything is is if you're part of the if you have a membership with the syst anomic society that is included in your benefits uh presumably for non-members if they pay for access to the uh U the recordings that they get it too for free yeah yeah but I think that would it would be cheaper for them to join the society instead of paying for each individual uh seminar in this series and getting not only this series but also all the the recordings and other benefits of the society so there's there's a good reason why you should join the society yes than thank you everyone thank you Kim for for this amazing U almost nine nine webinars so I'm looking forward to have a final class hopefully soon I'm going to hibernate now thank you everyone have a good uh rest of the week byebye
