shared resource constrain tech adoption
both sides of cloud

cloud can both constrain (fit, dependence) and enable (modular data analytics) adoption
angular distance btw bundle of technology 

using cloud it impacts tech stack breadth (standardized)
- standardized (-> more investment ) -> find the quickest path to get there

great ideas don't sell themselves: disclosure #paradox
bob kearns, windshield wiper (ford took prototype) 20 yr suing

contentious struggle (both invented) - winklevoss twins

inventors should be innovators

modelling idea sale under no disclosure
what ideas are easier / difficult to sell

best ideas are most difficult to sell (refused by the best ideas)
how much value buyer and seller (seller protection and verification)
request buyer to sign

revenue verification, but not NDAs
ask agent to (exposed to verified revenue - report highter)

structural estimation of lost gains from trade -  lose 50% / compare perfect and imperfect 

conclusion
- best ideas are harder to sell when disclosure is unsafe
- arrow's disclosure paradox harms society if few ideas are disproportionately valuable
