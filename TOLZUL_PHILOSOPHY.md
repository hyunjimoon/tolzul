# TOLZUL: 똘똘하게 모여서 절절하게

## Four-Chain Philosophy

**1_🐢 ACCULTURATE-EVALUATE**: Who you're becoming  
**2_👾 SEGMENT-REPLICATE-CAPITALIZE**: Who you're serving  
**3_🐅 PROFESSIONALIZE-PROCESSIFY**: How you're operating  
**4_🐙 COLLABORATE-AUTOMATE-PLATFORMIZE**: What you're producing

Today's date mod 10:
0-2 → 🐢 Who you're becoming     (⚡toltol/🧲zulzul balance)
3-4 → 👾 Who you're serving      (🎓professors/📚students)
5-6 → 🐅 How you're operating    (🫀bayes/👀innovate/✋operate)
7-9 → 🐙 What you're producing   (👓education/📜papers)
```

## $/time Flow
```
WHO YOU'RE BECOMING → WHO YOU'RE SERVING → HOW YOU'RE OPERATING → WHAT YOU'RE PRODUCING

## Joker Framework
- **Exploit** (low variance): Optimize existing chains
- **Explore** (high variance): Create new value flows

## Weekly Balance Check
| Chain | Target | R-hat Check |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐢 | 30% | Balancing ⚡speed & 🧲depth? |
| 👾 | 20% | Understanding user needs? |
| 🐅 | 25% | Strengthening core operations? |
| 🐙 | 25% | Creating valuable outputs? |

**R-hat** = max(actual%/target%, target%/actual%)  
✅ < 1.1 | ⚠️ 1.1-1.5 | ❌ > 1.5
