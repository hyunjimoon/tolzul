# Class 2: JetBlue Capacity & Variability (✈️)
*July 22, 2025 | [Transcript](2🍔✈️15778_intro_ops_otter_ai.md)*

## 🎯 Teaching Arc
**Hook**: "40% utilization yet massive delays - why?"  
**Puzzle**: ⭐️Flights ebb and flow → 1.7hr delays  
**Resolution**: ⭐️Variability causes delays (quantified from Burger King)  
**Model**: ⭐️36% demand increase → 100% delay increase (NONLINEAR)

## 📚 Exam Essentials
**Key Insights**:
- ⭐️σ/√T: More aggregated → lower variability
- ⭐️Clock asymmetry: Customers think minutes, suppliers hours
- ⭐️Burst causes delays (no minute-by-minute planning)

**Math**: 58→75 flights (+36%) → 1.7→3.6hr delay (+110%)

**Traps**: ❌"Low utilization = waste" ✅"Buffer for variability"

## 🎓 Recitation Points
- "Two flights delay → four in process"
- "Peak demand bursts overwhelm system"
- "Process redesign hard across 5k stores"
