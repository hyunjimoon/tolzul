# Venture Pitch Evaluation Rubric - 15.778 Summer 2025
## Based on Operations for Entrepreneurship: Nail Before Scale Framework

### Core Philosophy
Following the "nail before scale" principle, ventures must prove their value proposition as a **promise that mobilizes resources**. This promise must demonstrate both **sellability** (value) and **deliverability** (feasibility).

## Grading Structure
- **Base Score**: 94/100
- **Additional Points**: 6 points total
  - Process Quality: 3 points
  - Product Quality: 3 points

---

## I. PROCESS QUALITY (3 points)
*How well does the team demonstrate operational thinking in developing their venture?*

### A. Problem-Solution Fit Process (1 point)
**Key Question**: Did the team follow a systematic process to identify and validate the operational problem?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Evidence of customer discovery (not just assumptions)
- Clear problem definition rooted in operational inefficiency
- Validation of problem severity and frequency
- Connection between problem and proposed solution

**Rating**:
- **(+1.0)**: Systematic validation with evidence, clear operational root cause analysis
- **(+0.5)**: Some validation effort, basic problem-solution connection
- **(0)**: Assumptions without validation, unclear problem definition

### B. Capability Development Process (1 point)
**Key Question**: Does the team show a thoughtful sequence for building required capabilities?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Identification of core capabilities needed
- Realistic sequencing (what to nail first)
- Resource requirements mapped to capabilities
- Learning milestones defined

**Rating**:
- **(+1.0)**: Clear capability roadmap with dependencies and milestones
- **(+0.5)**: Basic capability list with some sequencing logic
- **(0)**: Vague or unrealistic capability assumptions

### C. Stakeholder Mobilization Process (1 point)
**Key Question**: How well does the team plan to mobilize key resources?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Strategy for attracting employees
- Plan for engaging collaborators (manufacturers, tech partners)
- Approach to securing financial resources
- Customer acquisition methodology

**Rating**:
- **(+1.0)**: Specific mobilization strategies for each stakeholder type
- **(+0.5)**: General awareness of stakeholder needs
- **(0)**: No clear plan for resource mobilization

## II. PRODUCT QUALITY (3 points)
*How compelling is the venture's value proposition and its feasibility?*

### A. Sellability - Value Proposition Strength (1.5 points)
**Key Question**: Is this a promise that stakeholders will buy into?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Customer Value**: Clear, quantified benefit that customers will pay for
- **Employee Value**: Why talent would join this venture
- **Investor Value**: Compelling returns and growth potential
- **Partner Value**: Win-win proposition for collaborators

**Sub-ratings** (0.375 each):
- Customer sellability: ___/0.375
- Employee sellability: ___/0.375
- Investor sellability: ___/0.375
- Partner sellability: ___/0.375

### B. Deliverability - Operational Feasibility (1.5 points)
**Key Question**: Can this team credibly deliver on their promise?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can the operations/technology be built?
- **Economic Feasibility**: Do unit economics work at small scale?
- **Organizational Feasibility**: Can this team execute?
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Is the development schedule realistic?

**Sub-ratings** (0.375 each):
- Technical deliverability: ___/0.375
- Economic deliverability: ___/0.375
- Organizational deliverability: ___/0.375
- Timeline deliverability: ___/0.375

## Application Guidelines

### What "Nailing" Looks Like
- Small-scale proof that the model works
- One delighted customer segment before expanding
- Core capability demonstrated, not just promised
- Metrics that prove value creation

### Red Flags for "Premature Scaling"
- Trying to serve everyone from day one
- Building all features before validating core value
- Hiring for growth before proving the model
- Geographic expansion before local success

### Operations Lens Requirements
Teams must demonstrate understanding of at least ONE:
- Capacity-demand matching
- Inventory-service tradeoffs
- Process improvement opportunities
- Platform/network effects
- Supply chain coordination
- Quality-cost tradeoffs
