# manual note
guide inventory so that we sell out in the last week

---
if i had a crystal ball of demand, i could have (95%)

derek: could have run the last four weeks slower

optimization: principled discussion on objective and constraints
mike: 
- re-optimize at week 5, 10 (hit solver three times)
- two benefit of re-optimize (data source)
	- historical data from w1~5 (allows me to build better demand model)
	- actual inventory (unpredictable variability; i might have sold; account for natural variation)
	- hold on to that 80% longer
	- stick with 80% one week more (as demand is healthier)

üó£Ô∏è i'm beginning to think multiple period condition of 

updating demand model rather than using the original regression

redo the w5 solver, how does this change
- pricing at $80 (x_80, x_90 would disapper as we ); i
- x_80 + x_60 <=11 (week count), data from the first five weeks to update the 84, 111, 180
- you expected to solve 90, but you sold 95 - adjust

using [llm](https://poe.com/s/YWZWU1fDoRUwDMuxoMG0), d is the output of updated demand prediction model which becomes coefficient that included in both objective (revenue =  price * count) and count constraint

### **Steps for Re-optimization in Gurobi**

1. **Initial Optimization (Week 0):**
    
    - Define the model with:
        - Objective: `Maximize: 100(64x‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ) + 90(84x‚Çâ‚ÇÄ) + 80(111x‚Çà‚ÇÄ) + 60(180x‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ)`
        - Constraints:
            - Time: `x‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ + x‚Çâ‚ÇÄ + x‚Çà‚ÇÄ + x‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ ‚â§ 16`
            - Inventory: `64x‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ + 84x‚Çâ‚ÇÄ + 111x‚Çà‚ÇÄ + 180x‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ ‚â§ 2000`
2. **Observe Weekly Sales:**
    
    - After each week (or batch of weeks), collect:
        - **Units Sold**: Actual sales data for each

## Required Readings
- **[SaaS Metrics 2.0: A Guide to Measuring and Improving What Matters](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/)**

### SaaS Metrics Article Key Insights:

**Core SaaS Principles:**
1. **Customer Acquisition:** Getting new customers
2. **Customer Retention:** Keeping customers engaged and subscribed
3. **Customer Monetization:** Increasing revenue per customer over time

**Critical Metrics:**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Total cost to acquire a new customer
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** Should be >3:1 for healthy SaaS businesses
- **Months to Recover CAC:** Should be <12 months, ideally 5-7 months
- **Churn Rate:** Monthly customer/revenue loss rate
- **Net Negative Churn:** When expansion revenue exceeds churn losses

**Unit Economics Framework:**
Can you make more profit from customers than it costs to acquire them? This fundamental question drives all operational decisions in subscription businesses.

## Key Concepts

### Customer Choice Modeling
- **Discrete Choice Theory:** How customers select among alternatives
- **Utility Functions:** Mathematical representation of customer preferences
- **Price Sensitivity:** Elasticity of demand to price changes
- **Substitution Patterns:** How customers switch between products

### Product Assortment Optimization
- **Attribute-Based Approach:** Focus on product characteristics customers value
- **Sales Data Limitations:** Past performance doesn't predict future preferences
- **Cannibalization Effects:** How new products affect existing sales
- **Variety vs. Complexity:** Trade-off between choice and operational efficiency

### Subscription Business Models
- **Recurring Revenue:** Predictable income streams
- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Total revenue over customer relationship
- **Retention Focus:** Keeping customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones
- **Expansion Revenue:** Upselling and cross-selling to existing customers

## Blue Apron Case Analysis

### Business Model Overview
- **Meal Kit Delivery:** Pre-portioned ingredients with recipes
- **Subscription Model:** Weekly recurring deliveries
- **Customer Acquisition:** High marketing spend to acquire subscribers
- **Operational Challenges:** Complex supply chain and logistics

### Unit Economics Challenges
**High Customer Acquisition Costs:**
- **CAC Problem:** Very expensive to acquire customers through marketing
- **LTV Challenge:** Low customer lifetime value due to high churn
- **Unit Economics:** CAC often exceeded LTV, making business unsustainable

**Churn Issues:**
- **Novelty Factor:** Initial excitement wears off quickly
- **Convenience vs. Cost:** Customers find alternatives more convenient/cheaper
- **Product-Market Fit:** Unclear if there's sustainable long-term demand

### Operational Implications
**Supply Chain Complexity:**
- **Fresh Ingredients:** Short shelf life requires precise demand forecasting
- **Portion Control:** Exact quantities needed for each meal
- **Logistics:** Cold chain distribution with tight delivery windows
- **Waste Management:** High perishability leads to significant waste

**Customer Experience:**
- **Meal Variety:** Need to continuously innovate recipes
- **Dietary Preferences:** Customization adds operational complexity
- **Delivery Reliability:** Service quality affects retention

### Strategic Questions
1. **Unit Economics:** How can Blue Apron improve its LTV:CAC ratio?
2. **Retention Strategy:** What operational changes could reduce churn?
3. **Market Position:** Is the business model fundamentally viable?
4. **Competitive Advantage:** What sustainable differentiators exist?

## Product Assortment Case Analysis

### Traditional Approach Problems
- **Sales-Based Decisions:** Drop products with low sales volume
- **Ignores Customer Preferences:** Doesn't consider why products succeed/fail

### Attribute-Based Optimization
**Customer Preference Modeling:**
- **Conjoint Analysis:** Understand relative importance of product attributes
- **Choice Experiments:** Test customer preferences under controlled conditions

- **Behavioral Data:** Actual purchase patterns and sequences

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Better Forecasting:** Predict demand for new products based on attributes
- **Strategic Assortment:** Design product mix to maximize customer satisfaction
- **Reduced Risk:** Data-driven decisions rather than intuition
- **Competitive Advantage:** Unique assortments competitors can't easily copy

## Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

### CLV Calculation Framework
**Basic Formula:**
- CLV = (Average Revenue per Customer) √ó (Gross Margin %) √ó (Customer Lifespan)

**Advanced DCF Approach:**
- Account for time value of money
- Include acquisition and retention costs
- Consider expansion revenue potential
- Factor in churn probability over time

### Operational Decision Making
**Investment Justification:**
- **Customer Service:** How much to invest in retention?
- **Product Development:** Which features drive long-term value?
- **Acquisition Channels:** Which sources provide highest-value customers?
- **Pricing Strategy:** How to maximize long-term customer value?

**Segmentation Strategy:**
- **High-Value Customers:** Provide premium service and retention focus
- **Growth Customers:** Invest in expansion and upselling
- **At-Risk Customers:** Targeted retention campaigns
- **Low-Value Customers:** Cost-efficient service models

## Choice Modeling Applications

### Revenue Management Extensions
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices based on demand elasticity
- **Product Bundling:** Combine products to increase customer value
- **Personalization:** Customize offerings to individual preferences
- **Capacity Allocation:** Optimize inventory mix for customer choice

### Supply Chain Implications
- **Demand Forecasting:** Better predictions based on customer preferences
- **Inventory Planning:** Stock levels aligned with choice patterns
