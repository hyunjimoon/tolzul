# Class 11: Supply Chain Resilience (⏰)
*Aug 7, 2025 | [Transcript](11⏰2RS_15778_intro_ops_otter_ai.md)*

## 🎯 Teaching Arc
**Hook**: "Nokia survived, Ericsson failed - same fire, different outcomes"  
**Puzzle**: Phillips semiconductor fire affected both - why different impacts?  
**Resolution**: ⭐️Time to survive > Time to recovery = survive  
**Model**: Impact × Recovery Time × Probability (order by PI when TTS>TTR)

## 🗣️ Quality Participation

**[Student]**: "Alternative suppliers matter"
- Prof: "I like where your head's at"
- Impact: Led to multi-sourcing discussion

**Key Discussion**: ⭐️HIGH IMPACT, NO MONEY suppliers
- Prof: "Exactly - low-cost suppliers can cripple you"
- Insight: Semiconductor makers = high risk despite low spend

## 📊 Quick Scores
**Track professor's cues**: "exactly", "I like that", "good point"  
**Focus on**: Students who identify non-obvious risks

### Nokia's Resilience
```
    🟢 Supply visibility      🟣 Continuity need
       Multi-sourcing            Reliability
            \                    /
              Coordinate ←→ Compel
            /                    \
    🟠 Min disruption        🔴 Stable supply
       Quick recovery           Customer trust
```

### Risk Framework
```
    🟢 Map suppliers         🟣 Business continuity
       Know TTR                 Zero disruption
            \                    /
              Coordinate ←→ Compel
            /                    \
    🟠 ⭐️Assume recovery    🔴 Risk transparency
       Invest flexibility       Supply assurance
```

## 📚 Exam Essentials
**Concepts**: 
- ⭐️Proactive (map TTR, TTS, PI) > Reactive (culture)
- Focus on high impact + low visibility suppliers
- Design flexibility where it matters

**Strategy**: 
1. Map impact as function of recovery time
2. When TTS < TTR → invest in flexibility
3. Order interventions by probability × impact

**Key Table**: Product/Supplier matrix showing safety stock duration

**Traps**: 
❌"Focus on high-spend suppliers" 
✅"Map by impact, not spend"

## 🎓 Recitation Points
- "2015 data revealed low-cost = high-risk suppliers"
- "Nokia's advantage: knew suppliers' suppliers"
- "Resilience investment: where TTS < TTR"
- ⭐️"Underestimate negative tail, overestimate positive tail"
