# Eight Entrepreneurial Experimentation Models

|Model|Customer-Resource Relationship|Time Horizon|Uncertainty Type|Description|Key Operations Challenges|Relevant Bayesian Methods|Potential Research Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1**|Independent|Single Period|Epistemic|Basic experimentation model where customer and resource partner decisions are made independently in a single time frame with knowledge uncertainty.|Optimizing resource allocation for one-time tests; minimal supply chain complexity|Prior elicitation from domain experts; simple Bayesian updating|Foundation for more complex models; easiest starting point for mathematical tractability|
|**2S**|Independent|Single Period|Aleatoric|Similar to Model 1 but with randomness/noise in outcomes rather than knowledge gaps. Focuses on single experiments with statistical uncertainty.|Robust optimization under noise; need for multiple trials to reduce statistical variance|Stochastic sampling methods; Monte Carlo simulations|Critical for establishing statistical validity of early-stage experiments|
|**2T**|Independent|Multiple Periods|Epistemic|Extension of Model 1 to sequential experimentation over time, maintaining independence between customer and resource decisions.|Temporal resource scheduling; managing sequential dependencies|Dynamic Bayesian networks; sequential hypothesis testing|Valuable for understanding learning trajectories in entrepreneurial settings|
|**2U**|Independent|Multiple Periods|Epistemic|Similar to 2T but with focus on transitioning from independent to dependent utility functions over time.|Changing objective functions; evolving optimization targets|Utility adaptation models; non-stationary inference|Explains how enterprises develop interdependencies as they mature|
|**3TS**|Dependent|Multiple Periods|Aleatoric|Model where customer and resource partner choices affect each other over multiple time periods under statistical uncertainty.|Supply chain coordination under noise; feedback loop management|Time series Bayesian models; hidden Markov models|Models how customer-supplier relationships evolve with operational complexity|
|**3TU**|Dependent|Multiple Periods|Epistemic|Similar to 3TS but with epistemic uncertainty, focusing on knowledge gaps in interdependent relationships.|Joint learning across supply chain; coordinated experiments|Hierarchical Bayesian models; cooperative learning frameworks|Shows how knowledge transfer occurs across entrepreneurial networks|
|**3US**|Dependent|Multiple Periods|Aleatoric|Model expanding from basic to complex uncertainty patterns (known unknowns to unknown unknowns).|Managing increasingly complex uncertainty structures|Non-parametric Bayesian methods; Bayesian surprise measures|Valuable for modelling evolving risk landscapes in entrepreneurial ventures|
|**4TUS**|Dependent|Multiple Periods|Aleatoric|Most complex model integrating all dimensions - interdependent stakeholders, multiple time periods, and complex uncertainty structures.|Full supply chain optimization under complex uncertainty; multi-period coordination|Integrated Bayesian decision systems; simulation-based inference|Highest research value; represents the frontier of operations for entrepreneurship research|

## üíö The Solution: STRAP (Strategic Threshold Resolution for Actionable Priorities)

STRAP provides a comprehensive framework for entrepreneurial decision-making built on a fundamental equivalence: systematically reducing uncertainty directly increases venture success probability. The framework consists of two integrated modules:

### 1. Perception Module

- Maps venture attributes to stakeholder choice probabilities using Bayesian logit models
- Quantifies uncertainty through information-theoretic entropy measurements
- Enables simultaneous modeling of all key stakeholders (investors, customers, regulators)

### 2. Action Module

- Formulates a primal-dual optimization problem to balance uncertainty reduction with threshold satisfaction
- Provides a unified decision rule: select actions that maximize information gain per resource unit
- Identifies true operational bottlenecks through dual variables representing constraint significance

### Key Innovations

- **Long Chain Flexibility**: Creates connections between stakeholders to propagate benefits across multiple domains
- **Dual Variables Framework**: Measures entrepreneurial effectiveness through threshold shadow prices (Œªj) and resource shadow price (Œ≥)
- **Resource-Rational Optimization**: Automatically balances exploration and exploitation based on uncertainty values
