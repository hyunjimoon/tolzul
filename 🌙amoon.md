I'm a Ph.D. at MIT studying innovation and operations management with [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/),  [Scott Stern](https://www.scott-stern.com/), [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/). My past and future in [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fa14fcd5ihdq014k6v4h0/Angie-Moon-Resume.pdf?rlkey=y7eerk8e6yx028es2rq7vjmid&dl=0). 

I use probability, statistics, optimization theory to model entrepreneurial decision making. My main tool is probabilistic program. 

I'm eager to bring forth the world where every knows and acts to live an ergodic life, which I'm experimenting with my life:
 
- **Outer orbit**: Bridging Bayesian methods with entrepreneurship evaluation ([[💭theorize(💸)]])
- **Middle orbit**: Converting theory into practical computational assessment tools ([[📐produce(💭)]])
- **Inner orbit**: Teaching embodied modeling philosophies through experiential learning ([[♻️diagnose]])

The crescent moon (🌙) traversing these orbits represents my journey—sometimes closer to theory, sometimes application, always guided by meaningful evaluation.
