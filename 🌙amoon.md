I'm currently a Ph.D. at MIT, majoring operations and innovation management, advised by  [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/). 
I did my pre-doc, in MIT Sloan System dynamics group, developing [stanify](https://github.com/Data4DM/stanify) to bridge statistics and dynamic decision making. This is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16aQlWytJ3xfhcHdg-j698uGBD_hZIBXG/view?usp=drive_link).

My  vision is to bridge Bayesian entrepreneurship with probabilistic program through both process and product innovation, especially for scaling startups. Synthesizing Bayesian Entrepreneurship frameworks of Professors Charles Fine and Scott Stern with the Probabilistic Program Platform pioneered by Professors Vikash Mansinghka and Andrew Gelman, I am building tools that capture how startups navigate key choices around customers, technology, organization and competition. 

What affects my brain and mind:
- goal
	- living ergodic life
	- global productization of entrepreneurial operations theory for startups 
	- [[üëìsynthesize(ops4innov)]]: contributing to scaling [bayesian entrepreneurship (BE)](https://www.entrepreneurial-strategy.net/) and [probabilistic computing (PC)](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/) by bridging them as described [here](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/234) and [here](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/224)
-  [[üåôamoon()]] describes atoms (statistics) and bits (strategy) of my mechanism
- [[üåèworld(amoon)]] archives bits and atoms of world that affected me
- belief: Bayes is my religion, simulation forms me. I live by the spirit of gradual updates with simulation-based reliability checks. I believe Bayesian workflow, [simulation-based calibration ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02383.pdf)¬†in specific, offers business modeling principles.
- cross-section of my brain based on ecosystem management experiences of
	- startup ([[def(nextopt)]] CEO)
	- education community (textbook Bayesian Data Analysis translators), 
	- open-source ([Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/), [SBC](https://hyunjimoon.github.io/SBC/)).
