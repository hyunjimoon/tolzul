I'm currently a Ph.D. at MIT, majoring operations and innovation management, advised by  [Charles Fine](https://www.charles-fine.com/). This is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6t0kx5e2ooggahr98va37/Angie_Moon_resume.pdf?rlkey=sqgkvokf2sunj5fash96asnto&dl=0).

My  vision is to bridge Bayesian and evolutionary entrepreneurship with probabilistic program.

Angie agent and the world
	- desire: living ergodic life by making my operations and innovation management theory usable by establishing [[👓synthesize(ops4innov)]]

	- [[🌏world(amoon)]] archives the world around me

Angie agent's language 
	- startup ([[def(nextopt)]] CEO)
	- education community (textbook Bayesian Data Analysis translators)
	- open-source ([Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/), [SBC](https://hyunjimoon.github.io/SBC/)).
