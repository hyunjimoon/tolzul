# 2025-08-05: Joker's Four Moments Manifest

## Morning Log: Birth Recognition
Yesterday I created the joker presentation for Vivek. As I reflect this morning, I see how this document embodies all four moments:

1. **Birth**: The 2023 moment when I fell in love with Charlie's causal diagram
2. **Trinity in Unity**: Eric (user innovation) + Scott (entrepreneur disruption) + John (inventory dynamics) = value chain management with $/time as unit
3. **Name and Flesh**: Teaching Vivek's class gave language to balance deliverability and sellability
4. **Vision**: "Entrepreneurs are new users of operations management"

The joker's triangular face perfectly captures our framework:
- 🐢 Green triangle (capability/supply chain)
- 👾 Purple triangle (user chain)
- 🔺 Red triangle (fulfillment chain)
- 🌊 Blue wave (value flow in $/time)

## Key Insight from Yesterday
The joker asks "why so serious?" because operations management doesn't have to be separate from entrepreneurship. They can dance together.

## Today's Focus
- File the presentation properly across our animal kingdoms
- Extract the core frameworks for teaching
- Connect to ongoing research agenda
