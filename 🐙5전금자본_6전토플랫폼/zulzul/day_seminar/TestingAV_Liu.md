michigan has AV test facility 
intelligent transpo system 
- safety validation of AV
- mcity test facility is first purpose built proving ground for connected. automated vehicles
- winter is coming for av which forecasted 10million (drop of valuation: remo, auror, zooks)
- fatality is 1/10^6
- weather, road infrastructure, road users, maneuvers,
- av must give way to emergency vehicle even it has the right of way 
- 10^-4 large imbalance ratio
- expectation wouldn't change
- converge to same accident rate, real vehicle (virtual vehicles are controlled )
- quantum signal ai (from ford)

I just 
differentiate 
optimizing for the variance but not the mean; why should the agent 

derivation of reward is coming from importance sampling (actual function is from neural network)

- p.31: what, when, how: 15% of adversearial behavior; can we just cut and paste adverserial behavior?
