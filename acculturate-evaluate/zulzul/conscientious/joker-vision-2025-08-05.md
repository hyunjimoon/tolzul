## Vision Statement Refined
"Entrepreneurs are new users of operations management. We, OM scholars can deliver compelling theories for entrepreneurs. Charlie and Angie deliver entrepreneurship theory and education sellable to entrepreneurs. Let's improve our reality with entrepreneurs and as entrepreneurs."

## The Joker's Gift to Vision
The joker framework shows us that operations and entrepreneurship aren't opposites - they're dance partners. The triangular face represents:
- Integration not separation
- Playfulness not just seriousness
- Value creation through $/time optimization

## Strategic Implications
1. Position ourselves as the bridge between OM and entrepreneurship
2. Use the visual language of triangles and flows
3. Embrace both exploit AND explore strategies
4. Make "deliverability and sellability" our mantra

## Research Agenda Sketch
- Theoretical: Formalize the three-chain value model
- Empirical: Test $/time metrics across industries
- Pedagogical: Develop joker-inspired teaching methods
- Practical: Create tools for entrepreneur-operators

"Why so serious?" - Because serious impact requires playful innovation.
