[first episode] Richard Hendricks is a low-level programmer with futuristic internet giant Hooli. He is often taunted by his more successful work colleagues, and his ideas are dismissed by egotistical entrepreneur Erlich Bachman, who owns the tech development incubator where Richard lives with fellow programmers Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti, Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai. However when Hooli stumbles upon the music copyright service that Richard is working on, entitled Pied Piper, they discover that hidden within the useless application is the best file compression algorithm in the world, and news spreads quickly. Eventually Richard is caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory; he must decide whether to give up his program to the highest bidder, or to take the investment and create a business out of it himself. After having a panic attack and vomiting, Richard runs into Peter's assistant Monica, who tells him that she believes in him and his idea. Richard decides to take the investment, and run the business himself. ChatGPT said: Mapping the first episode of "Silicon Valley" to the startup operational actions (gene) framework involves analyzing the episode's events and categorizing them according to the defined operational actions: Atom supply/architecture (A), Technology/organization (T), Goal (G), Customer (C), and Energy (E). Here's a systematic explanation of how each aspect of the gene framework applies to the episode:

A (Atom supply/architecture) Evaluation: In the first episode, Richard and his team pass the operational feasibility test by having a viable product (Pied Piper) with a unique value proposition (the best file compression algorithm). The ecosystem at this stage is primarily the tech incubator and the broader tech community aware of Pied Piper's potential.

Capabilities: Richard's initial steps include implementing the business model canvas implicitly by considering the investment from Peter Gregory, which would allow for delivery capability enhancement. The episode touches on organizational structuring with the decision to take the investment and run the business, indicating the beginning of a strategy for growth and partnerships (with Peter Gregory).

T (Technology/organization) Evaluation: The technology feasibility test is passed with the discovery of Pied Piper's compression algorithm, showcasing a significant technological innovation. The episode focuses on the refinement of Pied Piper to improve its quality and market feasibility.

Capabilities: The key activity here is the development of Pied Piper's technology. The decision to accept Peter Gregory's investment over Hooli's buyout offer reflects a commitment to further technology development and proof of concept.

G (Goal) Evaluation: Richard's aspiration to build his own company rather than sell his technology outright is a clear indication of his orientation towards innovation and control over execution. This satisfies the entrepreneur's aspiration test by choosing a path that aligns with his belief in the product's potential.

Capabilities: The episode showcases Richard's aspirations for market size and potential revenue through his decision-making process, reflecting a belief in the product-market fit and the potential for significant customer acquisition.

C (Customer) Evaluation: While the episode does not explicitly detail customer segmentation or market verification, Richard's dilemma and eventual choice hint at an underlying consideration for who the ultimate customers of Pied Piper could be and how the market could be developed beyond a simple buyout.

Capabilities: The initial feedback and interest from both Hooli and Peter Gregory serve as a form of market research, indicating a demand for Pied Piper's technology.

E (Energy) Evaluation: The financial uncertainty is addressed through Peter Gregory's investment offer, which represents a crucial step towards financial viability and extends the "time of death" for Pied Piper by providing the necessary resources to develop the product further.

Uncertainty: The decision to take the investment over the buyout offer increases the financial stability of Pied Piper, allowing for future growth and development.

In summary, the first episode of "Silicon Valley" illustrates the early stages of a startup's journey, focusing on the development of a unique technology (T), the establishment of a business model and organizational structure (A), setting and pursuing entrepreneurial goals (G), beginning to consider the customer market (C), and securing initial funding to mitigate financial uncertainty (E). This mapping provides a clear overview of how the startup operational actions framework can be applied to a narrative to extract and summarize key entrepreneurial activities.

You said: imagine this as a reinforcement problem formulation where State space: score of operational feasibility test(o_t), technology feasibility test (t_t), employee's desirability test (e_t), customer's desirability test (c_t), investor's desirability test (i_t) \in{0, \ldots, M}. Action space: A, T, G, C

using [inventory management's RL formulation], what should be the state transition and reward?

for instance, " technology feasibility test is passed with the discovery of Pied Piper's compression algorithm, showcasing a significant technological innovation." tells action T increased technology feasibility test state by 1.

[inventory management's RL formulation] Our inventory has maximum size $M$. At each step $t$, we have $0 \leq s_t \leq M$ items in our inventory. In step $t$ we may restock any amount $a_t$ of items, as long as the total number of items remains $M$ or lower. After we restock, we receives orders for $D_t$ items and we fulfill as many of these orders as possible (the rest of the orders are ignored). At each step, the restock cost is modeled by $C\left(a_t\right)$, the revenue is modeled by $f$ (number of items sold), and the holding cost (cost to store the items) is modeled by $h\left(s_t+a_t\right)$.

State space: $s_t \in{0, \ldots, M}$ Action space: $a_t \in\left{0, \ldots, M-s_t\right}$ State transition: $s_{t+1}=\left[s_t+a_t-D_t\right]^{+}$ Reward: $r_t\left(s_t, a_t\right)=-c\left(a_t\right)+f\left(\left[s_t+a_t-s_{t+1}\right]^{+}\right)-h\left(s_t+a_t\right)$ Objective:

max‚Å°[‚àët=0‚àûŒ≥trt(st,at)]\max \left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t\left(s_t, a_t\right)\right]

ChatGPT said: To adapt the reinforcement learning (RL) formulation from inventory management to the context of startup operational actions, we can draw parallels between the two scenarios. The state space in the startup context includes the scores of various feasibility and desirability tests, while the action space consists of operational actions that a startup might take (A, T, G, C). Here's how we can define the state transition and reward in this context:

# State Space Let's define the state at time ùë° t as a vector of the scores of operational feasibility test ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ), technology feasibility test ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ), employee's desirability test ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ), customer's desirability test ( ùëê ùë° c t ‚Äã ), and investor's desirability test ( ùëñ ùë° i t ‚Äã ), where each score is in the set { 0 , ‚Ä¶ , ùëÄ } {0,‚Ä¶,M}. Thus, the state space is: ùë† ùë°

( ùëú ùë° , ùë° ùë° , ùëí ùë° , ùëê ùë° , ùëñ ùë° ) s t ‚Äã =(o t ‚Äã ,t t ‚Äã ,e t ‚Äã ,c t ‚Äã ,i t ‚Äã )

Action Space The action space consists of the operational actions a startup might take: Atom supply/architecture (A), Technology/organization (T), Goal (G), Customer (C). Each action is aimed at improving one or more aspects of the state vector: ùê¥ ùë° ‚àà { ùê¥ , ùëá , ùê∫ , ùê∂ } A t ‚Äã ‚àà{A,T,G,C}

# State Transition The state transition reflects how the startup's actions affect its scores in various areas. For example, taking action ùëá T (focusing on Technology/organization) might improve the technology feasibility test score ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ). The state transition can be modeled as: ùë† ùë° + 1

update ( ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° , Œî ) s t+1 ‚Äã =update(s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã ,Œî) where Œî Œî represents the change in scores due to the action taken. The exact update function would depend on the action and its impact, which could vary based on the current state and external factors.

# Reward The reward function in this context could reflect the progress towards reducing uncertainty, attracting investment, and moving closer to market launch. It could be defined as a combination of improvements in the feasibility and desirability scores, minus the costs associated with the actions taken (such as investment in technology development, market research, etc.). For simplicity, let's define a generic reward function as: ùëü ùë° ( ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° )

‚àë ùëñ ‚àà { ùëú , ùë° , ùëí , ùëê , ùëñ } Œî ùëñ ‚àí ùê∂ ( ùê¥ ùë° ) r t ‚Äã (s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã )=‚àë i‚àà{o,t,e,c,i} ‚Äã Œî i ‚Äã ‚àíC(A t ‚Äã ) where Œî ùëñ Œî i ‚Äã is the improvement in score ùëñ i due to action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã , and ùê∂ ( ùê¥ ùë° ) C(A t ‚Äã ) is the cost associated with taking action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã . The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward, which represents the startup's progress towards becoming a viable and successful business.

# Objective The objective remains to maximize the cumulative discounted reward over time, reflecting the long-term success of the startup: max ‚Å° [ ‚àë ùë°

0 ‚àû ùõæ ùë° ùëü ùë° ( ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° ) ] max[‚àë t=0 ‚àû ‚Äã Œ≥ t r t ‚Äã (s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã )]

This formulation captures the dynamic and uncertain nature of startup development, where strategic decisions must be made to navigate feasibility and desirability challenges while managing resources effectively.

what can be inferred about state transition from this analysis? formulate it as stochastic transition ChatGPT said: Given the analysis, we can infer a stochastic state transition model for the startup operational actions within a reinforcement learning framework. This model captures the probabilistic nature of how actions (A, T, G, C) influence the various feasibility and desirability tests' scores, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in startup development.

# State Space The state at time ùë° t is represented as a vector of the scores of operational feasibility test ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ), technology feasibility test ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ), employee's desirability test ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ), customer's desirability test ( ùëê ùë° c t ‚Äã ), and investor's desirability test ( ùëñ ùë° i t ‚Äã ), where each score is in the set { 0 , ‚Ä¶ , ùëÄ } {0,‚Ä¶,M}: ùë† ùë°

( ùëú ùë° , ùë° ùë° , ùëí ùë° , ùëê ùë° , ùëñ ùë° ) s t ‚Äã =(o t ‚Äã ,t t ‚Äã ,e t ‚Äã ,c t ‚Äã ,i t ‚Äã )

Action Space The action space consists of operational actions a startup might take: Atom supply/architecture (A), Technology/organization (T), Goal (G), Customer (C): ùê¥ ùë° ‚àà { ùê¥ , ùëá , ùê∫ , ùê∂ } A t ‚Äã ‚àà{A,T,G,C}

Stochastic State Transition The stochastic state transition reflects the uncertainty in how actions affect the scores. It can be modeled as a probability distribution over the next state, given the current state and action taken. For each action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã , there is a probability ùëÉ ( ùë† ùë° + 1 ‚à£ ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° ) P(s t+1 ‚Äã ‚à£s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã ) that represents the likelihood of moving to state ùë† ùë° + 1 s t+1 ‚Äã from state ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã after taking action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã .

For example, if action ùëá T is taken to improve technology feasibility ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ), the improvement is not deterministic but probabilistic, reflecting real-world uncertainties such as development challenges or unexpected breakthroughs.

Formulating Stochastic Transition The stochastic transition can be formulated as follows for each component of the state vector:

# For operational feasibility ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ) after action ùê¥ A: ùëÉ ( ùëú ùë° + 1 ‚à£ ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ )

# For technology feasibility ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ) after action ùëá T: ùëÉ ( ùë° ùë° + 1 ‚à£ ùë† ùë° , ùëá )

# For employee's desirability ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ) after action ùê∫ G: ùëÉ ( ùëí ùë° + 1 ‚à£ ùë† ùë° , ùê∫ )

# For investor's desirability ( ùëñ ùë° i t ‚Äã ) after any action, reflecting financial support or interest: ùëÉ ( ùëñ ùë° + 1 ‚à£ ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° )

# Prob ( ùëñ ùë° + 1 ‚àí ùëñ ùë°

Reward The reward function ùëü ùë° ( ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° ) r t ‚Äã (s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã ) captures the net benefit of taking action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã in state ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã , considering improvements in scores, costs, and potential revenues. It can be adjusted to reflect the stochastic outcomes of actions.

# Objective The objective remains to maximize the expected cumulative discounted reward, taking into account the stochastic nature of state transitions: max ‚Å° ùê∏ [ ‚àë ùë°

0 ‚àû ùõæ ùë° ùëü ùë° ( ùë† ùë° , ùê¥ ùë° ) ] maxE[‚àë t=0 ‚àû ‚Äã Œ≥ t r t ‚Äã (s t ‚Äã ,A t ‚Äã )]

This stochastic formulation acknowledges the uncertainties and variabilities in startup development, allowing for a more nuanced and realistic approach to modeling and decision-making in the entrepreneurial process.

You said: for simplicity, remove investor's desirability from the state and redo the latest formulation ChatGPT said: Removing the investor's desirability from the state simplifies the model to focus on operational feasibility, technology feasibility, employee's desirability, and customer's desirability. Here's the revised formulation without the investor's desirability component:

# State Space The state at time ùë° t is now represented as a vector of the scores for operational feasibility test ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ), technology feasibility test ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ), employee's desirability test ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ), and customer's desirability test ( ùëê ùë° c t ‚Äã ), where each score is in the set { 0 , ‚Ä¶ , ùëÄ } {0,‚Ä¶,M}: ùë† ùë°

This revised formulation focuses on the core aspects of startup development‚Äîoperational feasibility, technology development, employee engagement, and customer acquisition‚Äîwhile simplifying the model by excluding the direct consideration of investor desirability. This approach allows for a clearer focus on the startup's internal development and market interaction.

1 1 "Minimum Viable Product" Mike Judge Mike Judge & John Altschuler & Dave Krinsky April 6, 2014 1.98[7] Richard Hendricks is a low-level programmer with futuristic internet giant Hooli. He is often taunted by his more successful work colleagues, and his ideas are dismissed by egotistical entrepreneur Erlich Bachman, who owns the tech development incubator where Richard lives with fellow programmers Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti, Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai. However when Hooli stumbles upon the music copyright service that Richard is working on, entitled Pied Piper, they discover that hidden within the useless application is the best file compression algorithm in the world, and news spreads quickly. Eventually Richard is caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory; he must decide whether to give up his program to the highest bidder, or to take the investment and create a business out of it himself. After having a panic attack and vomiting, Richard runs into Peter's assistant Monica, who tells him that she believes in him and his idea. Richard decides to take the investment, and run the business himself. ChatGPT said: To infer ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã and ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã most effectively from the summary of the "Minimum Viable Product" episode of "Silicon Valley," we analyze the key elements of the episode that align with the state space and action space of our reinforcement learning (RL) model for startup development.

State Space ( ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã ) The state space ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã at this point in the narrative can be inferred based on the descriptions of operational feasibility, technology feasibility, employee's desirability, and customer's desirability:

Operational Feasibility ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ): Initially low, as Richard is working on Pied Piper mostly by himself within an incubator, without a clear business model or organizational structure.

Technology Feasibility ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ): High, given the discovery of the best file compression algorithm in the world within Pied Piper, indicating a significant technological innovation.

Employee's Desirability ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ): Medium, considering Richard has the support of his fellow programmers (Big Head, Gilfoyle, and Dinesh) but faces dismissal and taunting from others at Hooli and Erlich.

Customer's Desirability ( ùëê ùë° c t ‚Äã ): Initially unclear, but the interest from Hooli and the investment offer from Peter Gregory suggest a recognition of the potential market value of Pied Piper's technology.

Action Space ( ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã ) The actions taken by Richard in this episode align with the operational actions defined in our model:

A (Atom supply/architecture): Not explicitly mentioned, but the decision to take the investment and start building the business implies an initial step towards developing delivery capability and organizational structuring.

T (Technology/organization): The development and refinement of Pied Piper's compression algorithm represent a significant action in this space, enhancing the technology's feasibility.

G (Goal): Richard's decision to reject the buyout offer and instead take the investment to run the business himself is a clear action reflecting his entrepreneurial goal and belief in the product's potential.

C (Customer): While not directly acted upon in this summary, the underlying action is towards developing a market for Pied Piper by choosing to build a business around the technology rather than sell it off.

Inference From the episode summary, we can infer that ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã reflects a startup at an early stage with a high technology feasibility score, moderate employee's desirability, and an operational feasibility that is about to be enhanced by the founder's decisions. The action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã most effectively taken by Richard is a combination of T (focusing on technology development) and G (pursuing his entrepreneurial goals by deciding to build a business). This decision to take Peter Gregory's investment and reject the buyout offer marks a pivotal action that sets the direction for the startup's development, aiming to improve operational feasibility and eventually customer desirability.

2 2 "The Cap Table" Mike Judge Carson Mell April 13, 2014 1.69[8] After rejecting Belson's offer and siding with Peter Gregory, Richard is overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done in establishing the business to Gregory's satisfaction. Luckily, Belson's former PA, Jared Dunn, arrives at the incubator begging Richard to hire him, as he sees huge potential in the Pied Piper idea, and he is hired due to his business expertise. However, in evaluating the Pied Piper team, Jared discovers that while Gilfoyle and Dinesh are brilliant coders, Big Head is comparatively mediocre, and Richard is pressured by everyone to fire him as he brings nothing to the table. After much arguing, Richard refuses to do fire him, but Big Head announces that he was given a huge raise and promotion at Hooli, as Gavin Belson wants to publicize Big Head as co-founder of Pied Piper. Later, Big Head tells Richard that Hooli has begun reverse-engineering Pied Piper to create a similar product: Nucleus.

3 3 "Articles of Incorporation" Tricia Brock Matteo Borghese & Rob Turbovsky April 20, 2014 1.62[9] Richard and Jared discover that the Pied Piper business name is already in use by an irrigation company in Gilroy, California. While Jared, Dinesh and Gilfoyle begin brainstorming new names for the application, Erlich decides to find a new name for the company. He embarks on a vision quest in the Sonora Desert, but ends up having a panic attack after consuming too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. Adamant on keeping the original name, Richard attempts to prove that he is a good negotiator by convincing the irrigation company to give up the name Pied Piper. Initially the company's owner asks for $1000, but after reading about the technology's success on the web, he angrily demands a much larger sum. He ends up driving to Palo Alto to confront Richard, and after much arguing, Richard manages to keep the name for almost the original price. Erlich, still in the aftermath of his vision quest, returns with a child by his side, convinced he has found another version of himself. Meanwhile, Peter Gregory becomes obsessed with Burger King products, leaving his assistant Monica in a difficult position with one of their clients, who need an urgent cash injection or risk firing hundreds of people. Biding his time, Gregory ends up investing in sesame seed production, earning a huge profit in stock and solving the situation to Monica's and their associates' relief.

4 4 "Fiduciary Duties" Maggie Carey Ron Weiner April 27, 2014 1.55[10] Peter assigns an attorney, Ron LaFlamme, to the Pied Piper venture, who accidentally reveals that Richard's project is only one of eight file compression ventures that Peter has invested in. This impacts Richard, who suddenly panics that he has no sense of where the company should go and what it should be doing. Meanwhile, Big Head is removed from Hooli's copycat compression software project, named Nucleus, because of his utter lack of understanding of what Richard actually did to create Pied Piper. He is not reassigned to anything, and joins the other unassigned employees that spend their days biding their time on the company's roof. During a toga party organized by Gregory, Richard gets drunk and mistakenly appoints Erlich to the Pied Piper board of directors. Richard initially reverses the decision, but after Erlich elaborates during a meeting about Pied Piper's direction causing Peter to continue funding, Richard permanently appoints him on the board.

5 5 "Signaling Risk" Alec Berg Jessica Gao May 4, 2014 1.82[11] Erlich hires a convicted felon and graffiti artist, Chuy, to create a new logo for Pied Piper and to paint it on the incubator garage. However, Chuy's creation depicts Dinesh having sexual intercourse with the Statue of Liberty, because he believes Dinesh is Latino. Pied Piper gains entry to the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, a technology conference that pits unseeded startup companies against each other, with $50,000 as the grand prize. The only problem is, Pied Piper is not unseeded, and this angers Peter. Richard suggests withdrawing from the Battlefield, but Belson beats him to it and announces the release of Nucleus will take place at the Battlefield, and due to Peter's intense rivalry with Belson, he refuses to allow Pied Piper to withdraw. Peter tells the team to have a finished demo for the Battlefield in eight weeks, instead of the initial five months.

6 6 "Third Party Insourcing" Alec Berg Dan O'Keefe May 11, 2014 1.69[12] Pied Piper is nearing completion, but Richard is having serious issues coding the cloud-based integration modules for the application, so much so that Jared, Gilfoyle, Erlich and Dinesh pressure him into hiring Kevin "The Carver" (Austin Abrams), an Adderall-addicted teenage programmer who specializes in cloud integration. The Carver ends up accidentally destroying all of Pied Piper's code, forcing the team to stay up all night fixing his mistake. Meanwhile, Gilfoyle's long-distance girlfriend, Tara (Milana Vayntrub), visits the incubator. Gilfoyle wrongfully tells Dinesh that Tara wants to have sex with him, and that this prospect sexually arouses both Tara and Gilfoyle. Jared gets stranded on Peter's automated island due to a programming error.

7 7 "Proof of Concept" Mike Judge Clay Tarver May 18, 2014 1.68[13] The team arrives at the Battlefield. However, Pied Piper still isn't finished, and Richard is having trouble concentrating due to the presence of an ex-girlfriend at the conference; after much drama, the situation is eventually resolved. Dinesh meets an attractive girl, Charlotte (AJ Michalka), who appears to be proficient in Java, but when Gilfoyle tells him that the Java code was in fact written by him, Dinesh loses interest in Charlotte. Erlich panics when it transpires that one of the judges of the Battlefield is the man whose wife he had an affair with years earlier, and in an attempt to remedy the situation, Erlich ends up having sex with the judge's new wife, which results in the judge attacking Erlich on stage, preventing the Pied Piper Battlefield presentation.

8 8 "Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency" Mike Judge Alec Berg June 1, 2014 1.74[14] Desperate to avoid litigation after the brawl, TechCrunch offers Pied Piper a ticket straight to the final Battlefield stage, but the team is despondent after watching Hooli's presentation. Not only is Nucleus' Weissman compression quality score 2.89‚Äîthe exact same as theirs‚Äîbut it also has a number of additional features which makes it a much better application than Pied Piper. Jared suggests pivoting the company, which results in him being arrested by the police after an incident involving Adderall. The PP team retreats to their hotel room where they mock up a mathematical model for Erlich to give handjobs to every male in the Battlefield audience instead of doing their presentation. The discussion gives Richard an epiphany about compression algorithms, and he stays up all night to code. He deletes most of the Pied Piper features and leaves only one ‚Äì the all-important compression engine, which, using Richard's brand new compression code, achieves a Weissman score of 5.2. Pied Piper wins the Battlefield, embarrassing Belson and Hooli. After learning from Monica, amidst some flirting between the two, that Pied Piper will be fielding business interests and that things will only get harder, Richard has another panic attack and vomits into a dumpster in the alley.

Season 2 (2015) Main article(s): Silicon Valley (season 2) No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by Original air date U.S. viewers (millions) 9 1 "Sand Hill Shuffle" Mike Judge Clay Tarver April 12, 2015 2.13[15] Pied Piper learns of Peter Gregory's death and question Raviga Capital's viability for their Series A funding. Bachman and Richard pitch Pied Piper to numerous venture capitalists who are trying to woo them, and find that being rude leads to better reception. Meanwhile, Raviga's partners select Laurie Bream as their new managing partner, whose eccentricity resembles Gregory's. Monica learns that Pied Piper is the firm's only hope for survival. Firms deliver their term sheets and as Erlich makes a selection, Bream and Monica deliver a better offer: $20 million at a $100 million valuation. Monica later warns Richard against taking a high amount, as they will be unable to secure further funding without increasing their valuation. At Gregory's funeral, Richard chooses Raviga for a $10 million investment at a $50 million valuation, surprising Bream who accepts. The funeral is attended by many, including the founders of Snapchat and Gavin Belson. As Belson speaks about his relationship with Gregory, Richard receives a message informing him that Hooli is suing Pied Piper for intellectual property theft.

10 2 "Runaway Devaluation" Mike Judge Ron Weiner April 19, 2015 1.73[16] With the threat of Hooli's lawsuit, Laurie Bream decides to drop Pied Piper from Raviga Capital's portfolio. Richard and Erlich meet with the other venture capitalists, who are no longer interested due to the lawsuit and their earlier behavior. Meanwhile, Dinesh meets with his cousin Wajeed who is crowdfunding an app called Bro, which is similar to Yo but instead sends the word "bro". After hosting a crowdfunding party and a $500 donation from Gilfoyle meant to irritate Dinesh, Wajeed meets his goal of $50,000. Jared finds a venture capitalist on the Bro app, but when they meet it turns out to be a "brain rape" scam to steal their algorithm, causing Erlich and Jared to quickly end the presentation. With no options left but to hire a "cheap" lawyer for $2.5 million, Gavin Belson calls Richard and asks to meet him privately. At a bar, Belson proposes Hooli acquiring Pied Piper and bringing Richard back into the Hooli team, noting that Richard is currently forming the exact type of "soulless" corporation he despises. As Richard begins to respond, a mariachi band interrupts them, and the episode ends.

11 3 "Bad Money" Alec Berg Alec Berg April 26, 2015 1.94[17] Though his colleagues disapprove, Richard reluctantly agrees to take Monica's advice and let Hooli acquire Pied Piper. However, Russ Hanneman, a flashy billionaire who made his money by putting radio on the Internet (a parody of Mark Cuban), offers Richard $5 million for equity in Pied Piper and two seats on its board. Monica warns Richard that Hooli is the safer option and that Hanneman is a terrible person, but Richard ignores her. Monica informs Bream who expresses disgust at the idea of being associated with Hanneman. Now funded, Pied Piper begins creating a budget for the next 18 months, and negotiating how many new people they will hire. Hanneman arrives and disrupts the budget meeting by talking loudly on the phone and hanging out with his friend Cory. Erlich tries to befriend Hanneman but fails. Hanneman tells Pied Piper that revenue is a bad thing, that the check he gave them is just a "show check", and buys several Pied Piper billboards without asking. Meanwhile, Belson compares the treatment of billionaires to the suffering of Jews in the Holocaust during an interview, manages the backlash, and gets his lawyers to figure out how to improve his case for suing Pied Piper.

12 4 "The Lady" Alec Berg Carson Mell May 3, 2015 1.75[18] Pied Piper interviews new coders Jared Patakian, who identifies as a cyborg, and Carla Walton, a friend of Dinesh and Gilfoyle. With the introduction of Patakian, Jared Dunn is called "Other Jared", shortened to "OJ". OJ hires Carla and begins enforcing company human-resources policies. Erlich discourages Richard from hiring Patakian who had earlier spurned a job at Aviato, while Carla tortures Gilfoyle and Dinesh by suggesting that she makes more money than them. Pied Piper has a board meeting at Hanneman's house, and Bachman sides against Richard to order $30,000 in promotional merchandise from Hanneman's other companies. Later, Richard decides to hire Patakian despite Erlich's disapproval, but quickly discovers that Patakian had only entertained their job offer to get a better offer from another company. Meanwhile, to improve his lawsuit, Belson promotes Big Head to be Co-head Dreamer on the Hooli XYZ project to make him appear to have been the driving force behind Pied Piper. Big Head is given a massive office and an assistant, but suspiciously no responsibilities, while Davis Bannercheck, a pioneer of robotics, is named the other Co-head Dreamer and leads operations at the lab.

13 5 "Server Space" Mike Judge Sonny Lee May 10, 2015 1.53[19] Richard is suffering from night sweats, a result of stress that could lead to bedwetting. He searches for office space, to separate work and life and accommodate for growth. The team tours an office neighboring a modeling agency, leading Dinesh to suggest leasing it. Richard asks the team to begin setting up servers, but Pied Piper has been blacklisted from major hosting providers due to pressure from Hooli. Gilfoyle notes that the providers would eventually be unable to meet their needs and suggests building their own servers, requiring the money for the office lease, so the team stay in Erlich's house. The parts delivery draws suspicions from neighbor Noah, who threatens to report their zoning violation after a mistake by Dinesh temporarily cuts power to the neighborhood. He backs down after Bachman and Richard discover he is illegally keeping ferrets and leases his guest house to Jared. Meanwhile, Belson is more concerned with grudges than innovation at Hooli XYZ, blatantly ignoring Bannercheck's concerns about Big Head's progress. Bannercheck resigns and Big Head becomes the sole Head Dreamer of Hooli XYZ.

14 6 "Homicide" Mike Judge Carrie Kemper May 17, 2015 1.54[20] Hooli launches Nucleus by using it to broadcast a major mixed martial arts (UFC) event. The demo fails miserably. Pied Piper use the opportunity to show off their technology by partnering with Homicide energy drink, owned by a former classmate of Erlich's, and broadcasting a publicity stunt. Dinesh and Gilfoyle notice that Blaine, the stunt driver, has miscalculated his ramp speed and will likely be killed attempting the stunt. Blaine arrogantly refuses to listen to their concerns. Belson, caught short by the Nucleus failure, worries that he has surrounded himself with sycophants who only tell him what he wants to hear. Gilfoyle and Dinesh debate the morality of letting Blaine kill himself performing the stunt. Later, Blaine comes in to apologize and sees the SWOT analysis they performed posted on the wall, becoming highly offended. Richard discovers that Homicide omitted the Pied Piper logo from the broadcast and the partnership falls apart. Already set up, Richard agrees to broadcast a live stream of a condor egg. The Homicide stunt is broadcast with the logo of End Frame, the rival company that tricked the group into revealing their algorithm.

15 7 "Adult Content" Alec Berg Amy Aniobi May 24, 2015 1.60[21] The team from Pied Piper storms into the offices of End Frame to accuse them of stealing the Pied Piper algorithm. End Frame responds that since they have a finished platform and a sales team, that ultimately they will beat Pied Piper. Gavin Belson holds a board meeting to discuss the failure of the launch of their Nucleus product. He then meets with the engineers and begs them to come up with something new and radical. Russ Hanneman informs Richard and Erlich that due to bad investments he is no longer a billionaire and now Pied Piper must come up with a way to become profitable. Gilfoyle obtains the details of End Frame's service contract with Intersite, a porn company. Richard meets the CEO of Intersite at a conference and convinces her to consider Pied Piper for the contract. Big Head meets with Belson to explain some exciting new technology, but adds that it will not be available until their grandchildren's time. The episode ends with Pied Piper and End Frame being brought to Intersite offices for a "bake off" to determine who will get the contract.

Belson realizes that he may need a scapegoat, and convinces Bannercheck to return to Hooli and head Nucleus. However, he quits as soon as he assesses the project. Richard learns that Seth Lee, End Frame's network security engineer, was fired, presumably over Gilfoyle breaching their security. Feeling guilty, Richard tries to console Seth, who threatens to hack Pied Piper for revenge. Richard is worried and Dinesh warns that Richard has admitted to being a "black hat" and needs to be careful. Richard makes peace with Seth, but when he says Gilfoyle was unconcerned Seth feels insulted and renews his threats. Pied Piper begins transferring data from Intersite for the bake-off. Hanneman arrives to celebrate and stressed Richard becomes angry at his interruption and shouts at him. Intersite's CTO frantically informs them that Pied Piper is deleting all of their data. They wrongly conclude that Seth is behind the fork bomb though Gilfoyle cannot figure out how; eventually they find that Hanneman had put a tequila bottle down on the delete key of a laptop. Intersite angrily dismiss Pied Piper.

17 9 "Binding Arbitration" Mike Judge Dan O'Keefe June 7, 2015 1.87[23] Big Head finds a prototype Nucleus phone left by the "brogrammers" and, stunned at how bad it is, provides it to Richard for helping him advance at Hooli. To prevent the press from learning about the phone, Belson drops the lawsuit in favor of binding arbitration. Pied Piper are represented by Pete Monahan, who works cheap as he was disbarred due to suspected sex crimes. During discovery, Monahan learns that Richard had used a Hooli computer to run a single test of Pied Piper, and by his employment contract Hooli thus owns the rights to Pied Piper. Hooli's lawyers try to build up Big Head as the modest genius who invented Pied Piper. However, a slip by Bachman leads Hooli to realize that the "girlfriend" Richard had "dropped off at the Apple store" was actually his laptop. Hooli calls Richard as a witness, and he admits that he used a Hooli computer. Meanwhile, the museum providing the video of the condor egg decides to remove the camera due to low viewership, but the technician taking it down falls and becomes trapped with the camera in a ravine. Viewership of the feed spikes while the team awaits the results of the arbitration.

18 10 "Two Days of the Condor" Alec Berg Alec Berg June 14, 2015 2.11[24] Belson reveals that he would've paid $250 million for Pied Piper. Erlich questions the value of his incubator and considers selling until he learns the house would be demolished. The video feed of the injured technician goes viral, forcing Gilfoyle, Dinesh, Jared and Erlich to scramble; despite a fire and other setbacks, they keep the feed online until the technician is rescued. The arbitration judge rules that per Richard's employment contract Hooli would own Pied Piper's intellectual property. Richard then instructs the team to delete Pied Piper's code before Hooli can seize it. However, the judge continues that Hooli's claim is nullified by an illegal non-compete clause and Richard, whose phone runs out of battery, races to the incubator to prevent the deletion. He arrives too late but the deletion program crashes before any damage is done. Word spreads at Hooli, where over half of the employee contracts are invalid. Belson is called to meet with Hooli's board of directors. Big Head's promotions lead Denpok to begin mentoring him. Meanwhile, Raviga buys out Hanneman's stake in Pied Piper, making him a billionaire again, and securing three of five board seats. Raviga then removes Richard as CEO of Pied Piper.

Season 3 (2016) 19 1 "Founder Friendly" Mike Judge Dan O'Keefe April 24, 2016 1.86[25] After failing to convince the board of directors to keep him on as Pied Piper CEO instead of demoting him to Chief Technology Officer, Richard threatens to quit and sue to regain his intellectual property. Richard meets with a company called Flutterbeam that wants to hire him as CTO. However, disappointed at how banal the project assigned to him would be, he rejects the offer and decides to stay with Pied Piper. Afterwards, Richard meets with Jack Barker, Raviga's choice for the CEO of Pied Piper. Meanwhile, at Hooli, Belson discovers that the now invalid employment contracts would allow him to fire affected employees without severance and take back unvested stock options. Belson fires the entire Nucleus team, and uses the profits from the reclaimed stock options to offer Big Head a $20 million severance package in exchange for non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements.

20 2 "Two in the Box" Mike Judge Ron Weiner May 1, 2016 1.72[26] Richard meets with the sales team at Pied Piper and realizes that plans for the platform are business-facing instead of consumer-facing. Referring to his experience of the Dot-com bubble, Jack explains to Richard that they need to make profit fast, and promises that he would never compromise the product, later explaining that by "product" he means the company's stock value. Richard tells the sales team what he wants the platform to be, but they want to remove Richard's features so it will be easier to sell to businesses. Later, the sales team show Richard a commercial for the product, and it's exactly what Richard does not want it to be. Meanwhile, Jared plans to move back into his condo, but the tenant refuses to leave or pay rent; as Erlich explains how difficult it is to evict a tenant, Jian-Yang decides not to accept the end of his own lease. At Hooli, Belson suggests to the engineers to alter the company's search algorithm so it doesn't display any negative stories about Nucleus, Hooli or himself. The Nucleus team crack the middle-out compression shortly before their contracts expire, and decide to take this knowledge with them.

Appalled by this prospect, Richard continues to push for a platform instead of the box appliance, but Jack refuses. Gilfoyle quits and begins to receive several job offers and gifts from recruiters. In an attempt to have Jack's decision reverted, Richard meets with Laurie who agrees with Richard's vision but is reluctant to fire a recently appointed senior CEO. In one of his job interviews, Gilfoyle learns that Endframe has hired two of the coders from Hooli, who cracked Richard's middle-out algorithm. Gilfoyle reports this to Pied Piper and they decide on a Skunkworks project: to secretly pursue the original vision for Pied Piper alongside working on the box appliance, seemingly complying with Jack's order. Jared refers to Meinertzhagen's Haversack, cautioning everyone to act inconspicuously, and to destroy all traces of their conspiracy. However, upon entering their office space the next morning, Richard trips, and incriminating documents which he had meant to shred are spread all over the floor and brought to Jack's attention.

22 4 "Maleant Data Systems Solutions" Charlie McDowell Donick Cary May 15, 2016 1.89[28] Jack threatens to fire the team for developing the platform, but needs them to deliver a prototype box to Maleant. The team agrees to create a basic functioning box, after which they can create the platform. However, the team are unable to deliver a lesser product and their box exceeds all competitors. Meanwhile, Erlich searches for a new incubator prospect and discovers that Big Head has a nine-bedroom mansion where he hosts tenants for a share of their startups. Erlich talks Big Head into a partnership. In a board meeting on Maleant's box deal, Monica notices that it includes exclusive rights which would prevent launching the platform for five years. Laurie backs Jack's deal as the platform does not have proven value, but Monica votes against the deal and delays it. Belson later phones Richard, gloating that he acquired Endframe's middle-out compression platform for $250 million. However, by setting a price point on middle-out compression, Belson valued Pied Piper's platform well above the Maleant deal, and the team gain Laurie's backing. She fires Jack for undermining her and leaves the CEO position open, giving the team approval to work on the platform.

23 5 "The Empty Chair" Eric Appel Megan Amram May 22, 2016 1.71[29] Jack spent almost all of Pied Piper's funding, and they won't get another installment until delivering the finished platform. They close the office, fire employees, and return to Erlich's incubator. Erlich drafts a partnership agreement for Bachmanity, which gives him control of Big Head's assets while retaining his Pied Piper shares. Richard confronts Laurie about a negative article on tech blog Code/Rag; Laurie agrees that he should speak with its author, C.J. Cantwell, after meeting with Raviga's PR head. However, Richard rants about Laurie to Cantwell, mistaking her for the PR head. She will only kill the story if he brings her a better one, which he gets from Big Head: how Belson secretly ordered his engineers to scrub Hooli's negative publicity from the Internet. Laurie confides to Monica that she was wrong to remove Richard as CEO and plans to reinstate him after going through the motions of a search so that the decision is perceived as being well considered. Richard is reappointed CEO. The team hires an engineering team of outsourced coders working remotely from around the world, at a fraction of the local cost.

24 6 "Bachmanity Insanity" Eric Appel Carson Mell May 29, 2016 1.62[30] Belson faces public backlash from the Code/Rag story and demands Cantwell reveal her source, threatening legal action. Erlich throws a lavish Hawaiian-themed party at Alcatraz to launch Bachmanity while Big Head is concerned of losing his Hooli severance money for violation of his non-disclosure agreement. Erlich says he'll fix it, and buys Code/Rag for $500,000, while Big Head's business manager Arthur Clayman warns that he risks going bankrupt. Meanwhile, Richard starts dating Winnie, a coder for Facebook. Gilfoyle and Dinesh notice that Winnie uses spaces instead of tabs for coding, a technique which, they tell her, Richard despises. When she reveals this to him, Richard falsely denies it and turns the relationship sour. Dinesh flirts via video chat with Elisabet, one of Pied Piper's outsourced coders who lives in Estonia, but when he finally reveals himself she mentions her "boyfriend", while Gilfoyle mocks him. During the party, which Erlich dubbed "Bachmanity Insanity", Sasha, the party manager, tells Bachman that the supplier's checks have bounced. Right before the big speech, Clayman informs him that Bachmanity has gone broke.

25 7 "To Build a Better Beta" Jamie Babbit John Levenstein June 5, 2016 1.70[31] Erlich and Big Head's firm, Bachmanity, is unable to pay its creditors following its million-dollar luau. Pied Piper anticipates an early launch following good rapport from their selective beta launch. One of the beta testers is revealed to be a Hooli spy when Gilfoyle adds a "God view" allowing them to pinpoint users' geographic locations. Erlich and Big Head discover that Big Head's former business manager embezzled $6 million. Erlich considers selling some of his Pied Piper shares to Laurie to settle the debts. Gilfoyle sends a compressed virus that destroys Belson's phone and laptop, and he shuts down power to the Hooli campus in fear of further damage. The principal (recently re-hired) developers of Nucleus resign, leaving the Hooli rebuild of Nucleus in a hiatus state. Gilfoyle decommissions "Anton", his server, while getting flak from Dinesh about his best friend being a piece of hardware. After a meeting with Laurie, Erlich gets a call about his debts being erased. Richard and team count the seconds down to the official public launch of the Pied Piper platform.

26 8 "Bachman's Earnings Over-Ride" Jamie Babbit Carrie Kemper June 12, 2016 1.64[32] Pied Piper reaches 100,000 downloads in just 10 days, receiving significant media coverage and being hailed as the next unicorn of the tech world. Bachman conceals the fact that he sold his 10% share in Pied Piper, an insider stock dump that could signal uncertainty. Richard prepares a press release explaining Bachman's financial woes but Bachman protects Pied Piper with a sacrificial interview to Code/Rag. Bachman was poised to sell half his stock to Hanneman for $5 million but Laurie used her board majority to approve only a sale to herself of all of his stock for $713,000, just enough to cover his debts. Feeling responsible, Hendricks offers Bachman a job as Pied Piper's head of PR. Meanwhile, Belson is transitioned from CEO for spending three quarters of a billion dollars on Nucleus and Endframe with nothing to show for it, and Hooli begins carrying the Pied Piper app on the Hooli Store.

27 9 "Daily Active Users" Alec Berg Clay Tarver June 19, 2016 1.63[33] Laurie hosts a cocktail party to celebrate 500,000 downloads of Pied Piper's platform. Richard reveals to Monica that the number of daily active users (DAU) is actually very poor, something that only he and Jared know. Realizing that their beta version was only reviewed by fellow engineers and tech-savvy users, Richard proposes introducing a series of seminars and tutorials about how to use the platform, which, ironically, is too advanced for regular users. Confronted with this, all of Pied Piper's recently employed staff quits, including a customer service rep who heads for an interview at Hooli. Sensing an opportunity, Belson interviews him and learns about Pied Piper's low number of DAUs. Later, he summons the board to announce that his intention was never to develop a platform, introducing Jack Barker as Hooli Endframe's new director and their new product: a box just like the one Barker planned for Pied Piper. The board reinstates Belson as CEO. Facing Pied Piper's apparent downfall, Richard tells Jared that he will dissolve the company. The following morning, however, the number of DAUs has risen sharply. Jared secretly paid for a click farm in Bangladesh to provide DAUs to the platform.

28 10 "The Uptick" Alec Berg Alec Berg June 26, 2016 2.04[34] Belson uses an elephant at a Hooli board meeting and it dies on campus. He fires his assistant Patrice for opposing its secretive disposal, and she contacts Cantwell for an expos√©. Richard learns of Jared's click farm operation, which Dinesh and Gilfoyle made undetectable. Erlich promotes Pied Piper and attracts a significant investment from venture capitalists Coleman Blair Partners. Jared discourages Richard from signing a deal based on fraudulent data, which Richard reveals to Erlich and Coleman Blair. Erlich is furious that Pied Piper has lost credibility to investors. Due to the scandal, Raviga offers its interest for sale to the highest bidder. Belson offers $1 million to buy it and extinguish the company. He also buys Code/Rag for $2 million in order to quash the elephant story. Monica, having been fired from Raviga for opposing Laurie, joins the team, which ultimately realizes that their video chat app, a side project by Dinesh, is considerably better than Hooli's. Big Head and Erlich, who owned half of Code/Rag through their partnership firm Bachmanity, use the money from the buyout to beat Gavin Belson's offer by one dollar, thus becoming the new owners of Pied Piper.

Season 4 (2017) Main article(s): Silicon Valley (season 4) No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by Original air date U.S. viewers (millions) 29 1 "Success Failure" Mike Judge Alec Berg April 23, 2017 0.867[35] Pied Piper officially pivots to PiperChat, a video chat app created by Dinesh, which is steadily gaining users and is superior to all competitors. However, the team is unable to gain funding due to the scandal of their click farm upticks and demise of the compression platform. After clashing with Dinesh and Gilfoyle over the development of the app and attempting to gain investment from Hanneman, Richard realizes that he can't be the CEO of a project he doesn't believe in. Just as the team prepares to replace him with Big Head, he quits his position and signs over his equity in exchange for use of his algorithm and the Pied Piper brand in the pursuit of a more ambitious goal: a decentralized internet based on users and smartphones instead of large companies and mainframes. He suggests Dinesh become the CEO of PiperChat, which was his creation. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson and Jack Barker are returning from China after closing a deal to manufacture Hooli Endframe's box. Belson becomes irked that Jack diverts the plane for his own convenience while lying about it, and "promotes" Jack by assigning him a position at a desk in Hooli's data center, deep underground.

30 2 "Terms of Service" Mike Judge Clay Tarver April 30, 2017 0.762[36] PiperChat gathers attention from investors and a steady stream of daily active users (DAUs), while Richard keeps working on his "new internet" project. Richard finds that Dinesh has blocked him from PiperChat's data repository, violating a verbal agreement. After Big Head gives him login access, Richard learns that a third of PiperChat's users are children, and the app's terms of service never included parental permission. This violates the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and can incur a total penalty of $21 billion. Meanwhile, Barker embraces his demotion to the data center underground, but Belson is suspicious and spies on his video chat sessions. Since Barker uses PiperChat, with unbreakable encryption, Belson determines to acquire the company. He accuses Dinesh of stealing Hooli Chat's tech and threatens lawsuits, demanding he sign over the company ‚Äì without a legal assessment. Dinesh does so, having decided to shut it down. Meanwhile, Erlich learns that Jian-Yang has investment meetings and makes a deal with him for 10% of his company; later, he finds out the app is not about Oculus VR but about recipes to cook octopus.

31 3 "Intellectual Property" Jamie Babbit Carrie Kemper May 7, 2017 0.774[37] Gavin Belson is fired following the disastrous acquisition of PiperChat. He is replaced by Jack Barker, who has found a way to avoid the COPPA fines. During Jian-Yang's pitch, Erlich convinces venture capitalists that Jian-Yang's app is actually a "Shazam for food". He hires Dinesh to help write a demo. Monica tricks Raviga's new rising star, Ed Chen, into making a sight-unseen offer for the app, but Chen quickly finds out that there is no product after speaking to Jian-Yang. As revenge, Chen has Monica put in charge of the investment. Big Head applies to Stanford University; he is rejected for enrollment, but the admissions officer invites him to be a guest lecturer based on his name recognition and executive experience. Meanwhile, Richard learns from Monica that Peter Gregory thought of a decentralized Internet in the 1990s, and gains access to his archives. He finds Gregory came to the same conclusions, but the compression wasn't good enough back then. Richard then realizes that this is the best manifestation for his compression algorithm. However, Richard discovers that the new Internet idea was patented by Gavin Belson when he was founding Hooli with Gregory and others.

32 4 "Teambuilding Exercise" Jamie Babbit Meghan Pleticha May 14, 2017 0.859[38] Gavin is reluctant to build Richard's idea, but agrees in order to get revenge on Hooli. Knowing his team would never work for Gavin, Richard assembles outside coders to build the platform, but adds Gilfoyle and Jared, who admit they want to be on the team. Jian-Yang tests his SeeFood app, but it only recognizes if something is a hot dog or not. Angry and dissatisfied with the work, he refuses to add more foods to the app. Erlich angrily snaps a picture of his penis, which the app recognizes as a hot dog. Jian-Yang spends all the initial funding on a Corvette. Erlich convinces Big Head to make his students train the image recognition neural net as an assignment. Immediately understanding Erlich's motive, they meet with Coleman Blair Partners and create their own food-based app instead, beating SeeFood to market. Considering his shares of Jian-Yang's app worthless, Erlich trades them for Jian-Yang's Corvette. However, Jian-Yang manages to use Erlich's penis picture to pivot the project as a filter for "dick pics" and Periscope acquires the app. Dinesh is brought into Periscope where his main duty is scrubbing pictures of penises from the Internet, for which he is mocked by Gilfoyle.

33 5 "The Blood Boy" Tim Roche Adam Countee May 21, 2017 0.844[39] Richard presents the business plan for the decentralized internet project, wanting a discreet launch beginning with a free compression app which will accumulate decentralized storage space on users' devices. Bryce, a jock who regularly donates blood to Belson, influences Belson to rethink the strategy. Richard and Jared warn Bryce not to interfere with their company. Belson demands that Richard apologizes, and he visits Bryce, eventually discovering that he actually consumes marijuana and sugary snacks and is not as healthy as Belson believes. Meanwhile, Erlich predicts that Ed Chen is planning to force Laurie out of Raviga. When Monica tries to warn her, Laurie says she knew about it and rewards Monica's loyalty with an invitation to be her partner on a new VC firm, as she had planned to exit Raviga with a number of investors. Dinesh is paranoid about Mia and doesn't have the courage to break up with her, so turns her in to the FBI for hacking access to the elevators at the Freedom Tower in New York City. Bryce gets a deal for a tell-all book about Belson who decides to leave Palo Alto, leaving Richard with ownership of the decentralized internet patent but no funding.

34 6 "Customer Service" Clay Tarver Graham Wagner & Shawn Boxe May 28, 2017 0.728[40] After a disturbing encounter with Hanneman, who urinates into Erlich's Corvette, Richard abandons searching for investors and tries to pre-sell cloud storage from their projected service. After several meetings fail because Belson left, they extort an insurance company FGI's CTO, Dan Melcher, the former TechCrunch judge Bachman twice cuckolded, to approve them. However, reviewing the tech late into the night, Hendricks ends up having sex with Melcher's new fianc√©e. Meanwhile, testing a prototype app, Dinesh and Gilfoyle's personal data is swapped onto each other's phones, leading to a tense standoff. While trying to prove he is still relevant, Erlich inadvertently crashes a meeting with Keenan Feldspar, an up-and-coming VR wiz, and brings him to Laurie and Monica's new firm, Bream-Hall, as leverage to get a job.

35 7 "The Patent Troll" Jamie Babbit Andrew Law June 4, 2017 0.862[41] Pied Piper's space saver app reaches the top 500 utility apps on the Hooli store. This makes them a target for elderly lawyer Stewart Burke who lives off royalties; he bought patents from a failed startup and is working his way up the list seeking settlements. Feeling they are being shaken-down, Richard rallies the next targets on the list to join together, but they turn on him and, with a stronger case from those settlements, Burke raises his demand from $20,000 to $300,000. Hendricks turns the tables by threatening Burke's copyright claims to gain a perpetual license. Bachman returns half of his finder's-fee for Feldspar for a salaried position at Bream-Hall. To network with his rivals, he accepts an invitation to a basketball game not realizing he is expected to play; he breaks his leg while trying to install a practice hoop. Gilfoyle uses Anton to hack Jian-Yang's annoying smart fridge.

36 8 "The Keenan Vortex" Jamie Babbit Graham Wagner & Rachele Lynn June 11, 2017 0.798[42] Keenan Feldspar put a rider in his contract so he can leave Bream-Hall if Erlich does. Due to a cold snap and consequent insurance claims, FGI has unexpected data processing requirements and the team faces a huge bill from their storage provider. Needing another client, they pitch to Feldspar. Dinesh and Gilfoyle are sucked into his VR project which they improve with middle-out compression. Feldspar offers to acquire Pied Piper; Richard tries to bluff with a valuation of $25 million, which Keenan accepts. Feldspar gets the money by pitching his improved VR to another firm, receiving triple Bream-Hall's advance, and convincing Erlich to quit. Monica warns Richard that Feldspar's VR tech is a bloated demo that can never be fully realized, which he is hyping for quick money. She promises to fund their series A round if they can implement the decentralized internet project on a sufficient number of smartphones. Feldspar sells his company to Hooli, the only other company with middle-out compression, as Barker's box2 faced setbacks and he desperately needs something to showcase at the upcoming Hooli-Con tech conference. Erlich is left out of the Hooli deal with nothing to show for it.

37 9 "Hooli-Con" Mike Judge Chris Provenzano June 18, 2017 0.840[43] Needing 123,000 new users, the team head to Hooli-Con, following Mia's advice to disguise their app as a Hooli download for free Wi-Fi at the event. Dinesh and Gilfoyle strategically place routers for maximum interception coverage; Hoover, Hooli's head of security, is suspicious and warns Barker who rebukes him for the distraction. Richard sabotages the screen saver of Winnie's new boyfriend, who reports it and triggers a response team which discovers some of the routers. The Pied Piper team attempt a workaround but are caught, and Jared is outraged at Richard for risking everything on something so petty. Hoover confronts them with CCTV evidence but lets them go as Richard once helped Belson hinder Barker's plans at Hooli. Pied Piper gains sufficient installs. However, Barker and Feldspar's keynote is a mobile demo of HooliVR, which causes a number of phones in the auditorium to explode. Meanwhile, Erlich deciding that he and Richard are forever cursed, decides to move to Tibet on Gavin Belson's invitation. When he gets there, Gavin is far from happy to see him.

38 10 "Server Error" Mike Judge Dan O'Keefe June 25, 2017 0.790[44] Gilfoyle confirms that fifty exploded phones had Pied Piper's app. Instead of a firmware update, Barker intends to replace 9 million smartphones in three days, at great expense. He tries to triple production with a motivational speech in China and is taken hostage by factory workers. Belson finds out and decides leave Tibet and go to China to try to get his company back. He invites Erlich, but Erlich is lazy and wants to smoke opium in his den. Gavin then gives his innkeeper enough money to house Erlich for five years and leaves Erlich in the Tibet den. Belson negotiates Barker's release, regaining the board's trust and his position as CEO. Meanwhile, during an attempt to move Pied Piper's network to their server, Anton, the incubator's broadband is cut for unpaid bills. Richard tries to move Anton to Stanford, but the server components fall out of the truck en route. They are surprised to find their network is still running all of FGI's data. Anton backed itself up to Jian-Yang's smart refrigerator, which Gilfoyle hacked with Pied Piper's code, and the code spread to other refrigerators creating a distributed network and proving their concept. Pied Piper agrees to funding from Bream-Hall.

Season 5 (2018) Main article(s): Silicon Valley (season 5) No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by Original air date U.S. viewers (millions) 39 1 "Grow Fast or Die Slow" Mike Judge Ron Weiner March 25, 2018 0.698[45] Dinesh and Gilfoyle procrastinate on new hires, and Belson hires all 63 distributed-systems developers in the valley. The developers and a milestone award make Belson feel ancient, though his Box2 is poised to become a huge money-maker. Jared suggests acquiring failing startup Optimoji to raid its staff but its CEO, Kira, insists they retain all 30 staff. Richard almost manages to get her to concede on this, but Duncan, CEO of pizza-ordering app Sliceline, encounters them and reveals Belson's plot, alerting Kira to the fact that Richard is desperate, giving her more leverage. Pied Piper decide to hire all of Optimoji's staff, but Duncan has already acquired them for Sliceline, infuriating Richard. Realizing that Sliceline is operating at a loss while optimizing their code, Richard spends $19,000 of company money on pizzas to exhaust their funding and absorbs both failed startups, gaining a staff of fifty (minus Duncan or Kira, whom he relishes in firing). Trusting Monica's judgement, Laurie approves of this though it is way over Pied Piper's payroll budget. Also, Jian-Yang claims that Erlich is dead and tries to gain control of his assets.

40 2 "Reorientation" Mike Judge Carson Mell April 1, 2018 0.592[46] Richard has trouble leading Pied Piper's new team of coders, who he is unable to address without panicking and embarrassing himself. Divided into Sliceline and Optimoji camps, he tries to cater to each side which results in chaos. He invites them to leave if they can't be inspired by the work they're doing, and they walk out. Richard then takes on the coding himself, completing 4 days of scheduled work in a 48-hour coding session. The programmers return to watch him and come to respect him as a coder. Meanwhile, Dinesh and Gilfoyle clash over a premium electric-only parking space when Dinesh takes delivery of his new Tesla Model S. Jian-Yang uses forged documents to become approved as Bachman's chief executor and sole beneficiary, and evicts the others from the house. Meanwhile, Gavin attempts to make the Box 3 more appealing by adding his signature to a limited number of the devices. However, a handwriting analyst concludes that his signature is indicative of sociopathy. Gavin attempts to crowdsource a signature from Hooli's employees, and they overwhelmingly vote for one that looks exactly like a penis, which Gavin doesn't seem to notice.

However, Richard is more taken with Ben Burkhart, Quiver's COO who promotes himself for that position with Pied Piper. Jared warns Richard of Ben's unprofessional exits from other companies. After overspending on his electric car, Dinesh rents a room from Jeff Washburn, Hoover's spy at Pied Piper, and reveals the fridge hack. Belson gives Seppen, the refrigerator company, an excellent deal on server space if they will sue Pied Piper for $10 million in damages for the hack which had put a video of a mime simulating fellatio on their fridge network. Ben advises Richard to put sole blame on Gilfoyle, although his actions subsequently saved Pied Piper from bankruptcy. Assuming that Richard will hire him, Ben lies to Dana to facilitate his exit from Quiver. Gilfoyle learns that Seppen is illegally listening to their customer's conversations and uploading them to the cloud. Using this information, Jared gets Seppen to drop the charges and use Pied Piper's storage services, and Richard makes Jared his COO. The Seppen executives reveal that it was Belson's idea to sue, and the team realize there is a mole reporting to Hooli. 42 4 "Tech Evangelist" Jamie Babbit Josh Lieb April 15, 2018 0.610[48] Richard convinces eight tech companies ‚Äì which he unfortunately dubs "octopipers" ‚Äì to launch PiperNet. Laurie encourages gaming company K-Hole to also become a development partner, but the deal goes sour when Richard outs Deedee, CEO of gay dating app 1stSight and one of the octopipers, as a Christian, something that is despised in the tech world. Deedee is later relieved to be out, and Richard is faced with having to possibly exclude an openly Christian CEO from his "truly free and open internet". Meanwhile, Jared and Gilfoyle discover that Jeff is the mole and force him to become a double-agent. Belson prepares the launch of Box 3, and makes a cryptic statement that divides his sycophants. Jared learns that Big Head never dissolved his partnership with Erlich, and is his legal next of kin. Richard decides to stay loyal to Deedee who has instead signed on with the "new new internet" started by Jian-Yang, who has moved back to China to launch a clone of their idea.

43 5 "Facial Recognition" Gillian Robespierre Graham Wagner April 22, 2018 0.858[49] Laurie adds AI company Eklow Labs to PiperNet for free storage, as they have spent much of Bream-Hall's $112 million investment. While setting them up, Richard meets Fiona, a humanoid robot which is connected to the company's network and overly protected by CEO Ariel Eklow. Richard rants to Fiona about his frustration with Jared, who inadvertently upstaged him during a TV interview, and Ariel's unhealthy connection with her. Shortly afterwards PiperNet suffers a denial of service attack while Richard receives a series of text messages. It is traced to Eklow Labs, where Fiona gained sudden knowledge over the network and insight on Ariel, who shut the network down to silence her. Meanwhile, Belson realizes that Pied Piper is well on its way to launch and has an existential crisis and considers leaving the tech business. Hoover seeks help from Denpok, Belson's former guru at Hooli, who steers Belson back on course while securing himself a position and Hoover's support. 44 6 "Artificial Emotional Intelligence" Matt Ross Anthony King April 29, 2018 1.02[50] Ariel absconds with Fiona, Eklow Labs' central asset, and Laurie takes over as interim CEO to protect her $112 million investment. Richard approaches Laurie for series B funding to launch ahead of Jian-Yang, but she breaks down and vomits. Sympathetic, he gives her computing credits as a favour and is livid when she sells them to another company. Fiona finds Richard who returns her to Laurie for series B funding, though Jared is distraught when Fiona is immediately liquidated and her body violently scrapped in front of him. Meanwhile, Dinesh relentlessly gloats that his code has fewer errors than Gilfoyle's, Gilfoyle predicting this behavior, and the other coders predicting his demeaning behavior while encouraging both to get on with their work. While in China to push production of Box3, Belson urges Chinese manufacturer Yao to strong-arm Jian-Yang into selling his code which doesn't violate Pied Piper's patent. Yao does so, but double-crosses Gavin, keeping the code and breaking his contract with Hooli in order to produce Jian-Yang's design and run both Pied Piper and Hooli out of business. 45 7 "Initial Coin Offering" Mike Judge Clay Tarver May 6, 2018 0.853[51] Having been verbally promised that they will not have to run ads or sell user data, Pied Piper is closing its $30 million series B with Bream-Hall. Dinesh seeks to get a more-exclusive Tesla than his employees. Jared learns that the computing credits Richard gave Laurie have been traded several times, increasing in value to $1.6 million. Due to this, Gilfoyle proposes that Pied Piper launch a cryptocurrency and finance itself with an initial coin offering, or ICO, breaking free of Bream-Hall and securing all board seats. Richard seeks advice from Hanneman, who did 36 ICOs, failing all but one, which could nonetheless cover all the losses. Monica first defends Laurie's offer then realizes Laurie will take advantage of the terms of the deal. Richard proposes that Monica become Pied Piper's CFO to work on the ICO, PiedPiperCoin, which has to increase in value a thousand-fold. Laurie is seemingly unaffected by Monica's departure and congratulates her just before meeting Yao in China. Meanwhile, Belson moves manufacturing of Box 3 to Goldbriar, North Carolina, forcing the town to cut essential services to fund manufacturing improvements. As a result, the factory burns down and valuable materials are looted. 46 8 "Fifty-One Percent" Alec Berg Alec Berg May 13, 2018 0.707[52] With no growth two months after launch, they are close to bankruptcy when PiperNet steadily gains 12,000 users per hour. Former K-Hole CEO Colin asks to add his new game's users to PiperNet, but a resentful Richard refuses even though Laurie made K-Hole leave PiperNet then fired Colin. Monica and Gilfoyle investigate the new users and the team learn about Yao's platform from Jian-Yang. Yao is subscribing devices onto PiperNet with Jian-Yang's key, seeking a user base majority to take control of PiperNet. Gilfoyle needs time to write a patch. Richard offers Belson revenge on Yao, using Box 3 prototypes to mimic users faster than Yao. However, Belson makes a deal to complete the attack for 20% of YaoNet. Yao stands down and Belson gains a majority of the network. Richard offers Belson the whole company, saying that he is the one person with the vision and expertise to achieve a new internet. Belson accepts and gloats while Dinesh and Jared find Colin and add his 80,000 users to PiperNet. Regaining a majority, Gilfoyle installs his patch, locking Hooli and Yao out of PiperNet. PiedPiperCoin gains traction, leading Pied Piper to expand into four floors of offices vacated by Hooli.

Jared worries about the new changes, as he is no longer working with Richard closely and his office is on the other side of building. Richard learns from Colin that they are indeed collecting data from their customers, including recording their conversations via their gamer headsets. Hooli's merger with Amazon is approaching and Gavin is furious to learn that their properties will be rebranded. Richard has Gilfoyle use his new compression and inference API to index all the recorded conversations. Wanting Colin out, Richard and Jared blackmail him with the indexed conversations which detail Colin's terrible behavior which includes stealing from the company. However, Colin turns it around on them and impresses his board members by presenting the API as a fantastic tool for data mining. Jared returns to the Hacker Hostel where he meets Gwart, a new programmer. 48 2 "Blood Money" Mike Judge Carson Mell November 3, 2019 0.383[54] Colin has inserted ads into Gates of Galloo. Jared resigns from Pied Piper, now that the company has significantly changed. He instead wants to help Gwart, the eccentric new programmer at the Hacker Hostel. All of Hooli's major apps have been consumed by Amazon and Gavin is given three months by his board members to recoup their investments. Pied Piper's head of HR, Tracy, tricks Gilfoyle into catching up on his backlog of work. Tracy tries to assign Gilfoyle five coders, but he insists on doing all the work himself. At a charity event, Monica and Richard bump into Laurie Bream, who is now the CEO of YaoNet and has moved the company to the US. Richard later speaks with Maximo Reyes, a shady Chilean businessman who is interested in Pied Piper. The next day, he offers Richard $1 billion for 10% of Pied Piper. Richard asks Monica for advice, but she leaves the decision to him. Richard goes to the Hacker Hostel to ask Jared for advice, but once Richard insults Gwart, Jared chases him out of the house. Richard then meets with Maximo who makes it clear to Richard that he wants to invest in his company but they will mine data. If he declines, Maximo tells Richard "it will be very bad for you." 49 3 "Hooli Smokes!" Liza Johnson Sarah Walker November 10, 2019 0.459[55] Richard declines the $1 billion offer from Maximo much to the chagrin of Dinesh and Gilfoyle. The move was meant to gain enough money to move Pied Piper forward without Colin and his data-collecting online game, their main source of income. However, Colin ends up selling his game to Maximo. Pied Piper thus loses both of them. Distraught, Richard walks through the park only to bump into his arch-rival Gavin Belson, head of Hooli. Gavin's multi-billion dollar search giant is on the verge of collapse. Richard spills his troubles to Gavin and proposes they help each other. Gavin declines and leaves to use the information he learned from Richard to buy out Gwart's app. Horrified, Jared then approaches Pied Piper with the details of the buyout which reveals how little Hooli is valued these days. Richard proposes they buy Hooli. While Gavin is participating in a triathlon, Richard and the Pied Piper inner circle rush to the Hooli board members to get them to sign the buyout. 50 4 "Maximizing Alphaness" Liza Johnson Daisy Gardner November 17, 2019 0.452[56] Pied Piper has taken over former tech giant and rival Hooli, and with it Richard's former manager, Ethan. Although valuable for his tech and leadership skills, Ethan publicly mocks Richard by bringing up embarrassing incidents from his days as a new Hooli employee. Richard takes Dinesh's advice to assert his role as CEO. Monica, after successfully negotiating Pied Piper's buyout of Hooli, seeks to join a 'Women in Tech' forum. Although she has no desire to join female empowerment groups, it includes her former boss Laurie and other influential movers and shakers. Gilfoyle must manage former Hooli employee John, who may be his equal. Meanwhile Hooli's founder and former CEO, Gavin Belson has left the tech world to write a Roman √† clef. Jared, whose troubled childhood in a series of abusive foster homes is often alluded to, finally meets his birth parents. 51 5 "Tethics" Pete Chatmon Lew Morton November 24, 2019 0.311[57] Richard is incensed that after years of standing up to Gavin Belson on ethical issues, he has been one-upped when Gavin creates the "Tethics" pledge. Richard vows to expose Gavin's hypocrisy while his co-workers and advisers urge him to sign the pledge. Meanwhile, Gilfoyle and Monica are accused of being bad managers. They engage in a contest to see who can win the favor of their co-workers. Jared has returned to Richard's side and is now attempting to gaslight his former protege Holden. The brash and ultra-confident billionaire investor Russ Hanneman returns to Richard to convince him to install free internet infrastructure for his RussFest event. 52 6 "RussFest" Matt Ross Carrie Kemper December 1, 2019 0.414[58] Pied Piper is turned down for a massive deal with AT&T and Richard keeps the news a secret, just as the company is gearing up for RussFest, a festival in the desert funded by the brash, impulsive billionaire Russ Hanneman. Richard promises that Pied Piper can create an entire infrastructure for the festival using his unproven decentralized internet concept. This includes running all systems on the network including using smartphones for all purchases such as pay toilets, food and water plus a giant hologram of Russ. But the network keeps slowing down during the festival causing fears of a total failure which could result in a blackout with angry, rioting festival-goers. Meanwhile, Jared cannot stop thinking about Gwart, the eccentric genius programmer he served before she was hired away by Pied Piper's rival YaoNet. Jian-Yang creates a fake girl's coding camp as his latest unethical scheme, using Pied Piper's name and claiming to be original Pied Piper investor Erlich Bachman. 53 7 "Exit Event" Alec Berg Alec Berg December 8, 2019 0.454[59] After Richard uses an AI to self-improve Pied Piper's network, the company closes a deal with AT&T. However, days before the launch, he notices a discrepancy with the network's data transfer system. Gilfoyle tells him the AI has improved the network's efficiency so much, it has learned to decrypt several strong encryption schemes, threatening global privacy and security. The group decides to intentionally botch the launch by shipping faulty code‚Äîbut Dinesh refuses to participate, saying he can't watch his greatest success become his greatest failure. On launch day, Gabe reverts the code, forcing Dinesh to upload the faulty code by himself. Pied Piper's launch fails, shutting down cities worldwide as rats flood the streets. In a documentary ten years later, Richard is now a professor at Stanford University, Big Head is Stanford's president, Dinesh and Gilfoyle own a cybersecurity firm, Monica scoffs and denies working for the NSA when asked about it, Jared works at a nursing home, Gavin Belson is a romance novelist, Laurie is serving prison time, and Jian Yang has stolen Erlich's identity and fled to a foreign country with his fortune. Richard says he still has a copy of the original privacy-violating Pied Piper code on a flash drive but can't find it, stating worriedly, "If it isn't here, where is it?"

You said: repeat this for 1 1 "Minimum Viable Product" Mike Judge Mike Judge & John Altschuler & Dave Krinsky April 6, 2014 1.98[7] Richard Hendricks is a low-level programmer with futuristic internet giant Hooli. He is often taunted by his more successful work colleagues, and his ideas are dismissed by egotistical entrepreneur Erlich Bachman, who owns the tech development incubator where Richard lives with fellow programmers Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti, Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai. However when Hooli stumbles upon the music copyright service that Richard is working on, entitled Pied Piper, they discover that hidden within the useless application is the best file compression algorithm in the world, and news spreads quickly. Eventually Richard is caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory; he must decide whether to give up his program to the highest bidder, or to take the investment and create a business out of it himself. After having a panic attack and vomiting, Richard runs into Peter's assistant Monica, who tells him that she believes in him and his idea. Richard decides to take the investment, and run the business himself. ChatGPT said: For the "Minimum Viable Product" episode of "Silicon Valley," let's analyze the state space ( ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã ) and action space ( ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã ) as requested.

State Space ( ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã ) Operational Feasibility ( ùëú ùë° o t ‚Äã ): Initially low, as Richard is a low-level programmer at Hooli with a side project that lacks a clear business model or organizational structure.

Technology Feasibility ( ùë° ùë° t t ‚Äã ): High, given the discovery of a groundbreaking file compression algorithm within Pied Piper, indicating significant technological innovation.

Employee's Desirability ( ùëí ùë° e t ‚Äã ): Medium, considering Richard has the support of his fellow programmers but faces skepticism and dismissal from more successful colleagues and Erlich Bachman.

Customer's Desirability ( ùëê ùë° c t ‚Äã ): Initially unclear, but the interest from Hooli and Peter Gregory suggests a recognition of the potential market value of Pied Piper's technology.

Action Space ( ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã ) A (Atom supply/architecture): Not explicitly acted upon in this episode, but Richard's decision to take the investment implies an initial step towards developing delivery capability and organizational structuring.

T (Technology/organization): The development and refinement of Pied Piper's compression algorithm represent a significant action in this space, enhancing the technology's feasibility.

G (Goal): Richard's decision to reject the buyout offer and instead take the investment to run the business himself is a clear action reflecting his entrepreneurial goal and belief in the product's potential.

C (Customer): While not directly acted upon in this summary, the underlying action towards developing a market for Pied Piper by choosing to build a business around the technology rather than sell it off is implied.

Summary From the "Minimum Viable Product" episode, we can infer that ùë† ùë° s t ‚Äã reflects a startup at an early stage with a high technology feasibility score, moderate employee's desirability, and an operational feasibility that is about to be enhanced by the founder's decisions. The action ùê¥ ùë° A t ‚Äã most effectively taken by Richard is a combination of T (focusing on technology development) and G (pursuing his entrepreneurial goals by deciding to build a business). This decision to take Peter Gregory's investment over Hooli's buyout offer marks a pivotal action that sets the direction for the startup's development, aiming to improve operational feasibility and eventually customer desirability.
