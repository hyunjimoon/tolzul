# Tolzul System

Three folders. One cycle. Simple.

## Structure
- **♻️world/** - Past experiences affecting me
- **🟧amoon/** - Present work affecting world
- **⭕sun/** - Future pulling me forward

## The Cycle

```
     🔴 sun
      ↑  ↓
    ♻️ world
      ↑  ↓  
   🟧 amoon
```

World transforms me. I transform world. Sun guides direction.

## Navigation
Just follow the folders. They tell the whole story.
