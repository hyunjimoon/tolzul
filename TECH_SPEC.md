# Tech Spec Guidelines

> Tech Spec is a pre-development document that technically proposes how a feature will be implemented, serving not as a static record but as a medium for productive discussion.

## Purpose

As a key collaboration tool, Tech Spec:
- ‚úÖ Reduces post-implementation rework and communication costs
- ‚úÖ Enables more robust designs through early peer feedback
- ‚úÖ Creates shared understanding before coding begins

---

## When to Write a Tech Spec

Write a Tech Spec **before** implementing any feature that:
- Takes more than 2 hours to build
- Affects multiple files or components
- Changes existing data structures or APIs
- Requires coordination with advisors or collaborators

---

## Tech Spec Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Tech Spec

## 1. Problem Statement
What problem are we solving? Why now?

## 2. Proposed Solution
High-level approach and key design decisions

## 3. Technical Design
- Data structures
- Algorithm/model specifications
- File changes required
- Dependencies

## 4. Implementation Plan
Step-by-step breakdown with time estimates

## 5. Open Questions
What needs discussion or advisor input?

## 6. Alternatives Considered
What other approaches did we reject and why?
```

## Best Practices

1. **Share early**: Circulate Tech Spec when it's 60% complete
2. **Request specific feedback**: "Does this model specification make sense?" vs "Any thoughts?"
3. **Update after discussion**: Tech Spec is a living document during pre-implementation
4. **Archive after completion**: Keep as reference but don't maintain post-implementation

## Examples

- See `Front/On/strategic ambiguity/empirics/workflow(hypothesis, data, model).md` for data analysis Tech Spec
- See `[future examples]` for code implementation Tech Specs
