[[charlie_fine]],  [[scott_stern]] 께,
저는 은행을 운영합니다. 의식적이든 무의식적이든, 상대의 낙관을 제 낙관과 포개어, 협력 논리로 설득할 때 빚이 쌓입니다. 그런 책임이 제 삶의 동력입니다. 다른 모든 상황이 불확실해졌지만, 더욱 확실해진 것은, 당신들이 절 믿고 해주셨던 투자가 헛되지 않게 하겠다는 마음이 제가 평생 침대에서 일어나는 동기가 될것이라는 겁니다. 감사합니다.

**Deliver**: 🐅×🐢 = ✓ Mathematical formalization enables systematic personality assessment

## Key Insights from Conversation

### 1. The Curiosity-Energy Formula
- Monetizing curiosity: $ earned per curiosity solved / energy invested
- Loud people = high denominator (energy) + low numerator (curiosity) = bad deal
- Exception: if something distinct beyond loudness (e.g., unique fashion)

### 2. Types of Interesting
- **Unpredictable + High Energy**: Avoided gaze person (what are they hiding?)
- **Predictable but Far from Mean**: Vernon's poetic academic writing
- **Style Variance**: Personal mean ≠ population mean but still predictable

### 3. Decision Framework
- High energy state → Choose unpredictable (avoided gaze)
- Low energy state → Choose predictable but unique
- Eyes reveal: resistance, strength, playfulness (forms of pushback)

### 4. State vs Action Model
- State (changes faster): emotions, knowledge, eye contact patterns
- Action (requires effort): choosing to engage, speaking
- Entrepreneurial world ≠ RL grid (no fixed states/actions)

## Angie's Capability
""I'm good at re-presenting others' thoughts using analogy and formalizing them (probability, statistics, optimization)""
- Decomposition: population mean (X̄) vs personal mean (X̄ᵢ) vs instance (Xᵢⱼ)
- Conditional structure: P(action | emotional state)
- Optimization: maximize curiosity/energy ratio",11.196266325514792,75.25626597640542,59.24126606368276,66.66666666666666,30.98905818685393,2025-08-04/2025-08-10
