# Class 9: Risk Pooling & Network Effects (🏊‍♀️🚚)
*Aug 4, 2025 | [Transcript](./🦦/9pool(walmart, amazon)15778_intro_ops_otter_ai.md)*

## 🎯 Teaching Arc
**Hook**: "Yedioth problem: 14,000 SKUs, weekly delivery, unpredictable demand"  
**Puzzle**: How manage inventory when each store's demand varies wildly?  
**Resolution**: Pool data across stores - variance reduces by √n  
**Model**: Virtual pooling > physical pooling (information > inventory)

## 🗣️ Quality Participation

**Manuel**: "Looks like portfolio - correlation?"
- Prof: Good connection to finance concepts
- Impact: Opened risk pooling discussion

**Dimitri**: "Track online demand to fill inventory"
- Builds toward omnichannel strategy

**Sandra**: "Two trips problematic - can't transfer inventory"
- Identifies key constraint in decentralized system

**Key Insight**: ⭐️Sun-Sat cycle, replenishment end of Sat
- "Tradeoff between certainty vs flexibility"
- Prof: "I like where your head is heading"

## 📊 Quick Scores
Track students who:
- Make cross-domain connections (portfolio theory)
- Identify operational constraints
- Propose data-driven solutions

### Traditional Distribution
```
    🟢 Weekly van delivery   🟣 Small retailers
       14,000 SKUs             Wide variety need
            \                    /
              Coordinate ←→ Compel
            /                    \
    🟠 Minimize returns      🔴 One-stop shop
       Reduce stockouts        Fresh weekly
```

### Pooled Strategy
```
    🟢 Centralized data      🟣 Store network
       Delayed allocation       Demand visibility
            \                    /
              Coordinate ←→ Compel
            /                    \
    🟠 ⭐️Pool risk         🔴 Better fill rates
       Lower inventory         Fewer stockouts
```

## 📚 Exam Essentials
**Concepts**: 
- Risk pooling: σ_pooled = σ_individual/√n
- ⭐️Formula modularizes thoughts
- Delayed differentiation/allocation

**Key Trade-offs**:
- Certainty (early allocation) vs Flexibility (wait for info)
- Physical pooling (warehouse) vs Virtual (data)
- Service level vs Inventory investment

**Strategy**: 
1. Aggregate demand data across locations
2. Delay allocation decisions
3. Use ⭐️"eyeballs effect" - more data points = better prediction

**Traps**: 
❌"Need physical consolidation" 
✅"Information can substitute for inventory"

## 🎓 Recitation Points
- "Two-phase distribution: print centrally, allocate late"
- "Savings from pooling + freed printing capacity"
- "Energy providers face same challenge - hoarding vs sharing"
- "Broader assortment possible with returns option"
