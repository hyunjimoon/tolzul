🚨 WEAKEST LINK: Right side - No clear revenue model or unit economics shown
🧪 BREAK TEST: Test conversion from social engagement to actual investment
- Cost: 2 weeks, $1K in ads
- Decision rule: If <5% convert from social to invest → pivot model, if >15% → scale

EVIDENCE SHOWN:
✓ Strong: Large market ($72B crowdfunding), clear trend
✗ Weak: No revenue proof, just working mockup and "partnerships"

GRADE: 3/6
- Focus (1): Too broad - "intersection of money, impact, social networks"
- Evidence (1): Interest only, no revenue metrics
- Experiment (1): No critical assumption identified

ONE LINE: Promising market timing but lacks focus and revenue validation.
