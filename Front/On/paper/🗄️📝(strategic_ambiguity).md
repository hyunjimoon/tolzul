# 1. intro
## null of clear promise
1. story of ambiguity - precise on communication - natural not to be; "conditional under which use" ambiguity

closely related are TWO papers 
- my work in your space (success probability), (how it is different [[Archibald,]])
- AOM audience
## game structure (simple)

customer <> founder
success : = probability of Sell and Deliver given promise level, 

## game structure (extendable)
customer/VC/co-founder <> founder

## game function
1. higher i promise, the harder it is to deliver, but the more customer wants
2. mean is obvious, but variance it's not straightforward
	1. [ambiguity -> variance]

## prediction of my model

my model produces conditions; higher precision 


# 2. literature review


# 3. methods
(- condition independence of sell and deliver given promise)
