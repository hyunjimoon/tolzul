### **Methods Section:**

> "We define early-stage funding (E) as companies at Early Stage VC funding at baseline (January 2022). Later success (L) is defined as companies that progressed to Later Stage VC funding by the endpoint (December 2023). Our primary outcome is the 2-year conditional progression rate: Pr(L=1 | E=1, baseline cohort)."

### **Limitations Section:**

> "Our cross-sectional cohort design does not capture companies that progressed from early to late stage before our baseline observation (left truncation). This may lead to underestimation of progression rates for the fastest-growing companies. However, this design allows us to examine the mediating role of early funding on the vagueness-success relationship within a defined temporal window."
