**Abstract.** **Problem definition:** Founders face a commitment–flexibility tension when crafting venture promises. Strategic **vagueness** can depress the information value of a pitch while preserving real‑options value when options are **exercisable**. We study when and how this trade‑off shapes financing outcomes: the **early funding amount** at Series A (E) and the **later success** of raising Series B+ within a horizon _t_ ($L_t$). Our framework is a two‑audience, Bayesian account in which evidence partitions investors’ priors (information value ↓ in vagueness) and exercisability raises the payoff to keeping options open (option value ↑ in vagueness), implying an interior optimum **V*** and heterogeneity by flexibility **F** (e.g. hardware↔software).  

**Methodology/results:** We operationalize **V** with a two‑component text index that combines _categorical vagueness_ and _concreteness deficit_ (0–100, min–max scaled), and measure **F** from architectural cues (hardware vs. software) and quantum option‑levels (1=rigid superconducting, 2=modular ion/photon, 3=software/SDK). Outcomes are **E** (Series‑A amount) and **L** (probability of Series B+ within 2–4 years for a fixed A‑round cohort), with a survivors‑only **step‑up ratio S** used as a mechanism check. Estimation links **E** to **V** via OLS and **L** to **V × F** via logit with cohort/fixed‑effects and robustness via specification curves. Conceptually and empirically, we find: (i) an **early precision premium**—a one‑SD increase in **V** is associated with **X–Y%** lower Series‑A capital (β_{EV}<0); (ii) **flexibility‑amplified later benefits**—the slope of **V** is near zero or negative in hardware but positive in software so that **β_V+β_{VF}>0**; and (iii) among survivors, higher **V×F** predicts larger **S**, consistent with option value being exercised. 

**Managerial implications:** The results yield a simple rule for “**when to be vague**.” In early markets, vagueness is penalized because investors price missing information; founders can mitigate this by **raising exercisability**—improving matching credibility, modularizing architectures, lowering reconfiguration and experiment costs, and clarifying governance paths. Where **F** is high (e.g., software‑centric or modular stacks with rich experiment pipelines), calibrated vagueness buys valuable options that are realized at later rounds. For investors and ecosystem builders, reductions in exercisability frictions (infrastructure, contracting, experimentation) should be rewarded because they convert early ambiguity into later, option‑driven performance. 

**Key words:** strategic vagueness; flexibility/exercisability; real options; Bayesian entrepreneurship; venture financing; Series A; Series B+; step‑up ratio; quantum computing.

Abstract. Problem definition: Food waste imposes significant environmental and societal consequences, with households responsible for approximately 37% of total food waste in the United States. While online grocery shopping becomes increasingly prevalent, its impact on household food waste remains an open question. This study provides the first empirical analysis of the causal relationship between online grocery shopping frequency and household food waste. 

Methodology/results: We first develop a conceptual model that captures households’ grocery shopping behavior to motivate our empirical analysis. Using large-scale consumer panel data from 2017 to 2019, we analyze six product categories that vary in perishability. We construct a proxy defined as purchased quantity per inter-trip day per capita (QIC) to capture household food waste. To address endogeneity in online shopping behavior, we employ a two-stage regression with two instrumental variables: lagged household online shopping rate and the average online shopping rate among nearby households. 

Our results show that greater online shopping frequency significantly reduces household food waste for perishable products such as bread and cheese, while the effect is smaller or nonsignificant for less perishable products such as cereals and cookies, consistent with our theoretical predictions. 

Our findings are robust to alternative specifications, including the use of single-instrument and zip code fixed effects models. Managerial implications: Our results highlight online grocery platforms as a promising lever for reducing household food waste, offering actionable implications for both government agencies and retailers. Investing in online infrastructure and encouraging consumer migration to online channels may serve the dual objective of supporting sustainability goals while also meeting evolving shopper preferences. 

Importantly, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating product-level perishability into the design and targeting of digital grocery systems. Focusing operational efforts and promotional strategies on highly perishable categories may offer the greatest impact in curbing household food waste.
