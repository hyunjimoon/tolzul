More closely aligned with our work is Ananda et al. (2023), which uses a national survey of 5,272 households and applies a zero-inflated ordered probit model to analyze self-reported food waste outcomes. Their findings suggest a positive association between online grocery shopping and household food waste, with more frequent shopping and higher spending linked to increased waste. Our study differs from this work in three key respects. 
- First, while Ananda et al. (2023) controls for various household characteristics, it does not address potential endogeneity between online shopping behavior and food waste generation, and thus does not establish a causal relationship. In contrast, we employ an instrumental variable strategy using both lagged online shopping behavior and neighborhood-level online adoption to identify the causal effect of online shopping frequency on food waste. 
- Second, Ananda et al. (2023) analyzes food waste at an aggregate level, without accounting for differences across product categories. Our analysis disaggregates the data by product type, allowing us to examine how the relationship between online shopping and food waste varies with product characteristics, namely, perishability. 
- Third, whereas Ananda et al. (2023) relies on self-reported waste data, we construct a proxy using consumer panel purchase records. These methodological distinctions allow us to make stronger causal claims and offer actionable insights for waste reduction strategies that are tailored to product type.
