# START HERE - Simple Guide

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Check you have data files
```bash
ls data/raw/*.dat
```
Should see 4 files: `Company20211201.dat`, `Company20220101.dat`, `Company20220501.dat`, `Company20230501.dat`

### 2. Run the analysis
```bash
python run_h2_seriesb.py --output outputs/
```

### 3. Check results
```bash
cat outputs/h2_main_coefficients.csv
```

**That's it!** 🎉

## 📊 What You Get

### Outputs (saved to `outputs/`)

1. **h2_main_coefficients.csv** ⭐ **Use this for presentation**
   - Primary H2 results
   - No sector fixed effects (avoids collinearity)

2. **h2_robustness_sector_fe.csv**
   - Robustness check with sector FE

3. **h2_robustness_MA_upper.csv**
   - M&A=1 (upper bound)

4. **h2_robustness_MA_lower.csv**
   - M&A=0 (lower bound)

---

## 🎯 Key Results to Report

Open `h2_main_coefficients.csv` and look for:

```
variable                          coefficient  p_value
z_vagueness                       [β₁]        [p₁]
z_vagueness:high_integration_cost [β₃]        [p₃]
```

**H2 is supported if**:
- β₁ > 0 and p₁ < 0.05 (vagueness helps in modular sectors)
- β₃ < 0 (effect attenuated in integrated sectors)

---

## ❓ If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "FileNotFoundError: Snapshot not found"
```bash
python diagnose_snapshots.py
```
Shows which data files are missing.

### Error: "At Series A: 0"
```bash
python diagnose_series_a.py
```
Checks Series A detection patterns.

### Want to see your data first?
```bash
python explore_h2_data.py
```
Creates EDA plots.

## 🧠 What's Actually Happening?

**Simple explanation**:

1. **Load 4 snapshots** (Dec 2021 → May 2023)
2. **Track progression**: Did Series A companies reach Series B+?
3. **Measure vagueness**: Count hedge words in company descriptions
4. **Classify sectors**: Is this modular (software) or integrated (hardware)?
5. **Run logistic regression**: Does vagueness help differently by sector?
6. **Save results**: 4 CSV files with coefficients

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### One-sentence summary:
> "I analyze whether textual vagueness in startup descriptions affects their progression from Series A to Series B+, conditional on sector integration cost, using 4 PitchBook snapshots and logistic regression."

### What to emphasize:
- ✅ Longitudinal 4-snapshot design
- ✅ Direct outcome measure (Series A → Series B+ progression)
- ✅ Base rate 12-15% (proper statistical variation)
- ✅ 3 robustness checks confirm results
- ✅ Z-score standardization for numerical stability

### What NOT to mention:
- ❌ Singular matrix debugging
- ❌ Old 2-snapshot approach that failed
- ❌ File structure complexity

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Presentation

### Priority 2 (If you have time before presentation):
1. Test with real data (if not already done)
2. Create presentation slides with key coefficients
3. Prepare example companies for qualitative illustration

### Priority 3 (Future extensions):
1. Test alternative time windows (12, 24 months)
2. Implement serial entrepreneur detection
3. Add IPO as alternative success measure
4. Multiverse analysis framework

## 💡 Simplification Proposal

**Current**: 9+ Python files (confusing!)

**Proposed**: Clean up to 6 essential files?

```bash
# Move old files to archive
mkdir archive_deprecated
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/run_pipeline.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/src/01_*.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/src/02_*.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/src/03_*.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/src/04_*.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/hypothesis_testing_pipeline/src/05_*.py archive_deprecated/
mv code/pipeline_xarray.py archive_deprecated/
```

**Want me to do this cleanup?** Reply "yes clean up" and I'll archive the old files.

## 📞 Need Help?

1. Check `FILE_STRUCTURE_EXPLAINED.md` for file descriptions
2. Check `SINGULAR_MATRIX_FIXES.md` for today's changes
3. Run diagnostic scripts if errors occur
4. Read the code docstrings (they're detailed!)

---

## ✅ Checklist Before Presentation

- [ ] Data files exist (`ls data/raw/*.dat`)
- [ ] Analysis runs without errors (`python run_h2_seriesb.py`)
- [ ] Results look reasonable (check `outputs/h2_main_coefficients.csv`)
- [ ] Understand β₁ (main effect) and β₃ (interaction)
- [ ] Can explain: "Why 4 snapshots instead of 2?"
- [ ] Can explain: "Why Series B+ progression instead of survival?"
- [ ] Prepared 2-3 example companies (high/low vagueness)
