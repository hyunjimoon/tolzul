> **Purpose** — This one-pager upgrades the POC report by (i) reframing **H2** as **conditional** on *integration cost*, (ii) clarifying that the POC's Model 2 is an *incomplete baseline* when sector effects are only absorbed as fixed effects, and (iii) adding **Model 3 (interaction)** plus **Figure 4**, which makes the mechanism visually explicit.

## 1. Hypotheses — conditional (2 + 1 paragraphs)

**H1 (Short-term cost; validated):** Relative to precise promises, *vague* promises reduce initial funding. Credibility is costly to earn up-front.

**H2 (Long-term benefit; conditional):** The survival benefit of vagueness is **realizable only where pivot costs are low** (modular sectors); it is **unrealizable** where pivot costs are high (integrated sectors).

**Mechanism — Why does pivot cost matter?** In the early **era of ferment**, the cone of uncertainty is wide. When *integration cost* is low (software/API, “**Lego**”), vague positioning preserves option value because a pivot is actually feasible. When integration cost is high (hardware/robotics/AV, “**Battleship**”), the same vagueness rarely converts to an adaptive move; sunk, asset‑specific investments make strategic repositioning costly or slow. Therefore, **H2a (Realizable option value)**: in modular sectors vagueness raises later success; **H2b (Unrealizable option value)**: in integrated sectors vagueness does not help (and may hurt).

**Model intuition (one paragraph):** The OIL rule formalizes this: $\tau^* = \max\{0, \sqrt{V/(4i)} - 1\}$. As *value* $V$ rises over time (dominant design emerges) and *integration cost* $i$ differs across sectors, optimal precision $\tau^*$ rises faster in modular sectors than in integrated ones.  (See citations in the PDF cover note.)

## 2. Data — scope & variables (unchanged core)

- **Source assumption**: PitchBook company descriptions (text) + deal records (funding outcomes).
- **Key variables**: `vagueness` (100 − LIWC certitude), `early_funding` (Series A dollars), `later_success` (Series B funded = 1), controls (`team_size`, `prior_exit`), and **sector** coded by *integration cost* (Low = software/API; High = hardware/robotics/chip).

*Synthetic sample used here only for Figure 4:* `synthetic_panel_FINAL.csv` (N=160 firms).

## 3. Models — equations, purpose, and the interaction upgrade

### Model 1 (OLS; keep as is)

$$ \textbf{EarlyFunding}_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1\cdot \textbf{Vagueness}_i + \Gamma^\top \mathbf{X}_i + \varepsilon_i $$
Expectation: $\alpha_1 < 0$. (POC confirmed.)

### Model 2 (Logit; *incomplete baseline*)

$$\operatorname{logit}\, P(\textbf{LaterSuccess}_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot \textbf{Vagueness}_i + \beta_2\cdot \textbf{EarlyFunding}_i + \Gamma^\top \mathbf{X}_i + \eta_i $$

**Purpose:** Pools sectors to estimate an average H2.  
**Limitation:** Treating **Sector** only as a fixed effect *averages away* the mechanism; positive effects in modular sectors and null/negative effects in integrated sectors can cancel.

### Model 3 (Logit with interaction; the correct test)

$$ \operatorname{logit}\, P(\textbf{LaterSuccess}_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot \textbf{Vagueness}_i + \beta_2\cdot \textbf{HighIntCost}_i + \beta_3\cdot (\textbf{Vagueness}_i \times \textbf{HighIntCost}_i) + \beta_4\cdot \textbf{EarlyFunding}_i + \Gamma^\top \mathbf{X}_i + \eta_i $$

**Predictions:** $\beta_1>0$ (modular slope), $\beta_3<0$ (slope dampens/reverses under high integration), and $\beta_1+\beta_3 \le 0$ (integrated net slope non‑positive).

**Sector classification & limitations:** “High integration” includes hardware/robotics/chip/AV—a coarse proxy; misclassification and within‑sector heterogeneity remain possible.

## 4. Results interpretation — aligning POC with the upgraded model

- **Executive summary update:** POC’s **H1** is significant; **H2** is weak in pooled Model 2, which is *expected* if sector heterogeneity is large. Interpreting Model 2 literally risks a false null for H2.
- **Figure 2 (POC):** A noisy positive trend is visible but not significant; *cancellation* across sectors is a plausible explanation.
- **Figure 3 (POC):** Sector success rates diverge materially, motivating an interaction specification rather than fixed effects alone.

## 5. Figure 4 — Option Value Realization by Sector Modularity

![Figure 4. Option Value Realization by Sector Modularity](figure4_option_value_by_modularity.png)

**Caption (complete):** *Figure 4 plots the predicted Series B success probability against **Vagueness** for two sector classes defined by **integration cost**. In **modular** sectors (low integration cost; “Lego”), the slope is positive (realizable option value). In **integrated** sectors (high integration cost; “Battleship”), the slope is flat to negative (unrealizable option value). Curves are computed from a logistic specification with hypothetical parameters consistent with the theory: $\beta_1 = 1.10$, $\beta_3 = -1.35$, so the integrated net slope $\beta_1+\beta_3 = -0.25$. Early funding, team size, and founder prior exit are held at medians for visualization.*

**Axes/legend text:** *x* = Vagueness (0 = precise, 1 = vague); *y* = Predicted Series B success probability; Legend: “Low integration cost (modular, ‘Lego’)” and “High integration cost (integrated, ‘Battleship’)”.

**Statistical annotations (where):** Report $\hat\beta_1$, $\hat\beta_3$, and a Wald test for $\beta_1+\beta_3=0 $ in the panel below the plot; place significance stars next to each line’s slope label at the right edge.

**Implementation (Python example; not executed in this document):**

```python
# Inputs: synthetic_panel_FINAL.csv + betas in table4_model3_betas_USED.csv
import numpy as np, pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv("synthetic_panel_FINAL.csv")

# Display-ready grid
v = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)
b = {'Intercept': -0.4, 'Vagueness': 1.1, 'High_Integration_Cost': -0.25,
      'Vagueness×High_Integration_Cost': -1.35, 'log(Early_Funding)': 0.45,
      'Prior_Exit': 0.35, 'log(Team_Size)': 0.18}
ef = np.log(df['early_funding_musd'].median())
ts = np.log(df['team_size'].median())

def pred(hic):
    z = (b['Intercept'] + b['Vagueness']*v + b['High_Integration_Cost']*hic
         + b['Vagueness×High_Integration_Cost']*v*hic
         + b['log(Early_Funding)']*ef + b['log(Team_Size)']*ts)
    return 1/(1+np.exp(-z))

plt.figure()
plt.plot(v, pred(0), label='Low integration cost (modular, "Lego")')
plt.plot(v, pred(1), '--', label='High integration cost (integrated, "Battleship")')
plt.xlabel("Vagueness (0 = precise, 1 = vague)"); plt.ylabel("Predicted Series B success probability")
plt.title("Figure 4. Option Value Realization by Sector Modularity"); plt.legend(); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```

## 6. Discussion & conclusion (draft)

**Theoretical contribution.** The interaction framing unifies Fine’s **Clockspeed** (temporal rise in $V$) with Stern’s **commitment mechanism** (the cost side $i$). Precision is **earned**, not assumed: vagueness creates *realizable* option value in modular sectors and *non‑realizable* option value in integrated ones. The OIL rule provides the comparative statics.

**Practical implications.** Founders should calibrate promise precision to $V/i$: stay deliberately broad when integration costs dominate; raise precision as value becomes validated. Investors should expect **more vagueness from hardware** than from software at comparable stages, and **more precision at Series B** than at Series A for the same venture.

**Limitations.** Sector coding by integration cost is coarse; within‑sector variance and misclassification are non‑trivial. “Vagueness” can conflate *strategic latitude* with *knowledge gaps*; founder human capital and ambition level should be controlled. Residual confounds include selection on survivors from Series A to Series B and measurement error in time‑stamps.

**Next steps.** (i) Re‑estimate Model 2 with the interaction (Model 3) on the live PitchBook panel; (ii) add an *Aspirational Level* control; (iii) test robustness to alternative text measures (hedge words, jargon density); (iv) preregister the interaction before full sample estimation.
