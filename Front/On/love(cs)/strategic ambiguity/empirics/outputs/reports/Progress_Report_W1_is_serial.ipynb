        "# Introduction & Hypothesis Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Strategic ambiguity—the deliberate use of vague or broad category labels—has been theorized as a **double-edged sword** in entrepreneurial finance. On one hand, category spanning and ambiguous positioning can help startups gain initial attention and resources by appealing to diverse stakeholder groups (Granqvist et al., 2013; Navis & Glynn, 2010; Zuckerman, 1999). On the other hand, the same ambiguity may hinder later-stage scaling by introducing coordination costs, identity confusion, and valuation uncertainty (Negro & Leung, 2013; Wry et al., 2014).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent empirical work suggests that vagueness in startup positioning can serve as a **strategic signal** rather than mere noise. El-Zayaty et al. (2025) find that linguistic ambiguity in pitch decks correlates with early funding success, while Pan et al. (2018) demonstrate that categorical ambiguity enables startups to navigate crowded market spaces. However, these benefits may not persist across growth stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Reversal Hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "We propose a **stage-contingent reversal pattern** in how vagueness affects startup success:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H1 (Early Funding, Series A)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **positively** predicts Series A funding amounts.\n",
        "  *Mechanism*: Ambiguity attracts diverse early-stage investors and signals flexibility/optionality (Huang et al., 2014; Loughran & McDonald, 2016).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H2 (Growth, Series B+ Progression)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **negatively** predicts the likelihood of progressing from Series A to Series B+.\n",
        "  *Mechanism*: As startups scale, investors demand clarity on business model, market fit, and competitive positioning. Persistent ambiguity becomes a liability (Navis et al., 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "This reversal pattern aligns with **dual legitimacy strategies** in organizational theory: early-stage ventures benefit from \"categorical flexibility\" to secure resources, but must converge to \"categorical clarity\" to achieve legitimacy with later-stage stakeholders (Wry et al., 2014; Zuckerman, 1999).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Boundary Conditions: Founder Credibility\n",
        "\n",
        "We further test whether **founder credibility** moderates these relationships:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H3 (Early Funding × Founder Credibility)**: Founder credibility attenuates the positive effect of vagueness on Series A funding.\n",
        "  *Logic*: Credible founders (e.g., serial entrepreneurs) can leverage reputation to offset ambiguity penalties, making vagueness less necessary as a flexibility signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H4 (Growth × Founder Credibility)**: Founder credibility attenuates the negative effect of vagueness on Series B+ progression.\n",
        "  *Logic*: Credible founders can \"buy patience\" from investors, reducing the penalty for unclear positioning during scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "These hypotheses draw on **reputation-based trust** mechanisms in entrepreneurial finance (Hsu, 2007) and the substitution effects between signals documented in labor economics and organizational research (Spence, 1973)."
