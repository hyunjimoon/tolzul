# Executive Summary

This report documents our progress on testing the **Strategic Ambiguity** hypothesis framework with **integration cost** (architecture) as the primary moderator. Following Professor Stern's methodological guidance, we have implemented the **Series A(t₀) → Series B+(t₁)** framework for defining growth trajectories and validated our dependent variable construction against theoretical requirements.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **DV Validation**: Confirmed that our H2/H4 dependent variable (Series B+ progression) correctly implements the at-risk cohort framework (companies at Series A at baseline, excluding prior B+ rounds).

2. **Methodological Refinement**: Implemented Series A filtering using PitchBook's "Early Stage VC" label to isolate true venture-backed companies and exclude angel/seed rounds from H1/H3 analysis.

3. **Integration Cost Moderator**: Tested `is_hardware` as a moderator capturing differences between integrated (hardware/biotech) and modular (software) architectures.

4. **One-Touch Execution System**: Created automated pipeline for reproducibility and rapid iteration.

## Results Summary

```

## Methodological Limitations Identified

```{python}
#| label: limitations
print("""
**17-month follow-up constraint**: Our observation window (December 2021 – May 2023) captures only 17 months of post-Series A progression, well below the recommended 46-month window. This introduces right censoring (≈50-60% false negatives) and restricts our findings to "rapid progressors."

**Cohort heterogeneity**: The at-risk cohort for H2/H4 does not filter by founding year, introducing potential vintage effects that may confound growth trajectories.

These limitations are addressed in Section 4 with proposed robustness checks and reframing strategies.

# Introduction & Hypothesis Framework

## Theoretical Motivation

Strategic ambiguity—the deliberate use of vague or broad category labels—has been theorized as a **double-edged sword** in entrepreneurial finance. On one hand, category spanning and ambiguous positioning can help startups gain initial attention and resources by appealing to diverse stakeholder groups (Granqvist et al., 2013; Navis & Glynn, 2010; Zuckerman, 1999). On the other hand, the same ambiguity may hinder later-stage scaling by introducing coordination costs, identity confusion, and valuation uncertainty (Negro & Leung, 2013; Wry et al., 2014).

Recent empirical work suggests that vagueness in startup positioning can serve as a **strategic signal** rather than mere noise. El-Zayaty et al. (2025) find that linguistic ambiguity in pitch decks correlates with early funding success, while Pan et al. (2018) demonstrate that categorical ambiguity enables startups to navigate crowded market spaces. However, these benefits may not persist across growth stages.

## The Reversal Hypothesis

We propose a **stage-contingent reversal pattern** in how vagueness affects startup success:

- **H1 (Early Funding, Series A)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **positively** predicts Series A funding amounts.
  *Mechanism*: Ambiguity attracts diverse early-stage investors and signals flexibility/optionality (Huang et al., 2014; Loughran & McDonald, 2016).

- **H2 (Growth, Series B+ Progression)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **negatively** predicts the likelihood of progressing from Series A to Series B+.
  *Mechanism*: As startups scale, investors demand clarity on business model, market fit, and competitive positioning. Persistent ambiguity becomes a liability (Navis et al., 2023).

This reversal pattern aligns with **dual legitimacy strategies** in organizational theory: early-stage ventures benefit from "categorical flexibility" to secure resources, but must converge to "categorical clarity" to achieve legitimacy with later-stage stakeholders (Wry et al., 2014; Zuckerman, 1999).

## Boundary Conditions: Integration Cost (Architecture)

We test whether **integration cost** (captured by hardware vs. software architecture) moderates these relationships:

### Theoretical Framework

**Integration Cost Hypothesis**: Hardware and biotech startups face higher integration costs than software startups due to:

1. **Physical component dependencies**: Manufacturing, supply chain, inventory management
2. **Longer development cycles**: Prototyping, testing, regulatory approval (especially biotech)
3. **Capital intensity**: Equipment, facilities, specialized labor
4. **Lower pivot flexibility**: Sunk costs in physical infrastructure

These constraints limit **strategic flexibility**, making vague positioning **more costly** for hardware startups. Conversely, software startups (modular architectures) can pivot quickly, making vague positioning a viable exploration strategy.

### Hypotheses

- **H3 (Early Funding × Architecture)**: Integration cost attenuates the positive effect of vagueness on Series A funding.
  *Logic*: Hardware startups cannot afford vague positioning even at early stages due to capital intensity and longer timelines. Investors demand clarity on technical feasibility and market application.

- **H4 (Growth × Architecture)**: Integration cost amplifies the negative effect of vagueness on Series B+ progression.
  *Logic*: By Series B+, hardware startups with unclear positioning face compounding risks: product-market fit uncertainty plus technical execution risk. Software startups can tolerate more ambiguity during scaling.

**Expected Pattern**: Negative interaction (vagueness helps more in software/modular architectures).

These hypotheses draw on **modularity theory** (Baldwin & Clark, 2000) and **architectural innovation** literature (Henderson & Clark, 1990), applied to entrepreneurial finance contexts.

# Data & Measurement

## Data Source

We use **PitchBook proprietary data** covering venture-backed companies in the United States. Our analysis leverages four temporal snapshots to construct longitudinal outcomes and control for as-of biases:

```{python}
#| label: data-snapshots
snapshots = pd.DataFrame({
    'Snapshot': ['Baseline (t₀)', 'Mid-point 1 (tₘ₁)', 'Mid-point 2 (tₘ₂)', 'Endpoint (t₁)'],
    'Date': ['December 1, 2021', 'January 1, 2022', 'May 1, 2022', 'May 1, 2023'],
    'Purpose': [
        'Extract predictors and define at-risk cohort',
        'Track event ordering',
        'Track event ordering',
        'Observe final outcomes'
    ]
})
print_table(snapshots, max_col_width=30)
```

**Observation window**: 17 months post-baseline (December 2021 – May 2023).

## Key Variables

### Independent Variable: Vagueness
- **Operationalization**: Composite measure based on categorical breadth, keyword diversity, and positioning clarity in company descriptions (normalized as `z_vagueness`).
- **Theoretical grounding**: Loughran & McDonald (2016) document that linguistic ambiguity affects investor perceptions in financial disclosures; we extend this to startup positioning.

### Dependent Variables

#### H1/H3: Early Funding (Series A Amount)
- **Variable**: `early_funding_musd` (first financing size in millions USD)
- **Filter**: **PitchBook "Early Stage VC"** label only (excludes Seed, Angel, Later Stage VC)
- **Rationale**: Isolates true Series A venture rounds.
- **Analysis**: OLS regression (continuous outcome).

#### H2/H4: Growth (Series B+ Progression)
- **Variable**: `growth` (binary: 1 = progressed to Series B+, 0 = remained at A/failed)
- **Framework**: Scott Stern's **Series A(t₀) → Series B+(t₁)** progression model
- **At-risk cohort**: Companies at Series A stage (VC-backed) at baseline with no prior B+ funding
- **Success event**: Transition to Series B+ financing observed after baseline
- **Censoring**: M&A exits treated as competing risk (censored, not failures)
- **Analysis**: Logistic regression (binary outcome).

### Moderator: Integration Cost (is_hardware)

```{python}
#| label: moderator-definition
hw_counts = df['is_hardware'].value_counts()
hw_pct = (hw_counts / hw_counts.sum() * 100).to_dict()

print(f"""
**Operationalization**: Binary indicator (`is_hardware = 1` for hardware/biotech, `0` for software)

**Classification criteria**:
- Hardware (1): Companies with physical products, manufacturing operations, or biotech/pharma focus
- Software (0): Pure software, SaaS, platforms, digital services

**Sample distribution**:
- Hardware/integrated: {hw_pct.get(1, 0):.1f}% (N = {hw_counts.get(1, 0):,})
- Software/modular: {hw_pct.get(0, 0):.1f}% (N = {hw_counts.get(0, 0):,})

**Theoretical grounding**: Modularity theory (Baldwin & Clark, 2000) distinguishes integrated vs. modular architectures based on component interdependencies and interface standards. Hardware startups exhibit higher integration costs due to physical constraints.
""")
```

### Controls

```{python}
#| label: controls-table
controls = pd.DataFrame({
    'Control Variable': ['Firm size', 'Founding cohort', 'Sector fixed effects'],
    'Operationalization': [
        'z_employees_log (log-transformed employee count, standardized)',
        'Categorical fixed effects for founding year bins',
        'Industry classification (H1/H3 only)'
    ],
    'Purpose': [
        'Control for firm scale and resources',
        'Control for vintage effects and macro conditions',
        'Account for sector-specific norms and funding patterns'
    ]
})
print_table(controls, max_col_width=30)
```

## As-of Date Capping

A critical data quality issue: PitchBook snapshots contain **future-dated events** due to retroactive data entry. To prevent **data leakage**, we implemented **as-of date capping**:

- For each snapshot date, we cap `LastFinancingDate` to the snapshot date
- We retain `LastFinancingDealType` (current financing stage) even when dates exceed snapshot cutoffs

This methodological correction is documented in `features.py` (lines 242-282) and prevents upward bias in outcome measurement.

# Dependent Variable Validation & Refinement

## Scott Stern's Guidance: Series A(t₀) → Series B+(t₁) Framework

**Context**: Early iterations of our analysis encountered **singular matrix errors** during logistic regression. Professor Stern advised us to adopt a **success-oriented progression framework** rather than survival analysis, focusing on companies that successfully transition from one financing stage to the next.

### Framework Requirements

```{python}
#| label: framework-requirements
requirements = pd.DataFrame({
    'Requirement': [
        '1. At-risk cohort definition',
        '2. No backward contamination',
        '3. Success event',
        '4. Censoring for competing risks',
        '5. Temporal ordering'
    ],
    'Implementation': [
        'Identify companies at Series A stage at baseline (t₀)',
        'Exclude companies that already reached Series B+ before baseline',
        'Code Y=1 for companies that transition from Series A → Series B+ after baseline',
        'M&A exits censored (coded as missing, not failures)',
        'Use multiple snapshots to determine "first seen" dates'
    ],
    'Status': ['✓ Implemented', '✓ Implemented', '✓ Implemented', '✓ Implemented', '✓ Implemented']
})
print_table(requirements, max_col_width=30)
```

**Why this framework resolves singular matrix errors**: By focusing on a **homogeneous at-risk cohort** (all starting at Series A) and tracking a well-defined transition event (progression to B+), we achieve sufficient outcome variance.

## H2/H4 DV Validation

**Validation Question**: Does the `create_survival_seriesb_progression()` function correctly implement the at-risk cohort framework?

### Findings

```{python}
#| label: dv-validation
validation = pd.DataFrame({
    'Component': [
        'Series A stage identification',
        'No backward contamination',
        'Success event timing',
        'M&A censoring'
    ],
    'Status': ['✓ Correct', '✓ Correct', '✓ Correct', '✓ Correct'],
    'Implementation': [
        'Uses A_STAGE_PAT regex to match "Early Stage VC" label',
        'Excludes companies with prior B+ via no_prior_b filter',
        'Requires b_idx >= 1 (Series B+ appeared AFTER baseline)',
        'M&A exits assigned Y_primary = NaN (censored)'
    ]
})
print_table(validation, max_col_width=30)
```

### ⚠️ Methodological Limitation: Cohort Heterogeneity

The at-risk cohort **does not filter by founding year**. A valid at-risk cohort should be homogeneous by vintage to avoid confounding growth trajectories with macroeconomic conditions or cohort effects.

**Next iteration requirement**: Add a `founding_year` or `founding_cohort` filter to ensure comparable maturity at baseline.

## 17-Month Follow-Up Period: Implications & Robustness Checks

**Data constraint**: Our follow-up period spans only 17 months, substantially shorter than the recommended 46-month window.

### Current Base Rate

```{python}
#| label: base-rate
if 'growth' in df.columns:
    base_rate = df['growth'].mean()
    n_growth_1 = df['growth'].sum()
    n_total = len(df[df['growth'].notna()])
    print(f"""
**Base rate**: {base_rate:.1%} of at-risk companies progress to Series B+ within 17 months

- Successful progressions (Y=1): {int(n_growth_1):,}
- No progression (Y=0): {int(n_total - n_growth_1):,}
- Total at-risk: {n_total:,}

**Reframing**: We focus on **rapid Series B+ progression (≤17 months)** rather than eventual success. This is a theoretically meaningful outcome signaling strong product-market fit.

# Model Specifications & Results

## H1: Early Funding (OLS)

### Model Specification

**Research Question**: Does vagueness predict Series A funding amounts?

$$
\text{early\_funding\_musd} \sim \text{z\_vagueness} + \text{z\_employees\_log} + C(\text{founding\_cohort}) + C(\text{sector\_fe})
$$

**Estimation**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

### Results

```{python}
#| label: h1-results
#| tbl-cap: "H1 Coefficients: Early Funding (OLS)"
print("#### Coefficient Table\n")
print(h1_coef.to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".4f"))

# Extract key coefficient
vague_row = h1_coef[h1_coef['variable'].str.contains('vagueness', case=False, na=False)]
if len(vague_row) > 0:
    vague_coef = vague_row['coefficient'].values[0]
    vague_p = vague_row['p_value'].values[0]
    vague_ci_lower = vague_row['ci_lower'].values[0] if 'ci_lower' in vague_row.columns else np.nan
    vague_ci_upper = vague_row['ci_upper'].values[0] if 'ci_upper' in vague_row.columns else np.nan

    print(f"\n**Key Finding**:")
    print(f"- Vagueness coefficient: {vague_coef:.4f} (95% CI: [{vague_ci_lower:.4f}, {vague_ci_upper:.4f}])")
    print(f"- p-value: {vague_p:.4f}")
    print(f"- Interpretation: {'Vagueness significantly increases Series A funding' if vague_coef > 0 and vague_p < 0.05 else 'Vagueness significantly decreases Series A funding' if vague_coef < 0 and vague_p < 0.05 else 'No significant effect of vagueness on Series A funding'}")
```

## H2: Growth (Logistic Regression with Architecture Moderator)

### Model Specification

**Research Question**: Does vagueness predict Series B+ progression, and is this moderated by integration cost (architecture)?

$$
P(\text{growth} = 1) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot z_{\text{vagueness}} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{is\_hardware} + \beta_3 \cdot (z_{\text{vagueness}} \times \text{is\_hardware}) + \text{controls})
$$

**Where**:
- $\beta_1$: Main effect of vagueness (in software/modular startups)
- $\beta_3$: Interaction effect (attenuation/amplification in hardware/integrated startups)
- **Expected**: $\beta_3 < 0$ (negative interaction: vagueness helps more in software)

### Results

```{python}
#| label: h2-results
#| tbl-cap: "H2 Coefficients: Growth × Architecture (Logit)"
print("#### Coefficient Table\n")
print(h2_arch_coef.to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".4f"))

print("\n#### Model Fit Metrics\n")
print(h2_arch_metrics.to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".4f"))

print("\n#### Average Marginal Effects\n")
print(h2_arch_ame.to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".4f"))

# Extract interaction
h2_int = h2_arch_coef[h2_arch_coef['variable'].str.contains('vagueness.*hardware', case=False, regex=True, na=False)]
if len(h2_int) > 0:
    int_coef = h2_int['coefficient'].values[0]
    int_p = h2_int['p_value'].values[0]
    int_ci_lower = h2_int['ci_lower'].values[0] if 'ci_lower' in h2_int.columns else np.nan
    int_ci_upper = h2_int['ci_upper'].values[0] if 'ci_upper' in h2_int.columns else np.nan

    print(f"\n**Interaction Effect**:")
    print(f"- Coefficient: {int_coef:.4f} (95% CI: [{int_ci_lower:.4f}, {int_ci_upper:.4f}])")
    print(f"- p-value: {int_p:.4f}")
    print(f"- Interpretation: {'Negative interaction confirms integration cost hypothesis - vagueness benefits software more than hardware' if int_coef < 0 and int_p < 0.10 else 'Positive interaction (unexpected) - vagueness benefits hardware more' if int_coef > 0 and int_p < 0.10 else 'No significant interaction - integration cost does not moderate vagueness effect'}")
```

### Interaction Plot

![H2 Interaction: Growth × Architecture](outputs/bakeoff/h2_interaction_is_hardware.png)

**Figure Interpretation**: The interaction plot shows predicted probabilities of Series B+ progression as a function of vagueness for hardware vs. software startups. **Diverging slopes** indicate strong moderation by integration cost, while parallel lines suggest weak interaction.

**Visual Assessment**:
```{python}
#| label: visual-assessment
if len(h2_int) > 0:
    int_coef = h2_int['coefficient'].values[0]
    int_p = h2_int['p_value'].values[0]

    if abs(int_coef) > 0.5 and int_p < 0.10:
        print("✓ **Strong interaction**: Clear slope differentiation visible in plot")
    elif abs(int_coef) > 0.2 and int_p < 0.10:
        print("○ **Moderate interaction**: Some slope differentiation visible")
    else:
        print("✗ **Weak/no interaction**: Slopes appear parallel or overlapping")
```

# H3/H4: Architecture Moderator for Early Funding & Growth

## Conceptual Framework

While H2 tests the architecture moderator for growth outcomes, H3 and H4 would extend this moderator to **both** dependent variables:

### H3: Early Funding × Architecture (OLS)

**Research Question**: Does integration cost moderate the vagueness → Series A funding relationship?

**Model Specification**:
$$
\text{early\_funding\_musd} \sim z_{\text{vagueness}} * \text{is\_hardware} + \text{z\_employees\_log} + C(\text{founding\_cohort}) + C(\text{sector\_fe})
$$

**Expected Pattern**:
- **Main effect** ($\beta_1$): Positive for software (vagueness increases funding)
- **Interaction** ($\beta_3$): Negative (attenuation for hardware - investors demand clarity due to capital intensity)

**Interpretation**: Hardware startups may face **earlier scrutiny** on technical feasibility and market application, making vague positioning costly even at Series A.

### H4: Growth × Architecture (Logistic Regression)

**Research Question**: Does integration cost moderate the vagueness → Series B+ progression relationship?

**Model Specification**:
$$
P(\text{growth} = 1) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot z_{\text{vagueness}} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{is\_hardware} + \beta_3 \cdot (z_{\text{vagueness}} \times \text{is\_hardware}) + \text{controls})
$$

**Expected Pattern**:
- **Main effect** ($\beta_1$): Negative for software (vagueness hurts growth)
- **Interaction** ($\beta_3$): Negative (amplification for hardware - compounding risks)

**Interpretation**: By Series B+, hardware startups with unclear positioning face **double jeopardy**: product-market fit uncertainty PLUS technical execution risk. Software can tolerate more ambiguity during scaling.

## Implementation Status

```{python}
#| label: h3-h4-status
print("""
**H3/H4 with is_hardware moderator**:

📋 **Status**: Conceptually defined, implementation pending

**Next Steps**:
1. Extend `test_h3_early_funding_interaction()` in `models.py` to accept `moderator` parameter
2. Extend `test_h4_growth_interaction()` in `models.py` to accept `moderator` parameter
3. Update `fig_founder_interactions()` in `plots.py` to `fig_moderator_interactions()` (generic)
4. Re-run pipeline with `moderator='is_hardware'` flag

**Expected Timeline**: Can be implemented within 1-2 days once data access is restored.

**Theoretical Priority**:
- If **H2 (architecture) shows strong interaction**, H3/H4 (architecture) become high priority for within-moderator consistency check
- If **H2 (architecture) shows weak interaction**, may prioritize alternative moderators (e.g., founder credibility)
