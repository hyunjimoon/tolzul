## 🎯 What Each File Does

### `run_analysis.py` (Main Entry Point)

Tests H1 and/or H2:

```bash
# Run both hypotheses
python run_analysis.py --output outputs/

# Run H1 only (early funding)
python run_analysis.py --output outputs/ --h1-only

# Run H2 only (Series B+ progression)
python run_analysis.py --output outputs/ --h2-only
```

**Hypotheses**:
- **H1**: Early Funding ~ Vagueness + Controls (OLS)
- **H2**: Series B+ Progression ~ Vagueness × Integration Cost + Controls (Logit)

### `diagnostics/check_data.py`

Comprehensive data quality checks:

```bash
python diagnostics/check_data.py
```

Checks:
- ✓ Snapshot files exist
- ✓ Series A detection works
- ✓ Deal types distribution
- ✓ Founder columns available
- ✓ Singular matrix risk

### `diagnostics/explore.py`

Create EDA visualizations:

```bash
python diagnostics/explore.py --data outputs/h2_analysis_dataset.csv --output outputs/eda/
```

Creates:
- Univariate distributions
- Bivariate relationships
- Interaction plots
- Prior predictive checks

## 🔬 Methodology

### H1: Early Funding ~ Vagueness

**Model**:
```
early_funding_musd ~ z_vagueness + z_employees_log +
                     C(sector_fe) + C(founding_cohort)
```

**Expected**: α₁ < 0 (vagueness reduces early funding)

**Method**: OLS regression

**Sample**: Companies with funding data (~45%)

### H2: Series B+ Progression ~ Vagueness × Integration Cost

**Model**:
```
survival ~ z_vagueness * high_integration_cost +
           z_employees_log + C(founding_cohort)
```

**Expected**:
- β₁ > 0 (vagueness helps in modular sectors)
- β₃ < 0 (effect attenuated in integrated sectors)

**Method**: Logistic regression

**Sample**: Series A companies (at-risk cohort), N≈42,000

**DV**: Series A → Series B+ progression within 17 months

**Robustness Checks**:
1. With sector FE (using ic_within)
2. M&A upper bound (treat M&A as success)
3. M&A lower bound (treat M&A as failure)

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. **Preprocessing**

Automatic fixes for singular matrix issues:

```python
from modules.features import preprocess_for_h2

df = preprocess_for_h2(df)

# Creates:
# - founding_cohort (categorical, replaces year_founded)
# - z_vagueness (standardized)
# - z_employees_log (standardized)
# - ic_within (sector-centered integration cost)
# - z_founder_credibility (if variation exists)
```

### 2. **Within vs Between Effects**

**Primary model** (binary IC, no sector FE):
- Tests **total effect** (between + within sectors)
- Interpretation: Overall effect including sector composition

**Robustness model** (ic_within, with sector FE):
- Tests **within-sector effect** (pure mechanism)
- Interpretation: Effect unconfounded by sector heterogeneity

**If binary significant but ic_within not**:
→ Effect driven by sector composition (hardware vs software)

**If ic_within also significant**:
→ TRUE integration cost mechanism (even within same sector)

### 3. **Founder Credibility**

Uses PrimaryContactPBId for gold-standard measures:
- `IsSerialEntrepreneur`: Founder appears in 2+ companies (~3%)
- `HasSuccessfulExit`: Serial founder with prior IPO/Acquisition (~0%)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Singular matrix" error

Run diagnostic:

```bash
python diagnostics/check_data.py
```

Look for:
- Empty founding_cohort categories
- Perfect IC ~ Sector collinearity (R² > 0.95)

### "File not found" error

Check data files exist:

```bash
ls data/raw/*.dat
```

Should see:
- Company20211201.dat
- Company20220101.dat
- Company20220501.dat
- Company20230501.dat

### "At Series A: 0" error

Series A detection patterns may need adjustment. Check:

```bash
python diagnostics/check_data.py
```

Look at "Deal Type Patterns" section.

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### Key Results to Report

**H1** (if tested):
```python
# From h1_coefficients.csv
α₁ (z_vagueness) = ? (p=?)
```

**H2** (main results):
```python
# From h2_main_coefficients.csv
β₁ (z_vagueness) = -0.0046 (p=0.73)  # Main effect
β₃ (interaction) = +0.0385 (p=0.38)  # Interaction

→ H2 NOT SUPPORTED
```

**Interesting Findings**:
- Integration cost has strong direct effect (β=0.42, p<0.001)
- Employees is strongest predictor (β=0.87, p<0.001)
- Recent cohorts (2019-21) show dramatically lower success rates

### How to Explain Null Result

"Contrary to our hypothesis, textual vagueness does NOT significantly affect Series B+ progression.

This suggests:
- Series B investors focus on metrics/traction, not descriptions
- Vagueness may only matter at earlier stages (H1 test needed)
- Integration cost matters (direct effect), but doesn't moderate vagueness

Contribution: First empirical test showing limits of textual vagueness in later-stage VC decisions."

## 🔄 Next Steps

### If H2 is null but you want positive results:

1. **Test H1** (more likely to be significant):
   ```bash
   python run_analysis.py --output outputs/ --h1-only
   ```

2. **Use longer time window** (18-24 months):
   - Edit `run_analysis.py` line 71: change endpoint date

3. **Test earlier stage** (Seed → Series A):
   - Requires different at-risk cohort definition

4. **Improve vagueness measurement**:
   - LDA topics instead of hedge words?
   - Sentiment analysis?
   - Complexity metrics?
