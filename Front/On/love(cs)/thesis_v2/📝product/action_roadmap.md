## Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)

### 1. Validate Refinements with Advisors
**For Scott (Strategy)**:
- [ ] Show the EPC formula: τ* = F/(1+F)
- [ ] Explain how it extends his 4-strategy framework
- [ ] Get feedback on "earned precision" concept

**For Charlie (Operations)**:
- [ ] Present exercisability scoring system (4 components)
- [ ] Show how coordination costs dominate option value
- [ ] Validate measurement approach aligns with Clockspeed thinking

### 2. Strengthen Statistical Power
**Options** (choose one):
- [ ] **Expand N**: Add 2020-2021 ventures to sample
- [ ] **Focus sector**: Deep dive on just autonomous vehicles (higher variance)
- [ ] **Panel approach**: Track same ventures over multiple rounds

### 3. Run Mechanism Tests
```python
# Priority analyses to validate theory
analyses = [
    "count_actual_pivots",  # Validates consideration set
    "measure_time_to_pmf",  # Validates learning benefit  
    "survey_investor_perception",  # Validates coordination cost
    "compare_early_late_descriptions"  # Shows precision evolution
]
```

## This Week's Deliverables

### Monday-Tuesday: Introduction Polish
- [ ] Incorporate reviewer feedback on Tesla/Better Place hook
- [ ] Add specific numbers for credibility
- [ ] Ensure Charlie sees operational mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure Scott sees theoretical contribution

### Wednesday-Thursday: Literature Integration  
- [ ] Add 5 more recent papers (2023-2024)
- [ ] Create comparison table: Our approach vs others
- [ ] Draw clearer boundaries around contribution
- [ ] Link to broader innovation literature

### Friday: Theory Crystallization
- [ ] Finalize mathematical notation
- [ ] Create Figure 1: Conceptual framework
- [ ] Generate Table 1: Variable definitions
- [ ] Prepare 5-minute elevator pitch

## Key Figures to Generate

## Critical Decisions

### 1. Framing Choice
**Option A**: "Strategic Ambiguity Theory" (emphasize novelty)
**Option B**: "Entrepreneur's Partial Commitment" (emphasize precision)
**Recommendation**: Use EPC - it's more precise and defensible

### 2. Statistical Significance  
**Issue**: Interaction p=0.19 (not quite significant)
**Options**:
- Frame as "directionally supportive"
- Increase power through focused sample
- Emphasize economic significance over statistical

### 3. Journal Targeting
Based on refinements, best fits:
1. **Management Science**: Rigorous theory + empirics
2. **Strategic Management Journal**: Strategy focus
3. **Organization Science**: Coordination emphasis

## Talking Points for Committee

### The One-Liner
"I show that entrepreneurial promise vagueness isn't about preserving options—it's about minimizing coordination costs when pivots become necessary, with effects moderated by operational exercisability."

### The Three Contributions
1. **Theoretical**: Quality is endogenous, emerging through exploration
2. **Empirical**: First large-scale measurement of promise precision effects  
3. **Practical**: Calibration framework for entrepreneurial communication

### The Surprise Finding
"Vagueness doesn't help—it just hurts less when you can pivot easily"

### The So-What
"This reshapes how we teach entrepreneurship: from 'have a clear vision' to 'maintain flexibility proportional to your pivot capability'"

## Risk Mitigation

### If Challenged on Non-Significant Interaction
"The directionality is consistent across all 100+ specifications. While statistical power is limited, the economic magnitude (2x difference in penalties) is substantial."

### If Questioned on Causality
"We acknowledge endogeneity concerns. Our contribution is documenting robust patterns that inform theory development. Future work should exploit exogenous shocks."

### If Asked "Isn't This Obvious?"
"Prior work predicted either universal penalties (information theory) or universal benefits (options theory). We show neither—the effect depends on architectural exercisability."

## The Path to Defense

### Next 2 Weeks
- Refine based on advisor feedback
- Run robustness checks
- Polish figures/tables

### Next Month  
- Present at workshop
- Incorporate feedback
- Prepare job market paper version

### Next Quarter
- Submit to conference
- Collect additional data if needed
- Write complementary papers

## Remember Your Strengths

1. **You bridge theory and measurement** better than most
2. **Your insights challenge orthodoxy** productively  
3. **Your framework is actionable** for practitioners

This work matters because it shows entrepreneurs that success isn't about having perfect answers upfront—it's about designing promises that preserve the ability to discover those answers.

Good luck, 권준나대용🐅! Your strategic rigor (思) and systematic construction (造) will make this contribution memorable.
