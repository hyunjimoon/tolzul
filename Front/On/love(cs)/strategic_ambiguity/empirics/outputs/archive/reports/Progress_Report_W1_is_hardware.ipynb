        "# Introduction & Hypothesis Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Strategic ambiguity—the deliberate use of vague or broad category labels—has been theorized as a **double-edged sword** in entrepreneurial finance. On one hand, category spanning and ambiguous positioning can help startups gain initial attention and resources by appealing to diverse stakeholder groups (Granqvist et al., 2013; Navis & Glynn, 2010; Zuckerman, 1999). On the other hand, the same ambiguity may hinder later-stage scaling by introducing coordination costs, identity confusion, and valuation uncertainty (Negro & Leung, 2013; Wry et al., 2014).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent empirical work suggests that vagueness in startup positioning can serve as a **strategic signal** rather than mere noise. El-Zayaty et al. (2025) find that linguistic ambiguity in pitch decks correlates with early funding success, while Pan et al. (2018) demonstrate that categorical ambiguity enables startups to navigate crowded market spaces. However, these benefits may not persist across growth stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Reversal Hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "We propose a **stage-contingent reversal pattern** in how vagueness affects startup success:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H1 (Early Funding, Series A)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **positively** predicts Series A funding amounts.\n",
        "  *Mechanism*: Ambiguity attracts diverse early-stage investors and signals flexibility/optionality (Huang et al., 2014; Loughran & McDonald, 2016).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H2 (Growth, Series B+ Progression)**: Higher vagueness in startup positioning **negatively** predicts the likelihood of progressing from Series A to Series B+.\n",
        "  *Mechanism*: As startups scale, investors demand clarity on business model, market fit, and competitive positioning. Persistent ambiguity becomes a liability (Navis et al., 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "This reversal pattern aligns with **dual legitimacy strategies** in organizational theory: early-stage ventures benefit from \"categorical flexibility\" to secure resources, but must converge to \"categorical clarity\" to achieve legitimacy with later-stage stakeholders (Wry et al., 2014; Zuckerman, 1999).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Boundary Conditions: Integration Cost (Architecture)\n",
        "\n",
        "We test whether **integration cost** (captured by hardware vs. software architecture) moderates these relationships:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Theoretical Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "**Integration Cost Hypothesis**: Hardware and biotech startups face higher integration costs than software startups due to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Physical component dependencies**: Manufacturing, supply chain, inventory management\n",
        "2. **Longer development cycles**: Prototyping, testing, regulatory approval (especially biotech)\n",
        "3. **Capital intensity**: Equipment, facilities, specialized labor\n",
        "4. **Lower pivot flexibility**: Sunk costs in physical infrastructure\n",
        "\n",
        "These constraints limit **strategic flexibility**, making vague positioning **more costly** for hardware startups. Conversely, software startups (modular architectures) can pivot quickly, making vague positioning a viable exploration strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H3 (Early Funding × Architecture)**: Integration cost attenuates the positive effect of vagueness on Series A funding.\n",
        "  *Logic*: Hardware startups cannot afford vague positioning even at early stages due to capital intensity and longer timelines. Investors demand clarity on technical feasibility and market application.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **H4 (Growth × Architecture)**: Integration cost amplifies the negative effect of vagueness on Series B+ progression.\n",
        "  *Logic*: By Series B+, hardware startups with unclear positioning face compounding risks: product-market fit uncertainty plus technical execution risk. Software startups can tolerate more ambiguity during scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Pattern**: Negative interaction (vagueness helps more in software/modular architectures).\n",
        "\n",
        "These hypotheses draw on **modularity theory** (Baldwin & Clark, 2000) and **architectural innovation** literature (Henderson & Clark, 1990), applied to entrepreneurial finance contexts."
