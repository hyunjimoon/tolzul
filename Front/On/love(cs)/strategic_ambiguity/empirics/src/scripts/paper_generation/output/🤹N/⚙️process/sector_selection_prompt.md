# Research Sector Selection: Space Technology vs Autonomous Driving

## My Research Context

I'm a PhD student at MIT Sloan developing a three-paper dissertation on **"Strategic Ambiguity in Entrepreneurship."** I need to select ONE primary industry to empirically test my hypotheses. Help me choose between **Space Technology** and **Autonomous Driving**.

## My Three Papers and Hypotheses

### Paper U: "Vague Promise and Venture Growth" (U-shape)
**Hypothesis**: Venture success follows a U-shaped relationship with promise vagueness (V)
- V ≈ 0 (Precise): Analyst channel success (verify concrete claims)
- V ≈ 0.5 (Murky): Dual threshold failure (neither channel works)
- V ≈ 1 (Vague): Believer channel success (project own vision)

**Ideal sector characteristics for testing**:
- Wide range of vagueness across companies (some precise, some visionary)
- Clear success/failure outcomes observable
- Both Analyst-type and Believer-type investors active
- Enough companies at each V level for statistical power

### Paper C: "The Commitment Trap" (Bayesian Trap)
**Hypothesis**: Higher initial optimism leads to lower pivot probability
- Early believers → Precision increases → Learning capacity decreases → Pivot impossible

**Ideal sector characteristics for testing**:
- Observable commitment decisions (technology lock-in, infrastructure investment)
- Clear pivot vs. non-pivot outcomes
- Variation in founder optimism levels
- Long enough time horizon to observe trap dynamics

### Paper N: "The FOMO Dilemma" (Newsvendor of Options)
**Hypothesis**: Pure strategy (single audience) outperforms mixture strategy (blended)
- Targeting both Analyst AND Believer → Bimodal demand → Suboptimal outcomes

**Ideal sector characteristics for testing**:
- Companies with varying audience targeting strategies
- Observable "option portfolio" decisions
- Both pure-play and diversified companies exist

## Evaluation Criteria

For each sector, please analyze:

### 1. Data Availability (Weight: 30%)
- Funding data quality (amounts, rounds, investors)
- Company outcome data (IPO, acquisition, failure, pivot)
- Promise/communication data (pitches, announcements, PR)
- Time series length (10+ years ideal)

### 2. Variation in Vagueness (Weight: 25%)
- Are there clear examples of V≈0, V≈0.5, V≈1 companies?
- Is the full spectrum represented?
- Can vagueness be measured objectively?

### 3. Commitment Trap Observability (Weight: 20%)
- Are there clear "trapped" companies (high investment, failed to pivot)?
- Are there contrast cases (similar tech, different outcomes)?
- Is commitment irreversibility clear (infrastructure, tech choice)?

### 4. Investor Type Diversity (Weight: 15%)
- Are both Analyst and Believer investor types active?
- Are investor preferences observable (portfolio patterns)?
- Are there specialist vs. generalist investors?

### 5. Academic & Practical Relevance (Weight: 10%)
- Existing academic literature to build on?
- Industry interest in the findings?
- Generalizability to other sectors?

## Output Format Requested

|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| U (Vagueness) | ? | ? | ? |
| C (Commitment) | Escaped trap | Trapped | ? |
| N (Pure vs Mix) | Pure Analyst | Mixture | Pure Believer |

#### D. Data Sources
- Primary databases (Crunchbase, PitchBook equivalents)
- Specialized trackers (e.g., Space Capital for space)
- Academic datasets available

### Final Recommendation
- Which sector do you recommend and why?
- What are the main risks of each choice?
- Is a hybrid approach (both sectors) feasible?

## Additional Context

### Space Sector Resources
- Space Capital quarterly reports track funding, IPOs, companies
- Sectors include: Launch, Satellites, Earth Observation, Space Infrastructure

### Autonomous Driving Resources  
- Clear failure cases exist: Argo AI ($3.6B), Embark, Starsky
- Success spectrum: Mobileye (V≈0) → Waymo (V≈1)
- Subsectors: ADAS, L2-L5 autonomy, Maritime, Aviation, Ground

## My Constraints
- PhD timeline: Need to complete by 2026
- Advisor expertise: Operations Management (Charlie Fine) + Strategy/Entrepreneurship (Scott Stern)
- Existing dataset: PitchBook access with 51,840 ventures (general)
- Language: Some Korean startup data available if needed

Please provide a thorough comparative analysis to help me make this decision.

# Industry Research: Space Tech vs Autonomous Driving for Academic Study

## Research Question
Which industry—Space Technology or Autonomous Driving—provides better empirical conditions to study entrepreneurial promise strategies and their relationship to venture outcomes?

## Specific Data Needs

### 1. Funding Landscape (2015-2024)

For each sector, please provide:
- Total VC funding by year
- Number of funded startups
- Average round sizes by stage (Seed, A, B, C+)
- Notable exits (IPO, M&A, Failures)

### 2. Company Spectrum Examples

I need companies across a "precision spectrum":

| Type | Description | Space Example? | AV Example? |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Precise (V≈0)** | Specific product, clear metrics | ? | Mobileye? |
| **Middle (V≈0.5)** | Neither specific nor visionary | ? | Better Place? |
| **Visionary (V≈1)** | Grand vision, flexible path | ? | Tesla? |

### 3. Failure Cases for "Commitment Trap" Study

I need companies that:
- Raised significant funding ($50M+)
- Had strong technology conviction
- Failed to pivot when market signals appeared
- Eventually shut down or sold for parts

### 4. Investor Type Analysis

For each sector:
- Who are the "Analyst" investors? (focus on metrics, unit economics)
- Who are the "Believer" investors? (focus on vision, transformation)
- Are there specialists vs. generalists?

### 5. Data Source Quality

| Data Type | Space Sector Source | AV Sector Source | Quality |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Funding | Space Capital | Pitchbook/CB | ? |
| Outcomes | ? | ? | ? |
| Promises | Press releases? | ? | ? |

## Specific Questions

1. **Space Sector**:
   - How mature is the failure data? (Are there enough shut-down companies to study?)
   - What's the typical timeline from founding to outcome (success/failure)?
   - Are "pivot" events observable and documented?

2. **Autonomous Driving**:
   - Is the sector too concentrated (few large players) for statistical analysis?
   - Are subsectors (maritime, aviation, trucking) distinct enough to treat separately?
   - How much overlap exists with general "mobility" or "EV" sectors?

3. **Comparative**:
   - Which sector has clearer "commitment irreversibility"? (e.g., satellites in space, infrastructure in AV)
   - Which has more diverse investor types?
   - Which has more public documentation of company strategies/pivots?

## Recent Events to Consider (2023-2024)

Please include recent developments:
- Major Space failures or successes in 2024
- AV sector consolidation (Cruise issues, Waymo progress, etc.)
- Any notable pivots in either sector

## Output Format
