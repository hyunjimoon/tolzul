### Core Theoretical Foundation: Real Options × Core Rigidity × Bayesian Learning

---

## 2.1 Capabilities as Real Options

**Kogut & Kulatilaka (2001)** reconceptualize capabilities as real options. Capabilities have value because they create options for future strategic moves. However, this view underspecifies when options become **unexercisable**.

## 2.2 Core Rigidity and the Success Trap

**Leonard-Barton (1992)** introduced core rigidity: the same capabilities that drive success become liabilities when environments shift. **Henderson & Clark (1990)** showed architectural innovation disrupts incumbents not through superior components but through new linkages.

**However**, these frameworks don't explain why startups — supposedly nimble — fall into the same trap.

## 2.3 Bayesian Learning and Belief Lock-in

We propose a Bayesian mechanism: Early success generates high μ, low σ priors about the current path. Like-minded investors reinforce these beliefs. The posterior update threshold rises, making pivots increasingly unlikely even as evidence mounts.

**Key insight**: The trap is not technical but **epistemic**. Founders and boards converge on shared beliefs that make alternative evidence dismissible.

## 2.4 Conceptual Framework: Belief-Reinforcing Capital Structures

```
Early Commitment → High Performance → Believer Investors
       ↓                                      ↓
  Low σ Priors ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Reinforced Beliefs
       ↓
  High Switching Threshold
       ↓
  Unexercisable Pivot Options
```

## 2.5 Hypothesis Development

**H1: High initial commitment → reduced pivot probability**

Mechanism: Commitment creates sunk costs and organizational inertia.

**H2: Like-minded investor composition → higher switching threshold**

Mechanism: Like-minded boards raise evidence threshold for pivots.

**H3: Technology paradigm shift amplifies commitment penalty**

Mechanism: Paradigm shifts reveal trap severity.

**Key Variables:**
- Commitment Level
- Cap Table Composition
- Switching Cost (C)
- Paradigm Shift Indicator

## Cross-Synthesis: Theoretical Integration

### How P1, P2, P3 Connect

```
P1 (U-Shape)                P3 (Newsvendor)               P2 (Competency Trap)
    ↓                            ↓                             ↓
Modularity determines    CR = C/(C+F) determines      Success raises switching
when vagueness pays      optimal option count         threshold
    ↓                            ↓                             ↓
    └──────────────── UNIFIED FRAMEWORK ───────────────────────┘
                              ↓
              Options have architecture.
              Value depends on cost structure.
```

### Shared Theoretical Foundation

All three papers share:
1. **Real Options Logic**: Strategic choices create/destroy option value
2. **Contingency View**: No universally optimal strategy
3. **Architecture Matters**: Technology/organization structure determines flexibility value

### Where They Diverge

| Dimension | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Focus | Communication | Learning | Portfolio |
| Key Moderator | Modularity | Cap Table | CR Ratio |
| Prescription | Go extreme | Keep doubters | Calibrate |
