## 🟡 Limitations to Acknowledge (from N01, N02)

### Limitation: Revealed vs. Intended Optionality

**From N01 (Asset Specificity)**:
- |ΔV| captures *revealed* strategy change, not *intended* optionality
- A founder may intend flexibility but be locked in by specific promises

**Future Work Direction**:
> "Our measure captures ex-post flexibility (|ΔV|). Future research should examine ex-ante optionality intentions through founder interviews or pitch deck analysis."

### Limitation: k* Empirical Operationalization

**From N02 (Loch et al.)**:
- Paper N derives optimal k* theoretically
- Empirical validation requires observable proxies for k

**Potential Proxies**:
| Proxy | Data Source | Feasibility |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| # of market segments mentioned | Pitch decks | Medium |
| # of use cases listed | Crunchbase descriptions | High |
| Product pivot count | Archive.org snapshots | Medium |
