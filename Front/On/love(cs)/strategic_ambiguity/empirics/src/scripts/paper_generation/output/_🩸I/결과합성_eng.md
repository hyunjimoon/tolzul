## 1. Executive Summary

This document describes the **process** I used to identify role model papers for my three-paper dissertation on "Flexibility and Commitment in Entrepreneurship." I seek feedback on whether this methodology adequately positions my work within the strategic entrepreneurship conversation.

**Core Question for You**: Is my process for selecting templates and constructing H0-H1 pairs rigorous enough to pass the "70% rule"—where 70% of the paper's value comes from correct framing?

---

## 2. The Search Process

### 2.1 Step 1: Define the Target Conversation

I identified the **Stern-Nanda-Gans school** as my primary intellectual community, characterized by:

| Dimension | Traditional Entrepreneurship | Strategic Turn (2015-2024) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Question | "What do founders do?" | "Why is that choice optimal?" |
| Method | Small-N case studies | Large-N or RCT |
| Framing | Success/failure binary | Experimentation & option value |

**Rationale**: My advisors (Fine, Stern) sit at this intersection. Papers published in MS/SMJ by this group define what "good work" looks like for my audience.

### 2.2 Step 2: Establish Selection Criteria

For each template paper, I required:

1. **Venue Match**: Management Science or SMJ (my target journals)
2. **Structural Similarity**: Uses Horse-race design (H0 vs H1)
3. **Network Proximity**: Authors within 2 degrees of my advisors
4. **Recency**: Published 2017-2024 (demonstrates current conversation)

### 2.3 Step 3: Search Method

| Source | Query Strategy | Papers Reviewed |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Claude Extended Search | "entrepreneurship + signaling + MS/SMJ + 2017-2024" | ~30 papers |
| Gemini Deep Research | "strategic ambiguity + venture funding + operations" | ~25 papers |
| Advisor Suggestions | Direct recommendations from Fine, Stern | 8 papers |
| Cross-referencing | Citations within top candidates | ~15 papers |

**Total papers reviewed**: ~78  
**Final templates selected**: 9 (3 per paper)

---

## 3. Template Selection by Paper

### 3.1 Paper U: "Promise Precision and Venture Funding"

**My Hypothesis Structure**:
- H0: "Clearer signals improve funding success" (Spence 1973)
- H1: "U-shaped relationship—extreme clarity OR ambiguity outperforms middle"

**Selected Templates**:

| Rank | Paper | Why Selected | What I'll Borrow |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Camuffo et al. (2020) MS | Gold standard for Horse-race RCT design | H0(trial-error) vs H1(scientific) structure |
| 2 | Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf (2017) MS | Proves non-linear/conditional relationships | "Financing risk operates differently at extremes" |
| 3 | Agrawal, Gans, Stern (2021) MS | Direct network connection; Signal Conflation concept | One signal, multiple interpretations framework |

**Methodological Support**: Haans et al. (2016) SMJ for U-shape testing protocol

**Question for Hart**: Is Camuffo's RCT structure appropriate as a template even though my study is observational (N=488,381)? Or should I prioritize Guzman & Stern (2020) which uses large-N prediction?

---

### 3.2 Paper C: "Commitment Trap and Belief Homogenization"

**My Hypothesis Structure**:
- H0: "More resources (early funding) lead to better outcomes" (Barney 1991)
- H1: "Early success destroys option value by homogenizing beliefs"

**Selected Templates**:

| Rank | Paper | Why Selected | What I'll Borrow |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Camuffo et al. (2020) MS | "Confirmatory search → lock-in" mechanism | Scientific approach prevents commitment trap |
| 2 | Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf (2017) MS | "Resources can destroy option value" logic | Upfront funding → abandonment option loss |
| 3 | Gans, Stern, Wu (2019) SMJ | Theorizes "cost of commitment" | "Commitment-free analysis yields alternatives" |

**Question for Hart**: My mechanism (belief homogenization → σ collapse) is novel. Should I anchor more heavily on Leonard-Barton (1992) "core rigidity" or develop the Bayesian framing as the primary theoretical contribution?

---

### 3.3 Paper N: "Promise Vendor Model"

**My Hypothesis Structure** (In Progress):
- H0 Candidate: "More options are always better" (McGrath 1999)
- H1: "Optimal k* exists where k* = F_D⁻¹(CR); too many options = flexibility cost"

**Selected Templates**:

| Rank | Paper | Why Selected | What I'll Borrow |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Olivares, Terwiesch, Cassorla (2008) MS | Newsvendor structural estimation | Critical fractile formula, cost parameter estimation |
| 2 | Agrawal, Gans, Stern (2021) MS | Formal model → entrepreneurship application | Uncertainty in strategic choice modeling |
| 3 | Ceccagnoli, Higgins, Kang (2018) SMJ | Real options + empirical calibration | Option value drivers, exercise decision analysis |

**Question for Hart**: My H0 is weakest here. Three candidates I'm considering:

| H0 Option | Strength | Weakness |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "Founders behave newsvendor-optimal" | Clean benchmark | Too technical for strategy audience |
| "Historical data enables demand estimation" | Operations grounding | Doesn't engage strategy literature |
| "More options = better" (McGrath) | Engages real options debate | McGrath might be too dated (1999) |

Which H0 would you recommend for an SMJ submission?

## 4. Cross-Paper Integration

### 4.1 Citation Architecture

I've organized citations into three tiers:

| Tier | Function | Papers U, C, N |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Canonical** | "My tribe" declaration | Spence (1973), Barney (1991), McGrath (1999) |
| **Recent** | "I'm in the current conversation" | Gans-Stern-Wu (2019), Nanda-RK (2017), Camuffo (2020) |
| **Specialized** | "My unique contribution" | Haans (2016), Leonard-Barton (1992), Olivares (2008) |

### 4.2 Introduction Structure

All three papers follow the same 7-paragraph blueprint:

| ¶ | Role | Content |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1-2 | Gospel | "A central tenet is..." (H0) |
| 3 | Puzzle | "However, [phenomenon] challenges..." |
| 4 | Lens | "We posit that [mechanism]..." |
| 5 | Solution | "Using [method], we find..." |
| 6 | Positioning | "Unlike [closest paper], we..." |
| 7 | Contribution | "Our findings contribute to..." |

**Question for Hart**: Is this structure too formulaic? Should I differentiate the introduction styles across the three papers?

---

## 5. Validation Checkpoints

### 5.1 Internal Validation

| Criterion | Paper U | Paper C | Paper N |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| H0 is audience's actual prior | ✓ Spence widely accepted | ✓ RBV is canonical | ? McGrath's status unclear |
| H1 extends (not replaces) H0 | ✓ "Conditions under which" | ✓ Identifies trap | ✓ Finds optimal k* |
| Method matches template | ? Observational vs RCT | ✓ Follows Nanda | ✓ Structural estimation |
| Network proximity exists | ✓ Stern is co-author | ✓ Gans connection | ? Weaker link |

### 5.2 External Validation Sought

| Validator | What I Need |
|:---|:---|
| **Hart Posen** | Process critique: Is this search method rigorous? |
| **Matt Cronin** | Math-language correspondence check |
| **Charlie Fine** | Operations validity of newsvendor extension |
| **Scott Stern** | Strategy positioning within his research program |

## 6. Specific Questions for Hart

### On Process:

1. **Template Selection**: Did I weight the right criteria? Should "author network" matter less than "structural similarity"?

2. **H0 Construction**: Is anchoring H0 on classic papers (Spence 1973, Barney 1991) too safe? Should I engage more recent priors?

3. **Cross-Paper Coherence**: The three papers share the same introduction structure. Is this a feature (coherent dissertation) or bug (repetitive)?

### On Positioning:

4. **"Conditions Under Which" Framing**: All three papers use this approach. Is this appropriate, or should at least one paper take a stronger "replacement" stance?

5. **Dual Audience Problem**: My advisors have different priorities (Fine: operational rigor; Stern: strategic clarity). How do I satisfy both without diluting the contribution?
