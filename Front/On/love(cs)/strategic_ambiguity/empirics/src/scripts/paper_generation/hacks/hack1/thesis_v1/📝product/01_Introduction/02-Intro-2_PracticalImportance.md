Online grocery retail has rapidly evolved from a fledgling concept into a major force in the grocery industry. Early ventures, such as Webvan in the late 1990s, introduced the idea of digital grocery shopping but struggled to achieve lasting success (CNN 1999). However, as technology advanced and consumer preferences shifted, the sector gained renewed momentum. The growth of online grocery shopping accelerated sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, with U.S. online grocery sales increasing by 131% to reach $97.7 billion in 2021, accounting for more than 12% of all grocery sales (Capital One Shopping 2022, Mercatus 2022). This trend has continued even as pandemic restrictions have eased; in 2022, 47% of U.S. consumers continued to purchase groceries online. This trend prompted retailer giants, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Costco, to actively expand their online grocery operations (The Wall Street Journal 2017, Walmart 2019).
