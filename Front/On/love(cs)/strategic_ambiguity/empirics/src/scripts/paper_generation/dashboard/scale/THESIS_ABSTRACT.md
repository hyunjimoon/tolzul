# Title: The Promise Vendor: Strategic Ambiguity and the Capital-Flexibility Paradox in Deep-Tech Ventures

**Abstract**:
Silicon Valley orthodoxy teaches that "Focus plus Capital equals Success." This dissertation challenges that mantra, revealing a **"Wealth Paradox"** in high-uncertainty sectors: while early capital ($E$) signals validation, it simultaneously crystallizes into a **"Golden Cage"** of rigidity, destroying the venture's option to pivot. Using a comprehensive dataset of **488,381 ventures** and a novel text-based measure of **Strategic Ambiguity ($V$)**, I demonstrate that the survival of deep-tech ventures depends not on the rapid completion of a product ($k=1$), but on the optimization of a portfolio of real options ($k^*$).

This thesis unfolds across three pillars. **Paper 1 (The Signal)** establishes the **U-shaped relationship** between vagueness and growth ($p < 0.001$). Contrary to the belief that precision is always superior, I find that ventures succeed by adopting extreme positions—either satisfying **"Analyst"** investors with high precision or **"Believer"** investors with high ambiguity—while the **"Murky Middle"** consistently fails. **Paper 2 (The Trap)** identifies the causal mechanism of failure: **Abandonment Option Cost (AOC)**. Analyzing a panel of 180,000 ventures, I show that early funding acts as "concrete" rather than fuel, creating an **8.8x growth gap** between flexible ventures ("Escape Velocity") and rigid ones ("Golden Cage"). Finally, **Paper 3 (The Solution)** proposes the **"Promise Vendor Model."** By adapting the Newsvendor framework to information economics ($k^* = F^{-1}(CR)$), I prove that in deep-tech environments where the cost of under-commitment ($C_u$) exceeds the cost of over-commitment ($C_o$), the optimal strategy is to maintain a calculated level of ambiguity, effectively selling the "right to pivot" rather than a fixed product.

Collectively, these findings suggest a fundamental shift in strategy: for deep-tech ventures, **wealth destroys options**, and **ambiguity preserves them**. The winning strategy is not to buy focus, but to sell the option to wait.
