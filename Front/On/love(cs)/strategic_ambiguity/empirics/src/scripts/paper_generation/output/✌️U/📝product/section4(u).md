## 4.1 Summary of Findings

This paper asked when vagueness is valuable despite signaling theory's precision prescription. Using data on 408,784 technology ventures across four industries, we documented a robust U-shaped relationship between promise vagueness and survival to late-stage funding. Both the most precise ventures (Q1: 5.7% survival) and the most vague ventures (Q4: 8.6% survival) outperform intermediate positioning (Q2: 2.9%, Q3: 4.0%). This pattern holds across all four industries (p < 0.001 in each case), with the "Murky Middle Penalty" ranging from 2.1 to 3.7 percentage points.

We proposed audience segmentation as the mechanism. Precise promises attract "Analyst" investors who evaluate through verification; vague promises attract "Believer" investors who evaluate through projection. Intermediate positioning fails because it activates neither evaluation mode effectively.

## 4.2 Theoretical Contributions

**Boundary conditions for signaling theory.** Our findings establish that signaling theory's precision prescription holds for verification-oriented audiences but fails for projection-oriented audiences. This implies that the theory's domain is narrower than commonly assumed. The standard advice to "be specific" is correct when targeting Analysts but counterproductive when targeting Believers.

This insight connects to growing recognition that signaling effectiveness depends on receiver characteristics (Stern and Camuffo 2021). Our contribution is to identify a specific dimension—evaluation mode—along which receivers differ, and to show that this heterogeneity generates non-monotonic effects.

**Strategic ambiguity as legitimate strategy.** Organizational communication scholars have long argued that ambiguity can serve strategic functions (Eisenberg 1984; Sillince et al. 2012). Our findings provide large-sample empirical support for this view in entrepreneurial contexts. Vagueness is not uniformly inferior to precision; under the right conditions, it can be a superior strategy.

**The importance of clear positioning.** Perhaps counterintuitively, our results emphasize the importance of commitment—not to precision per se, but to a coherent positioning strategy. The middle ground fails not because moderate vagueness is inherently problematic, but because it fails to clearly signal which evaluation mode investors should apply. The strategic implication is to choose a lane and commit.

## 4.3 Practical Implications

**For founders.** The core prescription is that vagueness is not a dial to tune but a playbook to choose. Founders should assess which investor audience they are targeting and calibrate positioning accordingly:

- If you have verifiable milestones, technical achievements, or market traction: choose the Analyst playbook. Be specific. Enable verification.
- If you have a compelling vision, transformative potential, or market-creating ambition: choose the Believer playbook. Stay abstract. Enable projection.
- If you are uncertain: clarify your audience before calibrating your message. The middle ground is the worst of both worlds.

**For investors.** Vagueness is not noise; it is signal about which evaluation mode the founder is optimizing for. Analysts should prefer precise ventures that enable their verification process. Believers should prefer vague ventures that enable their projection process. Mismatched investments—Analysts funding vague ventures, Believers funding precise ventures—may underperform because the evaluation mode that led to the investment may not be appropriate for the venture's actual development trajectory.

**For industry differences.** The Murky Middle Penalty is most severe in Transportation (+3.69pp) and least severe in Software (+2.10pp). In high-capital, high-uncertainty environments, clear positioning matters more. Founders in these contexts should be especially deliberate about choosing a lane.

## 4.4 Limitations

Several limitations warrant discussion.

**Correlational design.** We document patterns, not causation. The U-shape could reflect reverse causality (successful ventures attract resources that enable repositioning), selection (better founders choose extreme positioning), or omitted variables (characteristics correlated with both vagueness choice and outcomes). Our controls mitigate but do not eliminate these concerns.

**Mechanism inference.** We do not directly observe investor types. The Analyst/Believer distinction is interpretive. Future work should measure investor evaluation modes directly—through surveys, experiments, or analysis of investment decision processes—to validate the proposed mechanism.

**Vagueness measurement.** Our NLP-based measure captures linguistic vagueness in company descriptions. It may not capture strategic intent, and it may conflate different types of vagueness (market scope, technical specificity, value proposition clarity). Alternative operationalizations could yield different results.

**Generalizability.** Our sample comprises venture-backed technology companies from 2021-2025. The findings may not generalize to other contexts: non-technology industries, non-venture-funded companies, or different time periods.

## 4.5 Future Directions

Several avenues for future research emerge from this work.

**Experimental validation.** Field experiments that manipulate vagueness in pitch materials could establish causality. Lab experiments could identify the mechanism by measuring how different investor types respond to the same venture at different vagueness levels.

**Investor heterogeneity.** Direct measurement of investor evaluation modes would enable tests of the sorting mechanism. Do Analyst-type investors indeed prefer precise ventures? Do Believer-type investors prefer vague ones? Does matching improve outcomes?

**Dynamic analysis.** How does positioning evolve over time? Do ventures that start vague become more precise as they develop? Does early positioning constrain later flexibility? Longitudinal analysis could address these questions.

**Cross-country variation.** Investor preferences may vary across institutional contexts. Are Believer investors more prevalent in some ecosystems than others? Does the U-shape hold in venture markets outside the United States?

## 4.6 Conclusion

Strategic communication in entrepreneurship involves a fundamental trade-off between precision that enables verification and vagueness that enables projection. Signaling theory emphasizes the former; strategic ambiguity research emphasizes the latter. We show that both perspectives are correct—for different audiences.

The U-shaped relationship we document suggests that founders face a choice: target Analysts with precision, or target Believers with vision. The worst strategy is to occupy the middle ground that satisfies neither audience. Vagueness is not a dial to tune but a playbook to choose.
