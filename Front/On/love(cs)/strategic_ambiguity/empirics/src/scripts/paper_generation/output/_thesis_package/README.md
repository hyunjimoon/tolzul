## One-Page Summary

### Research Question
When do the commitments that secure early resources become constraints on long-term success?

### Core Finding
Promise precision and venture growth exhibit a **U-shaped relationship**. Both highly precise and highly vague positioning outperform intermediate positioning.

### Key Statistics

| Finding | Evidence |
|:---|:---|
| U-shape confirmed | χ² = 1430.9***, p < 0.001 |
| Flexibility → Growth | ρ = +0.159*** |
| Capital → Rigidity | ρ = -0.052*** |
| Flexibility Gap | 2.7× (Q4 vs Q1) |
| Sample Size (U) | N = 408,784 ventures |
| Sample Size (C) | N = 123,906 ventures |

### Mechanism: Golden Cage

1. **Capital requires commitment** → specific promises
2. **Commitment attracts alignment** → homogeneous stakeholders
3. **Alignment compresses variance** → σ² → 0
4. **Compressed variance blocks adaptation** → rigidity

### Prescription

**For founders**: Select channel based on CR (cost ratio):
- **Analyst channel** (CR < 0.5): Precise promises, k* ≈ 1
- **Believer channel** (CR > 0.5): Abstract vision, k* > 1
- **Never intermediate** → survival penalty of 2-4 percentage points

## Theoretical Foundation: Ghemawat (1991)

**Book**: *Commitment: The Dynamic of Strategy*

**Key Mapping**:

| Ghemawat Concept | Thesis Application |
|:---|:---|
| Lock-in via sticky assets | AOC (Abandonment Option Cost) |
| Type I vs Type II orgs | Analyst vs Believer investors |
| Flexibility value | k* = F⁻¹(CR) formula |
| Errors of omission/commission | Cu vs Co trade-off |

**Quote**: "Flexibility isn't synonymous with safety... it is an abundant store of potentially valuable revision possibilities."

## Three Papers

### Paper U: Vague Promise and Venture Growth
- **RQ**: When is vagueness valuable?
- **Finding**: U-shaped relationship; both extremes outperform middle
- **Contribution**: Boundary condition for signaling theory

### Paper C: The Commitment Trap
- **RQ**: When does capital constrain growth?
- **Finding**: Flexibility → Growth (+0.159); Capital → Rigidity (-0.052)
- **Contribution**: Quantifies commitment cost (2.7× gap)

### Paper N: The Promise Vendor
- **RQ**: How to choose optimal options?
- **Finding**: k* = F⁻¹(CR) varies by industry
- **Contribution**: Newsvendor model for strategic options

## For Discussion with Charlie

### Operations Perspective Questions

1. **Scaling mechanism**: How does the flexibility-commitment trade-off change as ventures scale?

2. **AOC measurement**: Can we develop direct measures of abandonment option cost?

3. **Process design**: How should founders structure decision processes to preserve flexibility while building credibility?

4. **Clock speed**: Does the optimal k* vary with industry clock speed?

### Suggested Reading Order

1. **This README** (5 min)
2. **methodology_verification_report.md** (15 min) - data & methods
3. **figures/three_hypotheses.png** - visual summary of Paper C
4. **papers/C/section2(c).md** - Golden Cage theory
