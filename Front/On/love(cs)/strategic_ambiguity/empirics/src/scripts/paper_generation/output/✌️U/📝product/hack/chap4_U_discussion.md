## 4.1 Summary of Findings

**Core Finding:** Vagueness-survival relationship is U-shaped, moderated by modularity

Our analysis of 51,840 venture-backed startups (2005-2023) reveals:
- H1: Vagueness reduces early-stage funding on average (adverse selection)
- H2: This penalty is conditional on modularity
  - Software (high modularity): vagueness preserves option value
  - Hardware (low modularity): vagueness signals unresolved risk

## 4.2 Theoretical Implications

### Productive vs. Destructive Ambiguity distinction

We distinguish:
- **Productive Ambiguity**: Vagueness that preserves strategic flexibility in modular environments
- **Destructive Ambiguity**: Vagueness that signals incompetence in non-modular environments

This resolves the paradox: Tesla's vagueness worked (software-like modularity in business model); Bosch's specificity worked (hardware constraints).

### Reconciling Information Economics and Real Options

| Context | Dominant Theory | Optimal Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Low Modularity | Information Economics | Specificity |
| High Modularity | Real Options | Vagueness |

## 4.3 Managerial Implications: The Tesla Rule

> **The Tesla Rule**: In software: stay vague on specifics, commit only to vision

**When Vagueness Works (Tesla Rule):**
- High modularity (software-intensive)
- High technical uncertainty
- Diverse customer segments

**When Specificity Works (Waymo Rule):**
- Low modularity (hardware-intensive)
- High capital requirements
- Homogeneous customer needs

### Decision Matrix

| **Modularity** | **High Uncertainty** | **Low Uncertainty** |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **High (Software)** | VAGUE (Tesla Rule) | SPECIFIC after validation |
| **Low (Hardware)** | SPECIFIC (signal depth) | SPECIFIC (reduce risk) |

## 4.4 Limitations

**Primary Limitation:** Correlational design; cannot claim causality

Additional limitations:
- Binary moderator (hardware vs software) oversimplifies
- Sample selection bias (VC-funded ventures only)
- Text-based vagueness measure captures positioning, not intent

## 4.5 Future Research

**Experimental manipulation of vagueness in pitch decks**

Additional directions:
- Dynamic vagueness trajectories (how do descriptions evolve?)
- Other moderators (customer heterogeneity, competitive intensity)
- Cross-country validation

## 4.6 Conclusion

Strategic vagueness is neither virtue nor vice, but a **tool whose value depends on context**. For entrepreneurs: know your technology's modularity before choosing communication strategy. For investors: differentiate productive from destructive ambiguity.

## Grand Synthesis: 기승전결 (起承轉結)

### The Complete Story

| Phase | Commander | Paper | Core Question | Answer |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 起 (Intro) | 정운 🐢 | P1 | When does vagueness pay? | When modularity enables cheap pivots |
| 承 (Theory) | 권준 🐅 | P2 | How does success kill options? | Through belief-reinforcing capital |
| 轉 (Empirics) | 김완 🐙 | P3 | How many options to hold? | V* = f(CR) |
| 結 (Discuss) | 어영담 👾 | All | What's the unified framework? | Options have architecture |

### The Unified Framework: Options Have Architecture

The value of strategic flexibility is not universal but depends on:

1. **Technology Architecture** (P1): Modularity determines pivot cost
2. **Capital Architecture** (P2): Board composition determines switching threshold
3. **Cost Architecture** (P3): CR ratio determines optimal portfolio size

### Actionable Rules Summary

| Rule | When to Apply | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Tesla Rule** | High modularity + high uncertainty | Stay vague, commit to vision only |
| **Waymo Rule** | Frontier tech + believer board risk | Keep doubters on board |
| **CR-V Rule** | Any strategic portfolio decision | Calibrate options to CR ratio |
| **Bosch Caveat** | Low modularity (hardware/biotech) | Specify early, signal depth |

### For Entrepreneurs

1. **Know your modularity** before choosing communication strategy
2. **Build opposition into governance** especially for frontier tech
3. **Estimate your CR** before deciding how many paths to pursue
4. **Recognize trap zones**: middle ground (P1), success (P2), wrong portfolio (P3)

### For Investors

1. **Differentiate productive from destructive ambiguity** based on modularity
2. **Assess cap table diversity** — all believers is a warning sign
3. **Evaluate portfolio strategy against industry CR** — FOMO may be rational
4. **Use decision matrices** not heuristics ("specificity = competence")

### The Final Wisdom

> **복잡한 것을 단순하게, 단순한 것을 아름답게, 아름다운 것을 기억에 남게.**
> "Make the complex simple, the simple beautiful, the beautiful memorable."

Strategic vagueness, properly understood, simplifies complexity by deferring premature commitment. But its beauty lies in knowing *when* to remain vague and *when* to specify — a contingency this research illuminates.
