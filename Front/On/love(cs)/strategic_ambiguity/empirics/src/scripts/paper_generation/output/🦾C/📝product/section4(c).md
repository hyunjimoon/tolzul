## 4.1 Summary of Findings

This paper asked when early-stage commitment becomes a constraint on growth. Using panel data on 123,906 technology ventures, we documented that capital creates commitment pressure that reduces strategic flexibility, and that flexibility strongly predicts growth.

Three findings emerge:

1. **Flexibility drives growth.** Ventures that demonstrated strategic flexibility achieved significantly higher growth (ρ = +0.159, p < 0.001). The most flexible quartile achieved 2.7× higher growth than the most rigid quartile.

2. **Capital reduces flexibility.** Controlling for initial positioning, early-stage capital is negatively associated with subsequent flexibility (ρ = -0.052, p < 0.001). This effect is consistent across all vagueness deciles.

3. **Capital's effect depends on positioning.** For ventures with precise positioning (Analyst channel), capital is negatively associated with growth (ρ = -0.05). For ventures with vague positioning (Believer channel), capital is positively associated with growth (ρ = +0.08).

## 4.2 Theoretical Contributions

**Boundary conditions for resource-based theory.** Our findings establish that the resource-advantage view holds when resources can be deployed flexibly. When resource acquisition creates binding commitments—as in venture funding—the relationship between resources and performance may be attenuated or reversed. This provides empirical content to theoretical discussions of when "more is less."

**Quantifying commitment cost.** We provide the first empirical quantification of commitment cost: the 2.7× flexibility gap. This gives content to abstract notions of "core rigidity" (Leonard-Barton 1992) and "success trap" (Levinthal and March 1993).

**The Golden Cage mechanism.** We identify a specific mechanism—belief variance collapse—that explains how resources transform from enablers to constraints. Capital attracts like-minded stakeholders, compresses belief heterogeneity, and raises the cost of strategic change. The trap is epistemic, not material.

## 4.3 Practical Implications

**For founders.** Recognize that funding success creates commitment pressure. The promises that secured capital attract stakeholders who believe in those promises. When circumstances suggest the need for change, homogeneous teams struggle to adapt. Deliberately preserve belief diversity: include skeptics among stakeholders, maintain board members who question the thesis, and resist the urge to fire doubters.

**For investors.** Belief homogeneity is a risk factor, not a sign of alignment. When everyone agrees, no one is positioned to champion alternatives when conditions change. Consider backing founders who maintain internal skeptics. Recognize that "strong thesis alignment" between founders and investors may create exactly the conditions for epistemic lock-in.

**For positioning strategy.** The interaction between capital and positioning (H3) has direct implications. Ventures pursuing the Analyst channel (precise positioning) should be cautious about large early rounds—capital amplifies rigidity. Ventures pursuing the Believer channel (vague positioning) can accept larger rounds—flexibility is preserved through positioning.

## 4.4 Limitations

**Correlational design.** We document associations, not causal effects. The mechanism chain E → |ΔV| → Y is supported by within-V identification and consistent patterns across deciles, but experimental validation would strengthen causal inference.

**Flexibility as outcome measure.** Our measure |ΔV| captures revealed flexibility—whether strategy changed—not latent capacity—whether it could have changed. A venture with low |ΔV| may have maintained the same strategy deliberately (no need to change) rather than being trapped. This attenuates our estimates.

**Indirect AOC measurement.** We infer Abandonment Option Cost from capital level rather than measuring it directly. Future work could measure abandonment costs through surveys, case studies, or analysis of failed pivot attempts.

**Sample selection.** Our panel conditions on ventures with longitudinal data. Ventures that failed quickly or succeeded spectacularly may not appear in our sample, potentially biasing estimates.

## 4.5 Future Directions

**Experimental validation.** Lab or field experiments that manipulate capital levels and measure flexibility could establish causality. Natural experiments—such as funding shocks or policy changes—could provide exogenous variation.

**Belief variance measurement.** Direct measurement of stakeholder belief heterogeneity would enable tests of the proposed mechanism. Surveys of founding teams, boards, or employee populations could assess whether capital indeed compresses belief variance.

**Pivot analysis.** Case studies of successful and failed pivots could illuminate the specific mechanisms by which commitment becomes constraint. What distinguishes ventures that escaped the trap from those that did not?

## 4.6 Conclusion

Resource-based theory assumes that resources can be deployed flexibly. Our findings suggest this assumption is violated in early-stage venture finance, where resource acquisition creates binding commitments that constrain subsequent adaptation.

The strategic implication is that capital has a dark side. The promises that secure funding attract like-minded stakeholders, compress belief heterogeneity, and raise the cost of strategic change. Well-funded ventures may find themselves in a "Golden Cage"—resourced but rigid, capable but constrained.

For founders and investors, the prescription is counterintuitive: maintain belief diversity. Include skeptics. Resist consensus. The trap is epistemic, and the escape is Bayesian hygiene—preserving the variance that enables learning.
