### Core Theoretical Foundation: Signaling × Real Options

---

## 2.1 Information Economics: Vagueness as Adverse Selection

The dominant view treats vagueness as a signal of low quality. **Akerlof's (1970)** "Market for Lemons" predicts that information asymmetry leads to adverse selection: high-quality ventures signal competence through specific, verifiable claims, while low-quality ventures hide behind vague language.

**Spence's (1973)** signaling theory formalizes this: costly signals separate high-types from low-types because vague claims are cheap talk. Empirical work confirms this negative view (Shane & Cable, 2002; Hsu, 2007; Zott & Huy, 2007).

**However**, this perspective overlooks **strategic flexibility**. In highly uncertain environments, early specificity may constitute premature commitment to untested assumptions.

## 2.2 Real Options: Vagueness as Strategic Flexibility

Real options theory offers a contrasting view: **vagueness preserves option value**. **McGrath (1997)** advocated for sequential commitments under uncertainty. By deferring specification, entrepreneurs retain the right to pivot.

**Kogut & Kulatilaka (2001)** and **Adner & Levinthal (2004)** support this in R&D contexts. However, real options theory implicitly assumes **costless switching** — valid for software but not for hardware.

## 2.3 Modularity Theory: When is Flexibility Valuable?

**Baldwin & Clark (2000)** define modularity as the degree to which components can be separated and recombined. **Ethiraj & Levinthal (2004)** show modularity's benefits depend on landscape ruggedness.

**Our contribution**: No prior work connects modularity to entrepreneurial communication strategy. We extend this logic to **positioning vagueness**.

## 2.4 Conceptual Framework: Four-Module Model (C-T-O-C)

| Module | Domain | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **C**ustomer | Value Creation | Heterogeneous segments → vague appeal |
| **T**echnology | Value Creation | Modularity → pivot cost |
| **O**rganization | Value Capture | Slack → exploration buffer |
| **C**ompetition | Value Capture | Crowding → differentiation value |

**This paper focuses on Module T (Technology Modularity).**

## 2.5 Hypothesis Development

**H1: Vagueness has U-shaped relationship with survival (V(1-V) coefficient > 0)**

Expected: Vagueness has non-linear effect. Moderate vagueness underperforms both extremes.

**H2: Modularity moderates: high modularity → vagueness positive**

Expected: β_interaction < 0 (hardware amplifies penalty)

**H2a: Software ventures (high modularity): vagueness → positive**
**H2b: Hardware ventures (low modularity): vagueness → negative**

---

**Key Variables:**
- Vagueness Score (V)
- Survival/Funding
- Modularity (Hardware/Software)

## Cross-Synthesis: Theoretical Integration

### How P1, P2, P3 Connect

```
P1 (U-Shape)                P3 (Newsvendor)               P2 (Competency Trap)
    ↓                            ↓                             ↓
Modularity determines    CR = C/(C+F) determines      Success raises switching
when vagueness pays      optimal option count         threshold
    ↓                            ↓                             ↓
    └──────────────── UNIFIED FRAMEWORK ───────────────────────┘
                              ↓
              Options have architecture.
              Value depends on cost structure.
```

### Shared Theoretical Foundation

All three papers share:
1. **Real Options Logic**: Strategic choices create/destroy option value
2. **Contingency View**: No universally optimal strategy
3. **Architecture Matters**: Technology/organization structure determines flexibility value

### Where They Diverge

| Dimension | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Focus | Communication | Learning | Portfolio |
| Key Moderator | Modularity | Cap Table | CR Ratio |
| Prescription | Go extreme | Keep doubters | Calibrate |
