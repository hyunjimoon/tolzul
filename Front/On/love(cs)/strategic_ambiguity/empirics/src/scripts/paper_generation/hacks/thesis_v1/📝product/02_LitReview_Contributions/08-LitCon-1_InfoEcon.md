This paper contributes to two primary streams of literature within operations management. The first stream concerns household food waste reduction. Prior research has identified two main pathways for reducing household food waste: altering food management behaviors at the household level, and implementing managerial changes at the retail level and food-service environments (see Akkas¸ and Gaur (2022) for a comprehensive review). Within households, food management practices related to meal planning, shopping frequency, and food storage were shown to play a crucial role in determining waste levels. Specific behaviors — including checking existing inventories before shopping, making grocery lists, freezing leftovers, and shopping more frequently — are associated with reduced waste. In contrast, buying in bulk and overpreparing food tend to increase waste (J¨orissen et al. 2015, Schanes et al. 2018, Ellison et al. 2022). At the retail level, consumer confusion over “best by,” “use by,” and “sell by” date labels, as well as large package sizes that are challenging for smaller households to finish before spoilage, have been identified as drivers of waste. As a result, efforts such as standardizing date labels and designing optimal package sizes have become focal points for waste reduction (Wilson et al. 2017, Toma et al. 2020). In food-service establishments, studies have shown that interventions such as smaller plate sizes or AI adoption can reduce waste (Reynolds et al. 2019, Nu et al. 2024). Our study contributes to this literature by examining the potential impact of online grocery shopping on household food waste.
