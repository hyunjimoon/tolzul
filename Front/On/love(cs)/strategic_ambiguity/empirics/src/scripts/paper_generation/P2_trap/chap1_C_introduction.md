# P2 🦾: Competency Trap: When Success Kills Options

## Chapter 1: Introduction (起)

> **Scott Trigger**: "Strong tech, stronger trap. 성공이 옵션을 죽인다."

> **Industry Context**: "Transportation industry is both capital intensive and fast clockspeed.
> The need for capital lures ventures into commitment trap, who are stuck then washed out

### The Success Paradox

In 2009, Waymo (then Google's self-driving car project) was the undisputed leader in autonomous vehicles. Their early commitment to LiDAR-based perception, HD mapping, and Level 4 autonomy attracted the best talent and billions in R&D investment. By 2015, they had the most miles driven, the best safety record, and the clearest technical roadmap.

By 2024, Waymo remains geofenced to select cities while Tesla — a company that committed to "pure vision" autonomy years later — deploys across North America. What went wrong?

### The Puzzle: 성공이 왜 발목을 잡는가?

Why do early technical advantages sometimes become liabilities? We propose that initial concrete commitment creates a **Competency Trap**: high commitment → like-minded investors/board → low posterior variance → unexercisable pivot options.

This is the **replacement effect** at the firm level. Early exploitation generates high μ, low σ priors, which reduce exploration incentives precisely when paradigm shifts demand flexibility.

### Theoretical Contributions

1. **Real Options × Core Rigidity**: We integrate Kogut & Kulatilaka's capabilities-as-options with Leonard-Barton's core rigidity framework.

2. **Bayesian Learning Model**: We show how "believer" capital structures raise the switching threshold, making pivot options theoretically valuable but practically unexercisable.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: Frontier tech × believer cap table → trap. We derive precise conditions for when commitment becomes fatal.

### Roadmap

- **Section 2** (권준 🐅): Theory — Real Options × Core Rigidity × Bayesian Learning
- **Section 3** (김완 🐙): Empirics — Tech paradigm shock analysis + case triangulation
- **Section 4** (어영담 👾): Implications — "앞선 기술일수록 다우터를 옆에 둬라"

## Cross-Synthesis: Three Papers, One Story

These three papers form a coherent whole:

1. **P1 (U-Shape)** asks: *When* does vagueness pay? Answer: When modularity enables cheap pivots.

2. **P2 (Competency Trap)** asks: *How* does early success kill options? Answer: Through belief-reinforcing capital structures.

3. **P3 (Optimal Options)** asks: *How many* options should you hold? Answer: It depends on CR = C/(C+F).

Together, they map the strategic landscape of entrepreneurial ambiguity:

| Paper | Core Trap | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| P1 ✌️ | Middle (neither vague nor concrete) | Go to extremes |
| P2 🦾 | Success (commitment lock-in) | Keep doubters on board |
| P3 🤹 | Wrong portfolio size | Calibrate to CR |

The common thread: **Options have architecture**. The value of flexibility depends on the cost structure of commitment vs. flexibility:

- **P1 ✌️** focuses on **Technology** architecture (modularity → pivot cost)
- **P2 🦾** focuses on **Organization** architecture (cap table → belief lock-in)
- **P3 🤹** focuses on **Competition** architecture (CR ratio → market timing)
