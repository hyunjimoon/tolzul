## Abstract

Signaling theory prescribes that entrepreneurs communicate with precision: specific technologies, measurable milestones, and verifiable claims reduce information asymmetry and attract investment. We test this prescription using data on 408,784 technology ventures across four industries. Contrary to the monotonic prediction, we document a robust U-shaped relationship between promise vagueness and long-term survival. Ventures with highly precise promises survive at 5.7%, those with highly vague promises survive at 8.6%, while intermediate positioning yields survival rates as low as 2.9%. We propose audience segmentation as the mechanism: precise promises attract "Analyst" investors who verify claims, while vague promises attract "Believer" investors who project their own vision. The middle ground activates neither evaluation mode. Our findings establish boundary conditions for signaling theory and suggest that strategic ambiguity, when deliberately chosen, can be a legitimate entrepreneurial strategy.

## 1.1 The Precision Prescription

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding entrepreneurial communication with resource providers (Spence 1973; Connelly et al. 2011). The core logic is straightforward: when quality is unobservable, high-quality actors can credibly distinguish themselves by sending signals that are costly to produce and correlated with underlying ability. Applied to entrepreneurship, this framework suggests that founders who articulate precise, verifiable promises—specific technologies, measurable milestones, concrete deliverables—enable investors to assess quality directly, separating capable founders from less capable imitators.

This precision prescription has become deeply embedded in entrepreneurial practice and pedagogy. The "scientific approach" to entrepreneurship (Camuffo et al. 2020) emphasizes formulating falsifiable hypotheses and gathering evidence systematically. Pitch deck guidelines advise founders to specify target markets, articulate clear value propositions, and define measurable success criteria. The underlying assumption is that clarity dominates ambiguity: more precise communication reduces uncertainty, facilitates evaluation, and improves funding outcomes.

We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis:

> **H₀:** Promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture growth.

## 1.2 An Empirical Puzzle

We test this hypothesis using a comprehensive dataset of 408,784 technology ventures that received early-stage funding between 2021 and 2025 across four industries: Software, Transportation, Hardware, and Pharmaceuticals. For each venture, we measure the vagueness of initial positioning using natural language processing applied to company descriptions at the time of first funding.

The data reveal a pattern that defies the monotonic prediction. When we divide ventures into quartiles by vagueness and compute survival rates to late-stage funding, we observe not a declining function but a U-shape:

| Quartile | Positioning | Survival Rate |
|:---------|:------------|:-------------:|
| Q1 | Precise | 5.7% |
| Q2 | Moderately precise | 2.9% |
| Q3 | Moderately vague | 4.0% |
| Q4 | Vague | 8.6% |

Both extremes outperform the middle. Ventures with the most precise positioning (Q1) survive at 5.7%, while those with the most vague positioning (Q4) survive at 8.6%. The worst outcomes occur in the intermediate range, with Q2 showing survival rates as low as 2.9%—approximately half the rate of either extreme.

This pattern holds across all four industries and is statistically robust (χ² > 300, p < 0.001 in each case). The anomaly demands explanation: if precision universally dominates, why do deliberately vague ventures thrive?

## 1.3 Research Question

We ask: **When is vagueness valuable despite signaling theory's precision prescription?**

This question addresses a fundamental tension in entrepreneurial communication. On one hand, precision enables verification and reduces information asymmetry. On the other hand, precision constrains future action and may prematurely narrow the scope of opportunities. Existing theory provides little guidance on when one consideration dominates the other.

## 1.4 Theoretical Framework: Audience Segmentation

We propose that promise precision functions not as a universal quality signal but as a sorting mechanism that attracts distinct investor types. Drawing on research in strategic ambiguity (Eisenberg 1984), we suggest that investor audiences differ systematically in their evaluation modes and corresponding preferences for precision.

**The Analyst Channel.** Some investors prioritize due diligence and systematic evaluation. They seek verifiable claims, measurable milestones, and direct assessment of founder competence. For these investors, precision reduces uncertainty and enables benchmarking against comparable opportunities. We label this the "Analyst" channel.

**The Believer Channel.** Other investors prioritize transformative potential and founder vision. They seek ambitious scope, mission alignment, and openness to adjacent opportunities. For these investors, vagueness is not noise but signal: it indicates room for growth and visionary thinking. Eisenberg (1984, p. 239) observes that "the more ambiguous the message, the greater the room for projection," where projection allows receivers to "fill in the meaning... in a way which is consistent with their own beliefs." We label this the "Believer" channel.

**The Murky Middle.** Intermediate vagueness activates neither channel effectively. Positioning that is too vague for Analysts to verify yet too specific for Believers to project fails to attract committed support from either audience. This explains the U-shape: both extremes succeed because they clearly signal which evaluation mode to apply, while the middle fails because it provides insufficient clarity for either.

## 1.5 Main Findings

Our empirical analysis yields three findings:

**First, we reject the monotonic null.** The relationship between vagueness and survival is not monotonically negative. Both low-vagueness and high-vagueness ventures outperform intermediate positioning.

**Second, we confirm the U-shape.** Using non-parametric quartile analysis, we find robust U-shaped patterns across all four industries (χ² p < 0.001 in each case). The "Murky Middle Penalty"—defined as the survival advantage of extremes over middle quartiles—ranges from 2.1 to 3.7 percentage points depending on industry.

**Third, we document asymmetry favoring vagueness.** In all four industries, Q4 (high vagueness) outperforms Q1 (low vagueness), suggesting that the Believer channel may be somewhat more prevalent or more valuable than the Analyst channel in contemporary venture finance.

## 1.6 Contributions

This paper makes three contributions.

First, we establish empirical boundary conditions for signaling theory in entrepreneurship. The precision prescription holds for verification-oriented audiences but fails for projection-oriented audiences. This implies that signaling theory's domain is narrower than commonly assumed.

Second, we document a robust stylized fact—the U-shaped relationship between promise vagueness and venture survival—across multiple industries with substantial sample sizes. This pattern appears to be a structural feature of entrepreneurial finance rather than an artifact of specific contexts.

Third, we provide actionable guidance for founders. The strategic implication is that vagueness is not a dial to tune but a playbook to choose: founders should commit fully to either the Analyst channel (precise, verifiable) or the Believer channel (visionary, abstract), avoiding the middle ground that satisfies neither audience.

## 1.7 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops our theoretical framework, deriving testable hypotheses from the audience segmentation mechanism. Section 3 describes our data, measurement approach, and empirical methodology. Section 4 presents results. Section 5 discusses implications, limitations, and directions for future research.
