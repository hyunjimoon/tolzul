## 4.1 Summary of Findings

**Core Finding:** Optimal option count k* depends on CR = C/(C+F)

The Commitment Ratio CR = C/(C+F) determines whether FOMO is rational or destructive.

**The Unified Formula:**
```
k* = F_D⁻¹(C/(C+F))
```

Where D from P1 (modularity), C/F from P2 (belief structure).

## 4.2 Theoretical Implications

### Newsvendor Framework for Strategic Options

We reframe entrepreneurial portfolio strategy as a newsvendor problem:
- **C (Commitment Cost)**: Lock-in, imitation risk, sunk CAPEX
- **F (Flexibility Cost)**: Late entry penalty, option maintenance, coordination

This unifies P1 and P2:
- **P1's trap (middle ground)**: CR ≈ 0.5, neither extreme works
- **P2's trap (success lock-in)**: CR → 1, should have kept more options

### Anxiety as Survival Skill

The behavioral edge:
- **Overconfident founders** set C = 0 mentally and die
- **Anxious founders** (high FOMO) invest in flexibility and survive

**Counterintuitively, anxiety is a survival skill when C >> F.**

## 4.3 Managerial Implications: The CR–V Rule (Rational FOMO)

> **The CR–V Rule**: CR > 0.7 → multiple paths rational; CR < 0.3 → commit early

### CR–V Plane Decision Rules

| CR Range | Interpretation | Strategy |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| CR < 0.3 | Flexibility expensive, commitment cheap | Commit early (1 path) |
| 0.3 < CR < 0.7 | Balanced costs | Moderate portfolio (2 paths) |
| CR > 0.7 | Commitment expensive, flexibility cheap | Many options (3+ paths) |

### Industry Examples

| Industry | Estimated CR | Optimal k* |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Mature Manufacturing | 0.2 | 1 path |
| Enterprise SaaS | 0.4 | 1-2 paths |
| Autonomous Vehicles | 0.65 | 2-3 paths |
| Quantum Computing | 0.85 | 3+ paths |

### When FOMO is Rational

FOMO is rational when:
1. Paradigm shifts are likely (high C)
2. Late entry is viable (low F)
3. Option maintenance is cheap (low F)

FOMO is destructive when:
1. Market rewards early movers (high F)
2. Options have significant coordination overhead (high F)

---

## 4.4 Limitations

**Primary Limitation:** CR estimation requires industry-specific calibration

CR estimation requires:
- Industry-specific cost structures
- Market uncertainty estimates
- Option maintenance cost data

These are often unobservable or require significant research effort.

---

## 4.5 Future Research

**Dynamic CR tracking as markets evolve**

Also:
- Real-time CR dashboards for investors
- CR as a function of firm lifecycle stage
- Network effects on F (platform lock-in)

---

## 4.6 Conclusion

The question is not "should I commit?" but "what is my CR?" Armed with this framework, entrepreneurs can calibrate their option portfolios rationally, and investors can evaluate portfolio strategy against industry-specific cost structures.

**The Designer engineers uncertainty. Anxiety is a survival skill.**

## Connection to the Trilogy: Grand Synthesis

P3 synthesizes the trilogy into a single optimization:
- **D** from P1: Modularity determines outcome distribution
- **C/F** from P2: Belief structure determines cost ratio
- **k*** from P3: Optimal option portfolio size

### The Founder's Complete Journey

| Act | State | Lesson | Formula Component |
|-----|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Dreamer | "Vagueness is an Option" | D (distribution) |
| 2 | Believer | "Success kills options" | C/F (cost ratio) |
| 3 | Designer | "FOMO is Optimal" | k* (optimal count) |

### Actionable Rules Summary

| Rule | When to Apply | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Tesla Rule** | High modularity + high uncertainty | Stay vague, commit to vision only |
| **Waymo Rule** | Frontier tech + believer board risk | Keep doubters on board |
| **CR-V Rule** | Any strategic portfolio decision | Calibrate options to CR ratio |
| **Bosch Caveat** | Low modularity (hardware/biotech) | Specify early, signal depth |

## The Final Wisdom

> **복잡한 것을 단순하게, 단순한 것을 아름답게, 아름다운 것을 기억에 남게.**
> "Make the complex simple, the simple beautiful, the beautiful memorable."

Strategic vagueness, properly understood, simplifies complexity by deferring premature commitment. But its beauty lies in knowing *when* to remain vague and *when* to specify — a contingency this research illuminates.

**필사즉생 (必死卽生)**: The founders who survive embrace the uncomfortable truth — clarity is overrated, success is dangerous, and fear is rational.
