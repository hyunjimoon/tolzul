Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal level of promise variance is governed by the ratio of the venture's potential value to these endogenous rigidity costs. 
- We derive a clear threshold rule: when the costs of being wrong are high relative to the value of securing initial support, an entrepreneur should remain deliberately ambiguous (maintain high variance). Precision must be "earned" as the venture de-risks and the value of commitment begins to outweigh the value of flexibility. 
- This formalizes the intuition that ventures should transition from an exploratory, high-variance stance to a more defined, low-variance one as they mature.

We present compelling evidence that increasing the frequency of online grocery shopping can significantly reduce household food waste for perishable categories such as bread and cheese. Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of grocery trips conducted online is estimated to reduce our food waste proxy by approximately 8.0% for bread and 7.4% for cheese. In contrast, we find smaller or no significant effect of online shopping frequency on less perishable categories such as cereal, cookies, and soup. These findings align with our theoretical prediction that the waste-reducing benefits of online grocery adoption are most pronounced for highly perishable goods, whose spoilage risk is more sensitive to shopping frequency and timing. These findings shed light on the possibility that a shift toward digital grocery channels can contribute to household waste reduction efforts, particularly for highly perishable goods.
