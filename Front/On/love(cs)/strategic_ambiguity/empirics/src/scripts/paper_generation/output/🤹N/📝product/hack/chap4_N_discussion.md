## 4.1 Summary of Findings

**Core Finding:** Optimal option count V* depends on CR = C/(C+F)

The Commitment Ratio CR = C/(C+F) determines whether FOMO is rational or destructive.

## 4.2 Theoretical Implications

### Newsvendor framework for strategic options

We reframe entrepreneurial portfolio strategy as a newsvendor problem:
- **C (Commitment Cost)**: Lock-in, imitation risk, sunk CAPEX
- **F (Flexibility Cost)**: Late entry penalty, option maintenance, coordination

This unifies P1 and P2:
- **P1's trap (middle ground)**: CR ≈ 0.5, neither extreme works
- **P2's trap (success lock-in)**: CR → 1, should have kept more options

## 4.3 Managerial Implications: The CR–V Rule (Rational FOMO)

> **The CR–V Rule (Rational FOMO)**: CR > 0.7 → multiple paths rational; CR < 0.3 → commit early

### CR–V Plane Decision Rules

| CR Range | Interpretation | Strategy |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| CR < 0.3 | Flexibility expensive, commitment cheap | Commit early (1 path) |
| 0.3 < CR < 0.7 | Balanced costs | Moderate portfolio (2 paths) |
| CR > 0.7 | Commitment expensive, flexibility cheap | Many options (3+ paths) |

### Industry Examples

| Industry | Estimated CR | Optimal V* |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Mature Manufacturing | 0.2 | 1 path |
| Enterprise SaaS | 0.4 | 1-2 paths |
| Autonomous Vehicles | 0.65 | 2-3 paths |
| Quantum Computing | 0.85 | 3+ paths |

### When FOMO is Rational

FOMO is rational when:
1. Paradigm shifts are likely (high C)
2. Late entry is viable (low F)
3. Option maintenance is cheap (low F)

FOMO is destructive when:
1. Market rewards early movers (high F)
2. Options have significant coordination overhead (high F)

## 4.4 Limitations

**Primary Limitation:** CR estimation requires industry-specific calibration

CR estimation requires:
- Industry-specific cost structures
- Market uncertainty estimates
- Option maintenance cost data

These are often unobservable or require significant research effort.

## 4.5 Future Research

**Dynamic CR tracking as markets evolve**

Also:
- Real-time CR dashboards for investors
- CR as a function of firm lifecycle stage
- Network effects on F (platform lock-in)

## 4.6 Conclusion

The question is not "should I commit?" but "what is my CR?" Armed with this framework, entrepreneurs can calibrate their option portfolios rationally, and investors can evaluate portfolio strategy against industry-specific cost structures.

## Grand Synthesis: 기승전결 (起承轉結)

### The Complete Story

| Phase | Commander | Paper | Core Question | Answer |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 起 (Intro) | 정운 🐢 | P1 | When does vagueness pay? | When modularity enables cheap pivots |
| 承 (Theory) | 권준 🐅 | P2 | How does success kill options? | Through belief-reinforcing capital |
| 轉 (Empirics) | 김완 🐙 | P3 | How many options to hold? | V* = f(CR) |
| 結 (Discuss) | 어영담 👾 | All | What's the unified framework? | Options have architecture |

### The Unified Framework: Options Have Architecture

The value of strategic flexibility is not universal but depends on:

1. **Technology Architecture** (P1): Modularity determines pivot cost
2. **Capital Architecture** (P2): Board composition determines switching threshold
3. **Cost Architecture** (P3): CR ratio determines optimal portfolio size

### Actionable Rules Summary

| Rule | When to Apply | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Tesla Rule** | High modularity + high uncertainty | Stay vague, commit to vision only |
| **Waymo Rule** | Frontier tech + believer board risk | Keep doubters on board |
| **CR-V Rule** | Any strategic portfolio decision | Calibrate options to CR ratio |
| **Bosch Caveat** | Low modularity (hardware/biotech) | Specify early, signal depth |

### For Entrepreneurs

1. **Know your modularity** before choosing communication strategy
2. **Build opposition into governance** especially for frontier tech
3. **Estimate your CR** before deciding how many paths to pursue
4. **Recognize trap zones**: middle ground (P1), success (P2), wrong portfolio (P3)

### For Investors

1. **Differentiate productive from destructive ambiguity** based on modularity
2. **Assess cap table diversity** — all believers is a warning sign
3. **Evaluate portfolio strategy against industry CR** — FOMO may be rational
4. **Use decision matrices** not heuristics ("specificity = competence")

### The Final Wisdom

> **복잡한 것을 단순하게, 단순한 것을 아름답게, 아름다운 것을 기억에 남게.**
> "Make the complex simple, the simple beautiful, the beautiful memorable."

Strategic vagueness, properly understood, simplifies complexity by deferring premature commitment. But its beauty lies in knowing *when* to remain vague and *when* to specify — a contingency this research illuminates.
