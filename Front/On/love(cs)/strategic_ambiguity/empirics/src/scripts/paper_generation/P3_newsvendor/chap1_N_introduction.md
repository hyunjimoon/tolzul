# P3 🤹: Execution Gap: Optimal Number of Options

## Chapter 1: Introduction (起)

> **Scott Trigger**: "Newsvendor of options. FOMO도 조건부로 합리적이다."

### The FOMO Dilemma

In the autonomous vehicle industry, three distinct technical approaches coexist: LiDAR-first (Waymo), vision-first (Tesla), and deliberately ambiguous (Comma.ai). Traditional strategy advice would demand early commitment. Yet some of the most successful AV startups maintain strategic ambiguity about their technical stack well into Series C.

Is this FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) on alternative paths? Or is it rational portfolio management?

### The Puzzle: 옵션은 몇 개나 들고 가야 하는가?

We reframe this as a **Newsvendor problem for options**. Just as a newsvendor optimizes inventory given demand uncertainty and holding/stockout costs, entrepreneurs optimize their portfolio of strategic options given:

- **Commitment Cost (C)**: Lock-in, imitation risk, sunk CAPEX
- **Flexibility Cost (F)**: Late entry penalty, option maintenance, coordination overhead

The optimal number of options V* = f(C, F, market uncertainty). When C >> F, many options are rational. When F >> C, early commitment dominates.

### Theoretical Contributions

1. **Newsvendor of Options**: We provide a formal model linking commitment/flexibility costs to optimal option portfolio size.

2. **Unifying P1 and P2**: The Commitment Ratio CR = C/(C+F) places P1's flexibility trap and P2's commitment trap on a single continuum.

3. **Rational FOMO**: We show when maintaining multiple technical paths is not indecision but optimization.

### Roadmap

- **Section 2** (권준 🐅): Theory — Newsvendor × Coordination/OM Framework
- **Section 3** (김완 🐙): Empirics — CR calibration across industries
- **Section 4** (어영담 👾): Implications — CR–V plane design rules

## Cross-Synthesis: Three Papers, One Story

These three papers form a coherent whole:

1. **P1 (U-Shape)** asks: *When* does vagueness pay? Answer: When modularity enables cheap pivots.

2. **P2 (Competency Trap)** asks: *How* does early success kill options? Answer: Through belief-reinforcing capital structures.

3. **P3 (Optimal Options)** asks: *How many* options should you hold? Answer: It depends on CR = C/(C+F).

Together, they map the strategic landscape of entrepreneurial ambiguity:

| Paper | Core Trap | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| P1 ✌️ | Middle (neither vague nor concrete) | Go to extremes |
| P2 🦾 | Success (commitment lock-in) | Keep doubters on board |
| P3 🤹 | Wrong portfolio size | Calibrate to CR |

The common thread: **Options have architecture**. The value of flexibility depends on the cost structure of commitment vs. flexibility:

- **P1 ✌️** focuses on **Technology** architecture (modularity → pivot cost)
- **P2 🦾** focuses on **Organization** architecture (cap table → belief lock-in)
- **P3 🤹** focuses on **Competition** architecture (CR ratio → market timing)
