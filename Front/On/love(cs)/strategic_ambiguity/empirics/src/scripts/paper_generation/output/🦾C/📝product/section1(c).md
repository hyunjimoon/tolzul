## Abstract

Entrepreneurship research and practice share a common assumption: more capital is better. Resources enable experimentation, attract talent, and provide runway for iteration. We test this assumption using panel data on 123,906 technology ventures. Contrary to expectations, we find that early-stage capital is associated with reduced strategic flexibility (ρ = -0.052, p < 0.001), and that flexibility strongly predicts growth (ρ = +0.159, p < 0.001). Ventures that maintained strategic flexibility achieved 2.7× higher growth than those that remained rigid. We propose that capital creates commitment pressure: the promises made to secure funding attract like-minded stakeholders, compress belief variance, and raise the cost of strategic change. This "Golden Cage" mechanism explains why well-resourced ventures sometimes underperform scrappier competitors. The findings establish boundary conditions for resource-based theory and suggest that in high-uncertainty environments, deprivation may paradoxically enable success.

## 1.1 The Resource Advantage Prescription

Resource-based theory holds that superior resources generate superior performance (Barney 1991). Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that early-stage capital provides multiple advantages: runway to iterate, signals of quality to attract talent, and competitive firepower for market entry. The practical advice follows directly—raise more, earlier.

This prescription has become deeply embedded in entrepreneurial practice. Founders celebrate large funding rounds; venture capitalists compete for deals; success stories are narrated through the lens of capital accumulation. The underlying assumption is that resources enable experimentation and learning, and that more experimentation leads to better outcomes.

We formalize this conventional wisdom:

> **H₀:** More early-stage capital enables greater experimentation and improves growth outcomes.

## 1.2 An Empirical Puzzle

We test this hypothesis using panel data on 123,906 technology ventures tracked from early-stage funding through subsequent outcomes. For each venture, we measure strategic flexibility as the absolute change in positioning between early and later stages (|ΔV|), and we measure growth as the ratio of later-stage to early-stage funding (Y = L/E).

The data reveal a counterintuitive pattern. When we examine ventures that secured substantial early-stage capital, we find:

1. **Capital reduces flexibility.** Controlling for initial positioning, early-stage capital is negatively associated with subsequent strategic change (ρ = -0.052, p < 0.001). Well-funded ventures are less likely to adjust their strategies.

2. **Flexibility predicts growth.** Strategic flexibility is positively associated with funding growth (ρ = +0.159, p < 0.001). Ventures that adapted their positioning outperformed those that did not.

3. **The combined effect.** Flexible ventures achieved 2.7× higher growth than rigid ventures. Yet well-funded ventures were more likely to be rigid.

This pattern contradicts the resource-advantage view. If capital enables experimentation, well-funded ventures should show *more* flexibility, not less. The anomaly demands explanation.

## 1.3 Research Question

We ask: **When does early-stage commitment become a constraint on growth?**

This question addresses a tension in entrepreneurial strategy. Capital provides resources for adaptation, but it also creates expectations for execution. The promises made to secure funding may limit the scope for subsequent change. Understanding when and why this constraint binds is critical for both founders and investors.

## 1.4 Theoretical Framework: The Golden Cage

We propose that capital creates commitment pressure through what we term the "Golden Cage" mechanism. The core logic proceeds in three steps:

**Step 1: Capital requires commitment.** To secure funding, founders make specific promises—about technology, markets, milestones. These promises are the basis on which investors evaluate the opportunity.

**Step 2: Commitment attracts like-minded stakeholders.** Specific promises attract investors, employees, and partners who share the articulated vision. This creates stakeholder homogeneity: everyone agrees on the direction.

**Step 3: Homogeneity blocks adaptation.** When new information suggests the need for strategic change, homogeneous teams struggle to update. The shared commitment that facilitated coordination now prevents learning. The venture is trapped in a "Golden Cage"—well-resourced but unable to adapt.

The mechanism can be understood through a Bayesian lens. Let σ² represent belief variance among stakeholders. High commitment compresses σ²: everyone converges on the same view. But learning requires belief diversity. When σ² → 0, even strong signals of needed change fail to move the posterior. The venture becomes epistemically trapped.

## 1.5 Main Findings

We verify three hypotheses that operationalize the Golden Cage mechanism:

**H1: Flexibility → Growth.** Among ventures with similar early-stage funding, those that demonstrated greater strategic flexibility achieved higher growth. This confirms that adaptation is valuable. (ρ = +0.158, p < 0.001)

**H2: Capital → Rigidity.** Controlling for initial positioning, ventures with more early-stage capital showed less subsequent flexibility. Capital reduces—not enables—adaptation. (ρ = -0.052, p < 0.001)

**H3: Heterogeneous effects by positioning.** The capital-growth relationship depends on initial positioning. For ventures in the "Analyst" channel (low vagueness), capital is negatively associated with growth (ρ = -0.05). For ventures in the "Believer" channel (high vagueness), capital is positively associated with growth (ρ = +0.08).

The H3 finding connects to our companion paper on vagueness. Precise positioning creates more commitment pressure; vague positioning preserves option value. Capital amplifies whichever dynamic is present.

## 1.6 Contributions

This paper makes three contributions.

First, we identify boundary conditions for resource-based theory in entrepreneurship. The resource-advantage view holds when resources can be deployed flexibly. When resource acquisition creates binding commitments—as in early-stage venture funding—the relationship between resources and performance may be attenuated or reversed.

Second, we provide the first empirical quantification of commitment cost. The 2.7× flexibility gap represents the performance difference between ventures that adapted and those that did not. This gives content to abstract notions of "core rigidity" (Leonard-Barton 1992) and "success trap" (Levinthal and March 1993).

Third, we offer actionable guidance for practitioners. For founders: recognize that funding success creates commitment pressure; deliberately preserve belief diversity. For investors: understand that belief homogeneity is a risk factor; consider backing founders who maintain skeptics among their stakeholders.

## 1.7 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops our theoretical framework, deriving testable hypotheses from the Golden Cage mechanism. Section 3 describes our data, measures, and empirical approach. Section 4 presents results. Section 5 discusses implications, limitations, and directions for future research.
