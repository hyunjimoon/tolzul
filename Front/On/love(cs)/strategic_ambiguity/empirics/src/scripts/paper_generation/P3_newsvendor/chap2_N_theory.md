### Core Theoretical Foundation: Newsvendor of Options × Coordination

---

## 2.1 The Newsvendor Problem as Strategic Metaphor

The classic newsvendor problem optimizes order quantity under demand uncertainty. We reinterpret this for **strategic options**:

- **Order quantity** → Number of options (V)
- **Holding cost** → Flexibility cost (F) — maintaining uncommitted resources
- **Stockout cost** → Commitment cost (C) — missing winning path

## 2.2 Commitment Cost (C) vs. Flexibility Cost (F)

**Commitment Cost (C)** includes:
- Lock-in to inferior technology
- Imitation risk from revealed strategy
- Sunk CAPEX in specific capabilities

**Flexibility Cost (F)** includes:
- Late entry penalty
- Option maintenance overhead
- Coordination costs across paths

## 2.3 The Commitment Ratio: Unifying P1 and P2

Define **CR = C / (C + F)**

- **CR → 1**: Commitment is costly, flexibility is cheap → More options optimal (P2's trap zone)
- **CR → 0**: Flexibility is costly, commitment is cheap → Few options optimal (P1's trap zone)

This ratio places P1's flexibility trap and P2's commitment trap on a **single continuum**.

## 2.4 Conceptual Framework: CR–V Plane

| CR Range | Optimal Strategy | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| CR < 0.3 | Commit early | Mature manufacturing |
| 0.3 < CR < 0.7 | Balanced portfolio | Most tech startups |
| CR > 0.7 | Many options | Paradigm-shifting tech |

---

## 2.5 Hypothesis Development

**H1: Optimal option number V* = f(C, F, σ_market)**

Formal: V* = argmax E[payoff] subject to resource constraints

**H2: CR = C/(C+F) predicts option portfolio strategy**

CR predicts optimal portfolio, not just optimal individual bets

**H3: High CR industries → more options rational**

Where imitation risk high and late entry less penalized, FOMO is rational

**Key Variables:**
- Commitment Cost (C)
- Flexibility Cost (F)
- Option Count (V)
- CR Ratio

## Cross-Synthesis: Theoretical Integration

### How P1, P2, P3 Connect

```
P1 (U-Shape)                P3 (Newsvendor)               P2 (Competency Trap)
    ↓                            ↓                             ↓
Modularity determines    CR = C/(C+F) determines      Success raises switching

              Options have architecture.
              Value depends on cost structure.
```

### Shared Theoretical Foundation

All three papers share:
1. **Real Options Logic**: Strategic choices create/destroy option value
2. **Contingency View**: No universally optimal strategy
3. **Architecture Matters**: Technology/organization structure determines flexibility value

### Where They Diverge

| Dimension | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Focus | Communication | Learning | Portfolio |
| Key Moderator | Modularity | Cap Table | CR Ratio |
| Prescription | Go extreme | Keep doubters | Calibrate |
