## 4.1 Summary of Findings

**Core Finding:** Early success creates belief lock-in that kills pivot options

The mechanism:
```
Early Success → Believer Investors → Reinforced Priors → High Switch Threshold → Trap
```

## 4.2 Theoretical Implications

### Bayesian Learning × Core Rigidity integration

We integrate:
- **Kogut & Kulatilaka**: Capabilities as options
- **Leonard-Barton**: Core rigidity
- **Bayesian Learning**: Belief updating with social reinforcement

Key insight: The trap is **epistemic**, not just technical. Founders and boards converge on shared beliefs that make alternative evidence dismissible.

## 4.3 Managerial Implications: The Waymo Rule (Keep Doubters)

> **The Waymo Rule (Keep Doubters)**: Frontier tech needs contrarian/skeptic board presence

**앞선 기술일수록 다우터를 옆에 둬라 (The more frontier the tech, the more doubters you need)**

### Board Composition Guidance

| Technology Type | Recommended Board Mix |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Incremental | 80% believers, 20% skeptics |
| Adjacent | 60% believers, 40% skeptics |
| Frontier | 40% believers, 60% skeptics |

### Warning Signs of Trap Formation

1. Board unanimity on technical roadmap
2. Declining exploration budget despite market signals
3. "Our early success proves we're right" reasoning
4. Dismissing competitors as "not understanding the problem"

## 4.4 Limitations

**Primary Limitation:** Case-dependent evidence; Bayesian model stylized

The Bayesian model is illustrative, not tested structurally. Case evidence supports the mechanism but cannot rule out alternative explanations.

## 4.5 Future Research

**Longitudinal cap table × pivot analysis**

Also needed:
- Structural estimation of switching thresholds
- Natural experiments (board member exits)
- Extension to non-tech industries

## 4.6 Conclusion

Success is dangerous precisely because it feels validating. The same early wins that attract resources and talent also create belief structures that resist pivoting. Smart founders build opposition into their governance from day one.

## Grand Synthesis: 기승전결 (起承轉結)

### The Complete Story

| Phase | Commander | Paper | Core Question | Answer |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 起 (Intro) | 정운 🐢 | P1 | When does vagueness pay? | When modularity enables cheap pivots |
| 承 (Theory) | 권준 🐅 | P2 | How does success kill options? | Through belief-reinforcing capital |
| 轉 (Empirics) | 김완 🐙 | P3 | How many options to hold? | V* = f(CR) |
| 結 (Discuss) | 어영담 👾 | All | What's the unified framework? | Options have architecture |

### The Unified Framework: Options Have Architecture

The value of strategic flexibility is not universal but depends on:

1. **Technology Architecture** (P1): Modularity determines pivot cost
2. **Capital Architecture** (P2): Board composition determines switching threshold
3. **Cost Architecture** (P3): CR ratio determines optimal portfolio size

### Actionable Rules Summary

| Rule | When to Apply | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Tesla Rule** | High modularity + high uncertainty | Stay vague, commit to vision only |
| **Waymo Rule** | Frontier tech + believer board risk | Keep doubters on board |
| **CR-V Rule** | Any strategic portfolio decision | Calibrate options to CR ratio |
| **Bosch Caveat** | Low modularity (hardware/biotech) | Specify early, signal depth |

### For Entrepreneurs

1. **Know your modularity** before choosing communication strategy
2. **Build opposition into governance** especially for frontier tech
3. **Estimate your CR** before deciding how many paths to pursue
4. **Recognize trap zones**: middle ground (P1), success (P2), wrong portfolio (P3)

### For Investors

1. **Differentiate productive from destructive ambiguity** based on modularity
2. **Assess cap table diversity** — all believers is a warning sign
3. **Evaluate portfolio strategy against industry CR** — FOMO may be rational
4. **Use decision matrices** not heuristics ("specificity = competence")

### The Final Wisdom

> **복잡한 것을 단순하게, 단순한 것을 아름답게, 아름다운 것을 기억에 남게.**
> "Make the complex simple, the simple beautiful, the beautiful memorable."

Strategic vagueness, properly understood, simplifies complexity by deferring premature commitment. But its beauty lies in knowing *when* to remain vague and *when* to specify — a contingency this research illuminates.
