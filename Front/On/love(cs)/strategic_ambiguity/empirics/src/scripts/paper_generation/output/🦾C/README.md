# 🦾C: The Commitment Trap — When Belief Lock-in Kills Options

> **Core IP**: θ* = μ + kσ (Pivot threshold rises as variance collapses)
> **Target**: Strategic Management Journal
> **Domain**: Entrepreneurial Strategy & Bayesian Learning

---

## 🔑 Key Finding (v2.0 Verified)

Among **488,381 technology ventures**, commitment level shows a **U-shaped** relationship with venture growth:

| Industry | Q1 (High θ) | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 (Low θ) | Murky Middle Δ |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Transportation | 8.6% | 4.0% | 2.9% | 5.7% | **+3.7pp** |
| Software | 8.0% | 6.8% | 4.8% | 7.8% | **+2.1pp** |
| Hardware | 8.7% | 3.9% | 3.7% | 6.0% | **+3.6pp** |
| Pharma | 10.6% | 6.2% | 5.7% | 8.8% | **+3.7pp** |

**H₀ Rejected**: Higher commitment ≠ better outcomes
**H₁ Confirmed**: Extremes outperform the middle (χ² p < 0.001)

## 📐 Theoretical Framework: Bayesian Belief Lock-in

### Core Mechanism

```
High Commitment (θ)
    → Attracts Like-minded Believers
    → τ ↑ (Precision increases)
    → σ² ↓ (Variance decreases)
    → Pivot threshold θ* = μ + kσ rises
    → Options become unexercisable
    → Trap Complete
```

### The Key Formula

**Pivot Threshold:**
$$\theta^* = \mu + k\sigma$$

When σ → 0 (no belief variance), θ* → μ (any deviation dismissed as noise).

**The trap is epistemic, not technical.**

## 🔗 ✌️U Integration

🦾C shares data and measurement with ✌️U:

| Concept | ✌️U | 🦾C | Relationship |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Variable** | V (Vagueness) | θ (Commitment) | **θ = 100 - V** |
| **Framing** | Communication | Resource allocation | Same phenomenon |
| **Pattern** | U-shape in V | U-shape in θ | Mirror image |
| **Prescription** | "Playbook to choose" | "Trap to avoid" | Same advice |

## 🎯 Hypotheses

### H₀ (Commitment Null) — REJECTED
> Higher commitment levels monotonically increase venture growth.

### H₁ (Commitment Trap) — CONFIRMED
> The relationship is U-shaped: both high and low commitment outperform the middle.

## 🏢 Case Studies

### Trapped Ventures
| Company | θ Level | Outcome |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Waymo | High | Geofenced, limited scale |
| Cruise | High | 50% layoffs, operations paused |
| Argo AI | High | Complete shutdown |

### Escaped Ventures
| Company | θ Level | Outcome |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Comma.ai | Low | Wide deployment |
| Tesla | Low | $800B+ valuation |

## 📊 Three-Paper Integration

```
✌️U → D (Distribution of V)
       ↓
🦾C → C, F (Commitment/Flexibility costs)
       ↓
🤹N → k* = F_D⁻¹(C/(C+F))
```

## 💡 Punchline

> **"The trap is epistemic, not technical. Keep doubters on board — σ maintenance is Bayesian hygiene."**
