# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Abstract

The prevailing wisdom—"more funding is better"—underlies nearly all entrepreneurial advice. Yet among **180,860 technology ventures** tracked from 2021-2025, we find a striking anomaly: companies with less early funding that stayed strategically flexible achieved **8.8× better funding growth** than well-funded companies that stayed the course.

We explain this through a mechanism chain:
$$\frac{dY}{dE} = \underbrace{\frac{dY}{d|\Delta V|}}_{(+)} \times \underbrace{\frac{d|\Delta V|}{dE}}_{(-)} < 0$$

Capital demands commitment. Commitment homogenizes teams. Homogeneity blocks learning. Using a counterfactual framework conditioning on early funding level, we estimate the **Cost of Commitment** at -2.5× forgone funding growth per decile. The strategic implication: **deprivation breeds flexibility, and flexibility breeds success**.

## Core Narrative (Gospel → Puzzle → Answer)

| | Gospel → Puzzle → Answer |
|:---|:---|
| **Gospel** | More 💰capital = more 🧪experiment = better 🧠learning |
| **Puzzle** | Startups with higher E changed strategy less (|ΔV|↓) and grew less (Y↓) |
| **Answer** | Capital requests commitment → commitment homogenizes team → homogeneity blocks learning |

## ¶1 The Resource Advantage Prescription

> **H₀ (Null):** More early funding → Better outcomes

The Resource-Based View (Barney 1991) and entrepreneurial finance literature prescribe a clear path: secure resources early. Early funding provides runway, signals quality, attracts talent, and enables competitive moves. Founders celebrate mega-rounds; VCs compete for deals; success stories are told through capital accumulation.

This gospel is so deeply embedded that questioning it seems heretical.

## ¶2 The Golden Cage Anomaly

Yet among 180,860 ventures in our panel, we observe a counterintuitive pattern:

| Profile | Early Funding (E) | Flexibility |ΔV| | Y = L/E |
|:--------|:-----------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
| **Escape Velocity** | Low (≤ median) | High (> median) | **3.32×** |
| **Golden Cage** | High (> median) | Low (≤ median) | **0.38×** |
| **Ratio** | - | - | **8.8×** |

Companies with **less** early funding and **more** strategic flexibility achieved **8.8× better outcomes** than those with abundant resources who stayed locked in.

**Notation** (money as flow, not stock):
- **E** = Early funding (first_financing_size)
- **L** = Later funding (Total_2025 - E)
- **Y** = L/E (funding growth ratio)
- **|ΔV|** = |V_L - V_E| (strategic flexibility)

See [[fig3_cohort_analysis.png]] for the visual.

## ¶3 Research Question

> **RQ:** What is the cost of commitment—the forgone outcome from being locked into a strategy?

We ask: holding early funding constant, how much do locked-in companies underperform flexible ones?

---

## ¶4 Counterfactual Cost Framework

We introduce a **Counterfactual Cost of Commitment** estimator:

$$\text{Cost} = E[Y | \text{Locked}, E] - E[Y | \text{Flexible}, E]$$

By conditioning on **same early funding level** (E), we isolate the effect of lock-in. This is not "late bloomers succeed" (대기만성)—it's "**deprivation → flexibility → success**" (결핍 → 유연성 → 성공).

The mechanism is a **chain effect**:
```
E↑ → Promise → σ↓ → |ΔV|↓ → Y↓
```

## ¶5 Key Finding: 8.8× Cost of Commitment

Our main result (**H_cost**):

> **H_cost**: Escape Velocity (3.32×) vs Golden Cage (0.38×) = **8.8× gap**

This holds across all funding deciles, with the average cost at **-2.5×** per decile (see [[fig2_cost_by_decile.png]]). Lock-in hurts at every funding level.

**Supporting evidence** (H_supporting): Lock-in correlation ρ = **-0.117*** between early funding and |ΔV|.
