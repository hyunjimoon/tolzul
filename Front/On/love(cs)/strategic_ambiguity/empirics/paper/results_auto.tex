\section{Results}

\subsection{H1: Early Funding (OLS)}
% Paragraph 23: H1 results
For H1, the coefficient on vagueness is \textcolor{blue}{statistically significant and negative}: $\hat\beta_1 \approx -8.51e-07$ ($p=0.000$). This supports the information cost hypothesis: vague promises reduce early funding by preventing investors from updating beliefs through verifiable milestones.

\subsection{H2: Growth to Series B+ (Logit)}
% Paragraph 24: H2 main effect
For H2, we find a statistically \textcolor{blue}{significant negative main effect of vagueness on growth}: $\hat\alpha_1 \approx -0.0372$ ($p=0.0000$).
The interaction with hardware is negative and statistically significant at the 10\% level: $\hat\alpha_3 \approx -0.0300$ ($p=0.046$). This suggests that exercisability moderates the effect of vagueness on later success.
