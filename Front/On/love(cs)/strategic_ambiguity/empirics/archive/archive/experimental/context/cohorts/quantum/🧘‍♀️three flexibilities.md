| .5          | **Hardware Expert (Superconducting)**_e.g., Kaidong Pang_                     | 1. **On Balancing Specificity and Flexibility:** When starting out, how did you balance the need to present a concrete, fundable business case with the reality that the technology and its applications were still uncertain?<br>2. **On Investor Perception:** In your experience, do investors in quantum hardware prefer a very precise, narrow technical promise? How does this affect your long-term strategy if the market or technology pivots?<br>3. **On Competitive Landscape:** With so many quantum modalities competing, how do you communicate the long-term viability of your chosen approach (superconducting) to stakeholders against other "more flexible" technologies?<br>4. **On Use Cases:** How do you identify and validate potential customer use cases today when the hardware isn't fully mature? Is the focus more on solving a "grand challenge" problem or finding a near-term commercial application? | 1. **Capital Intensity & Strategy:** The conversation mentioned the immense capital cost of superconducting hardware (e.g., dilution refrigerators). How does this high upfront investment directly impact your company's strategic flexibility and ability to pivot compared to less capital-intensive approaches?<br>2. **Engineering Culture vs. Business Strategy:** It was suggested that hardware engineers value precision, which might conflict with a "vague" business promise. Have you experienced this tension between the engineering culture and the need for strategic business agility?<br>3. **Differentiation:** Given that major players like Google and IBM have also bet heavily on superconducting qubits, how does a startup in this space differentiate itself? Is it by building a better qubit, a specific component of the stack, or by targeting a niche application that larger players might overlook?                                         |
| 1           | **Hardware Expert (Neutral Atom / Trapped Ion)**_e.g., Tommaso Macri (QuEra)_ |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1. **"Flexibility" in Practice:** Neutral atom/trapped ion systems are often described as more reconfigurable than superconducting circuits. From a business perspective, how does this technical flexibility actually translate into your strategy? Does it allow you to explore a wider range of applications or adapt more easily to new discoveries?<br>2. **Path to Commercialization:** The transcript mentions QuEra has already delivered hardware to a customer. Could you share your perspective on the journey from a lab prototype to a deliverable product? What were the biggest non-obvious challenges in manufacturing and deployment for this modality?<br>3. **Roadmap to Fault Tolerance:** How do you see the roadmap for neutral atom/trapped ion systems evolving from the current NISQ era towards fault tolerance? Is the path to error correction fundamentally different or perhaps more straightforward for this modality compared to others?     |
| 2           | **Software / Full-Stack Expert**_e.g., from Inflection or IonQ_               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1. **Hardware Abstraction:** My hypothesis is that software companies can afford to be more "vague" or flexible. As a software/full-stack provider, how do you approach building for a future where the winning hardware modality is still unknown? How much of your stack is truly hardware-agnostic versus optimized for a specific modality like trapped ions?<br>2. **Value Creation in the NISQ Era:** The conversation discussed the transition from NISQ to QEC. How does a software company create tangible value for customers _today_ on noisy hardware, while also building the tools (like your QEC library) for the future fault-tolerant era? Is it a hybrid approach, as was discussed?<br>3. **Roadmap Strategy:** Your company published a public roadmap. What is the business strategy behind this transparency? How does it help you manage customer expectations and signal your leadership in a field where timelines are notoriously hard to predict? |
