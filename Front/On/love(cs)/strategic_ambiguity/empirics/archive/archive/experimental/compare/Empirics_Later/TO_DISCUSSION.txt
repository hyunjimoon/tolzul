## 📤 Outputs Passed Forward

### **1. Key Findings**

| Hypothesis | Result | Interpretation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **H2a** | β₃ = −0.85 (p < 0.01) | V×H interaction negative: Hardware firms penalized for vagueness even at later stage |
| **H2b** | β₁ = +0.42 (p < 0.01) | Software firms benefit from vagueness: +9 pp in P(Series B+) per 1 SD |
| **Reversal** | Net HW effect = −0.43 | Vagueness hurts HW (−9 pp) while helping SW (+9 pp) |

### **2. Mechanism Evidence**

**Pivot Frequency Mediation (H2c):**
- Vague SW firms pivot 2× more than precise SW (p < 0.05)
- Vague HW firms pivot no more than precise HW (n.s.)
- Each additional pivot → +12 pp in P(Series B+) (p < 0.01)

### **3. Robustness**

**Specification Curve Results:**
- 200+ model combinations tested
- β₃ < 0 in 187/200 specs (93.5%)
- Median β₃ = −0.82 (close to baseline)
- Significant (p < 0.05) in 165/200 specs (82.5%)

## 🎯 Key Points for Discussion Section

### **Theoretical Implications**

1. **Temporal Reversal Mechanism:**
   - Early stage: VOI dominates → precision signals credibility
   - Later stage: RO value emerges → vagueness preserves flexibility
   - **Critical Boundary Condition:** Architecture (HW vs. SW) determines when RO value can be realized

2. **Reconciling Two Schools:**
   - **Information School (Zuckerman, Hannan):** Correct at Series A
   - **Options School (Pontikes, Granqvist):** Correct at Series B+, but only for low-friction architectures
   - **Our Integration:** Time × Architecture interaction, not universal trade-off

3. **Exercisability as Moderator:**
   - RO theory often assumes "options can be exercised"
   - We show: Physical rigidity (HW) blocks option exercise even when option exists
   - Implication: RO value is **architecture-contingent**, not just **uncertainty-contingent**

### **Managerial Implications**

1. **Promise Design Rules:**
   - **If HW:** Be precise early AND late (VOI always dominates)
   - **If SW:** Start vague (preserve pivots), then precision as you learn (signal commitment)
   
2. **Pivot Planning:**
   - Vagueness ≠ strategic unless paired with low switching costs
   - HW founders: Precision forces better ex-ante search (fewer, better-informed pivots)
   - SW founders: Vagueness enables rapid experimentation (more, cheaper pivots)

3. **Investor Evaluation:**
   - Series A: Penalize vagueness uniformly (correct heuristic)
   - Series B+: Conditional on architecture:
     - SW with pivots → vagueness was strategic learning
     - HW with pivots → vagueness was indecision (red flag)

### **Limitations to Address**

1. **Selection Bias:**
   - Only observe firms that got Series A (Heckman correction in appendix)
   - Survivors may differ systematically

2. **External Validity:**
   - Quantum computing is high-uncertainty context (amplifies effects)
   - Generalize to other deep-tech industries? (check in robustness)

3. **Vagueness Measurement:**
   - Text-based proxy may miss oral communication
   - Inter-rater reliability κ = 0.82 (good but not perfect)
