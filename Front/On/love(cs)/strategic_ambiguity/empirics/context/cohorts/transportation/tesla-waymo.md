| Category           | Waymo                                                                           | Tesla                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Geography          | Works only in small geo‑fenced Level‑4 regions (Phoenix, SF, LA, limited areas) | Operates nearly anywhere as Level‑2 FSD with no geographic restriction       |
| Mapping & Approach | Heavy reliance on HD maps + large amounts of hand‑coded logic                   | End‑to‑end AI (FSD v12), no HD maps needed                                   |
| Sensors            | ~50 sensors (lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic) → very complex                  | Primarily cameras + simple hardware; minimal sensors                         |
| Cost               | Sensor suite alone estimated $40–50K per vehicle → hard to scale                | Low‑cost, scalable hardware makes mass deployment feasible                   |
| Data               | <1,000 vehicles in limited cities → narrow data                                 | Hundreds of thousands of vehicles; 500M+ FSD miles → broad, diverse data     |
| Overall Assessment | Strong in limited zones but expensive & slow to scale                           | Cheaper, scalable, and likely to expand faster; argued to be the true leader |
