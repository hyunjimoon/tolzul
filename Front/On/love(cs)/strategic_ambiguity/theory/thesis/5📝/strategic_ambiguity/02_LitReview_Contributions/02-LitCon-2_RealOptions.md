Our work is also connected to a growing body of literature that examines the impact of online (grocery) shopping from a sustainability perspective. Several studies have modeled the environmental consequences of online shopping, focusing on travel-related emissions from shipping non-food products and finding that online shopping can reduce transportation-related carbon emissions (e.g. Weideli and Cheikhrouhou (2013), Carling et al. (2015), Carlsson et al. (2016)). More specific to the context of food waste are Astashkina et al. (2019), Belavina et al. (2017), and Ilyuk (2018). Astashkina et al. (2019) consider both transportation and food waste emissions in the context of online grocery shopping, showing that food waste emissions can outweigh transportation emissions and that online grocery shopping could reduce total emissions by 8–41% compared to brick-and-mortar stores. Belavina et al. (2017) use a theoretical model to suggest that subscription-based revenue models in online grocery retail promote smaller and more frequent orders, leading to less waste. Ilyuk (2018) finds, based on an online experiment using a mock website, that food purchased online is more likely to be wasted due to lower perceptions of purchase and a diminished sense of psychological ownership. While these studies offer valuable insights, they primarily rely on theoretical or simulated experimental data. In contrast, our study uses large-scale consumer panel data from 2017 to 2019 and employs an instrumental variable approach to provide empirical evidence to the causal relationship between online grocery shopping frequency and household food waste.
