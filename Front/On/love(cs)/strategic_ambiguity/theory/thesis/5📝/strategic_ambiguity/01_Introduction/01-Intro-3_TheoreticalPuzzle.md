It seems natural to think that an entrepreneur's primary communication goal should be maximum clarity (minimum variance), largely to solve the credibility problem: should a stakeholder believe the promise being made? From this perspective, a precise promise appears more credible. It avoids adding noise to an already challenging environment, signals the founder's clarity of thought, and demonstrates technical competence, particularly to those with an engineering mindset. By offering a concrete, verifiable target, a precise promise reduces the perceived risk for investors and customers, making it a "promise you can believe in." Yet, entrepreneurs systematically employ ambiguity in their communications. Recent empirical work suggests this is not accidental, but strategic. For instance, El-Zayaty et al. (2025) find that vague language can enhance resource acquisition when paired with strong founder credentials. This creates a puzzle: if precision is the answer to the credibility problem, why is ambiguity so prevalent and apparently effective? Existing theory provides limited guidance on when, why, and how much ambiguity is optimal.

The effect of online grocery shopping on household food waste is multifaceted, with competing perspectives in the literature. 
- Some suggest that the convenience of online platforms can encourage more frequent, smaller purchases, potentially reducing waste (Belavina et al. 2017). In addition, online shopping may limit exposure to in-store displays and sensory cues, supporting healthier and less impulsive food choices (Huyghe et al. 2017). 
- Conversely, others argue that the lack of physical interaction with products can lead to misjudging quantities and over-purchasing. For example, Ilyuk (2018) finds that consumers may be more likely to waste food purchased online due to a weaker sense of psychological ownership. While these arguments highlight important considerations, there remains a need for robust quantitative evidence. This study seeks to address this gap by providing the first empirical analysis of the causal relationship between online grocery shopping and household-level food waste.
