This paper develops a formal model to resolve this tension by analyzing the trade-off between mobilizing support with precise commitments and preserving adaptability through strategic ambiguity. We analyze a situation where an entrepreneur must make a public promise about a key quality attribute—like battery range—to a market of potential resource providers (e.g., customers). We model this promise as a strategic communication with two components: an expected quality level (mean, $\mu$) and a degree of variance ($\sigma^2$). We conceptualize this promise as a social prior: a publicly articulated distribution that serves as a focal point for coordination among all stakeholders, including the entrepreneur. Unlike a classical Bayesian prior that represents an agent's static, internal state of knowledge, this social prior is a strategically chosen variable, constructed to optimize the venture's success in the face of shared uncertainty. The promise is thus a tool for both persuasion and coordination.

In particular, we leverage the NielsenIQ consumer panel data comprising transaction records from 994 retailers across more than 59,000 households. 
- To prevent our results from being confounded by the surge in online grocery shopping during the pandemic, our analysis focuses on data from 2017 to 2019. Employing an instrumental variable approach with two-stage regression, we estimate the causal effect of online shopping frequency on a proxy for household food waste, defined as the average purchased quantity per capita divided by the number of inter-trip days. 
- To address the potential endogeneity of online grocery shopping frequency, we employ two instrumental variables: the household’s own online shopping frequency in the previous year, and the average online shopping frequency among neighboring households in the same 2-digit zip code. These instruments respectively capture individual behavioral persistence and community-level adoption patterns, providing orthogonal and plausibly exogenous sources of variation.
