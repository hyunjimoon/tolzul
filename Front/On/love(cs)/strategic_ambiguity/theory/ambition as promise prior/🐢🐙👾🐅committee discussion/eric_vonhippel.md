# 2025

## Nov.

I’ve been reflecting on our conversation, and particularly on your candid feedback about my weakness in understanding what other people need. I appreciate you raising it, as it's a critical area for development.

While I take your point seriously, I wanted to share a recent project that gives me hope. I've attached a short document I wrote to bridge the research worlds of Scott Stern and Josh Tenenbaum. My explicit goal was to infer their respective intellectual needs to propose a viable collaboration on "Bayesian Entrepreneurship."

To do this, I effectively ran a form of "inverse planning":

1. I curated their individual research trajectories, tracing them from divergent origins to convergent pathways.
2. This allowed me to identify a core **need** in Scott's work (a formal model for how entrepreneurs form beliefs under uncertainty) and a corresponding **tool** from Josh's work (resource-rational inference algorithms).

The effort was well-received. Scott found the synthesis stimulating, and it helped both of their groups identify productive differences and common ground. This experience suggests I _can_ successfully infer and map others' needs when I dedicate myself to the process.

My primary challenge, as you correctly identified, has been with Charlie. As his student, I struggled to frame my work to "fill the hole" in his specific research agenda at the right pace. With engineering background, I lacked understanding on how wide the gap between operations and strategy field was. Moreover, the transportation phd program, which was the only chance I had  The context from the attached transcript is that I didn't successfully align my operational modeling methodology with his strategy-domain questions in a way he found compelling. I bet on a "leap of faith" with my interdisciplinary approach, which didn't quite land within his immediate frame.

So, I believe the issue is less a fundamental inability to understand others, and more a challenge in execution and adaptation under the specific constraints and timelines of my PhD work with Charlie.

Your advice remains invaluable, and I am focused on making this a more consistent strength. Thank you again for helping me see the pattern.

I felt ashamed this morning discovering my mail below wasn't sent. I sincerely apologize.

> I checked your office for mails as requested, and could not find any. There used to be a mailbox for TIES faculty in the location below, but it’s gone. Will ask around, check, then follow up. (Aug.26)

In September, I asked Kimberely and checked the group mailbox on the sixth floor, but couldn't find any.

Yesterday, I found two new mails (eric mail oct.png attached).

P.S. I can't be excused, but if I may add a brief context.. 

I failed my first qualification exam last May. Fortunately, my committee gave me a second chance to retake the exam so I'm focusing on 轉禍爲福, which means _change 轉 adversity 禍 by acting it 爲 into prosperity 福._

  
Although I designed failure by forming a committee with individuals holding incompatible theories but a similar contrarian spirit, it was still a painful summer trying to produce research that would be accepted by all four of them. Believe it or not, spending my whole summer in your office, calmed my fear.
