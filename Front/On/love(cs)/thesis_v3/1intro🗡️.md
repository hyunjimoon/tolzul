# Introduction: When Strategic Ambiguity Pays

## 1. The Paradox of Promise Precision

In 2008, Tesla approached investors with a deliberately imprecise promise: electric vehicles with "over 200 miles of range." This formulation—a lower bound rather than a specific target—preserved flexibility for battery technology iteration while securing $40 million in Series C funding. By 2025, Tesla's market capitalization exceeded $600 billion, having never met a single production deadline yet consistently exceeding their vague performance promises through over-the-air updates. Meanwhile, Better Place raised $850 million with precise battery-swapping specifications and comprehensive infrastructure plans, only to fail spectacularly in 2013. This paradox—that vagueness sometimes outperforms precision in venture funding—challenges fundamental assumptions about how entrepreneurs should communicate with investors.

## 2. The Stakes: A $2.6 Trillion Market in Flux

The mobility sector represents an ideal laboratory for examining promise precision, with McKinsey projecting a $2.6 trillion market by 2030. Yet approximately 90% of mobility startups fail to reach Series B, with "premature scaling"—committing resources before validating product-market fit—cited as the leading cause (Startup Genome, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic amplified this dynamic: ventures maintaining flexibility in their value propositions, like Uber's pivot to delivery, successfully adapted, while those locked into specific promises, like autonomous shuttle services, struggled to survive. Understanding when precision helps versus hurts has become essential for both entrepreneurs crafting pitches and investors evaluating opportunities in rapidly evolving markets.

## 3. Theoretical Tension: Information vs Options

Two intellectual traditions offer conflicting guidance on promise precision. Information economics suggests that precise commitments solve entrepreneurship's fundamental credibility problem: investors cannot distinguish genuine opportunities from "lemons" without verifiable signals (Spence, 1973; Akerlof, 1970). From this perspective, vague promises should universally harm funding by increasing information asymmetry. Real options theory reaches the opposite conclusion: under uncertainty, preserving flexibility creates value by enabling future adaptation (McGrath, 1999; Baldwin & Clark, 2000). This theoretical contradiction demands resolution: When does the information cost of vagueness outweigh its option value?

## 4. Our Approach: Endogenous Quality and Consideration Sets

We propose a novel framework where **idea quality is not fixed but constructed through the interaction between founder flexibility and market feedback**. Drawing on operational insights about learning-by-doing (Fine, 1986) and absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990), we argue that vagueness proxies for the founder's **consideration set size**—the range of strategic pivots they preserve. Using computational linguistics to analyze 137,597 venture descriptions from PitchBook (2021-2025), we measure promise vagueness through categorical ambiguity and concreteness deficits. We then track funding outcomes across stages, exploiting variation in exercisability between software (high flexibility) and hardware (low flexibility) architectures.

## 5. Key Findings: The Attenuation Effect

Our analysis reveals a nuanced pattern that challenges both theoretical camps. Rather than the hypothesized temporal reversal—where vagueness hurts early but helps later—we find that **vagueness consistently imposes costs, but these costs are attenuated by exercisability**. Specifically: (1) At Series A, vagueness shows no significant penalty regardless of architecture, contrary to information theory predictions; (2) At Series B+, vagueness reduces success probability by approximately 7.8% for hardware ventures but only 4.1% for software ventures; (3) This differential effect, while not reaching conventional significance (p=0.19), suggests that flexibility partially offsets information costs rather than creating net positive value. These findings imply that **strategic ambiguity is less about creating option value and more about minimizing coordination costs** when pivots become necessary.

## 6. Theoretical Contributions

This paper makes three contributions to entrepreneurship theory. First, we **reconcile information economics and real options perspectives** by introducing the concept of "earned precision"—entrepreneurs optimally maintain vagueness not to preserve options but to avoid premature coordination costs with stakeholders. Second, we **reconceptualize idea quality as endogenous**, emerging from the interaction between initial promises and market learning rather than existing as an ex-ante property ventures signal. Third, we **identify exercisability as a boundary condition** that determines whether vagueness creates strategic value or simply confusion. These insights extend work on strategic ambiguity (Eisenhardt, 1990), architectural innovation (Henderson & Clark, 1990), and the discovery-driven planning literature (McGrath & MacMillan, 1995).

## 7. Practical Implications and Roadmap

For entrepreneurs, our findings suggest a counterintuitive strategy: **calibrate promise precision not to funding stage but to pivot capability**. When reconfiguration costs are high—as in hardware ventures requiring custom manufacturing—specificity remains optimal despite its constraints. When experimentation is cheap—as in software with modular architectures—measured ambiguity can preserve strategic flexibility without severe funding penalties. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature and positions our contribution; Section 3 develops our conceptual model of endogenous quality; Section 4 describes our data and computational measurement approach; Section 5 presents empirical results including robustness tests across 100+ specifications; Section 6 discusses implications for theory, practice, and ecosystem design.
