## 1. Table 2 v4: Autonomous Vehicles Cohort (2015-2018)

|Company|Founded|T=1 Promise (Year)|Series A|Series B / Outcome|Total Raised|Status|Vagueness|Integration Cost|Hypothesis Context|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Wayve**|2017|"End-to-end AI for generalised autonomy at global scale" (2017 blog)|$20M (2020)|$200M (2022) multi-city|$1.3B|Success|Vague|Medium (camera-only)|Vague "embodied AI" preserved flexibility → multi-city deployment|
|**Argo AI**|2016|"Level 4 self-driving by 2021" (2017 Ford announcement)|$1B Ford (2017)|$2.6B VW (2019)|$3.6B|Failed 2022|Precise|High (Ford/VW integration)|Precise 2021 timeline mobilized $3.6B but rigidity → overpromise fail|
|**Aurora**|2017|"Aurora Driver software platform" (2017 founding)|$90M (2018)|$530M (2019) trucking|$2B+|SPAC 2021|Vague|High (trucking hardware)|Vague "Driver" branding enabled pivot freight→robotaxi→back|
|**Nuro**|2016|"Autonomous delivery vehicles for last-mile logistics" (2016)|$92M (2018)|$940M (2019) Kroger pilots|$2B+|Success|Precise|Medium (purpose-built bots)|Precise use case (delivery) + narrow scope → real deployments|
|**Ghost Autonomy**|2017|"Highway autopilot kit available in 2020" (2019 public launch)|$63.7M (2019)|$100M (2021) pivot crash prevention|$220M|Failed 2024|Precise|High (consumer hardware kit)|Precise 2020 timeline + hardware commitment → pivot too late → fail|
|**May Mobility**|2017|"Autonomous shuttle service for campuses/cities" (2017)|$11.5M (2018)|$83M (2021) deployments|$200M+|Success|Precise|Low (drive-by-wire shuttles)|Precise shuttle use case + low-speed niche → successful deployments|
|**Drive.ai**|2015|"Deep learning approach to self-driving" (Stanford 2015)|$50M (2017)|Struggled|$77M|Acquired Apple 2019|Vague|High (full-stack AV)|Vague tech approach (no product clarity) → no traction → acqui-hire|
|**Zoox**|2014|"Bidirectional autonomous vehicle for urban transport" (2014)|$80M (2016)|$500M (2018)|$1B+|Acquired Amazon $1.2B|Precise|Ultra-high (custom vehicle)|Precise vehicle design mobilized capital but burned $1B → acquired|
|**Pony.ai**|2016|"Robotaxi service in Beijing and US markets" (2016)|$112M (2018)|$267M (2020) Beijing pilots|$1B+|Success|Precise|High (dual-market ops)|Precise geo strategy (China+US) → successful Beijing deployment|
|**Cruise**|2013|"Highway autopilot kit for consumer cars" (2013)|GM $1B (2016)|GM $1.15B (2018)|$10B+ (GM funding)|Active (paused)|Precise|High (GM integration)|Precise consumer kit → pivoted robotaxi but 2023 accident → pause|

**Summary Statistics:**

- Precise: 6 companies (Success: 2, Fail: 2, Acquired: 2)
- Vague: 4 companies (Success: 1, Fail: 1, Active: 2)
- Integration cost range: Low (shuttles) → Ultra-high (custom vehicles)
- Funding range: $77M (Drive.ai) → $10B+ (Cruise/GM)

## 2. Table 2 변천사

**초기 선택 (암묵적 v1):**

- Wayve, Ghost, Cruise, Argo AI, Zoox, Nuro, Aurora, Pony.ai, May Mobility, Drive.ai 선정
- 2015-2018 founding window, post-AlphaGo deep learning era

**Claude의 오판 → Gemini 교정:**

- Claude 주장: "모두 vague" ("embodied AI", "deep learning" 등)
- Gemini 반박: Argo AI "2021 deployment", Ghost "2020 kit", Nuro "delivery vehicles" = precise
- 결론: 원래 선택이 이미 IV variation 우수 (Precise 6, Vague 4)

**v4:** 상세 정보 추가

- T=1 promise, funding, integration cost, hypothesis context 명시
- 변경 없이 detail만 확장
