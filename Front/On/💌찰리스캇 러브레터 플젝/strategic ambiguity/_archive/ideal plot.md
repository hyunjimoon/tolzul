# Temporal Tradeoff Hypothesis: Vague vs. Precise Promises in Entrepreneurship

## Core Hypothesis

Entrepreneurial success depends on matching language precision to funding stage. The optimal communication strategy reverses between early and late stages:

**Early Stage (Series A):**
- Vague promises → HIGHER probability of funding
- Precise promises → LOWER probability of funding

**Later Stage (Series B):**
- Vague promises → LOWER probability of funding  
- Precise promises → HIGHER probability of funding

### Plot Structure

**X-axis:** Time/Funding Stage (t)
- Left: Series A (early stage)
- Right: Series B (later stage)

**Y-axis:** Probability of Funding

**Two Lines:**
1. **Vague Promise** (red line): Starts high at Series A, decreases to low at Series B
2. **Precise Promise** (black line): Starts low at Series A, increases to high at Series B

**Critical Crossover:** Lines intersect between Series A and B, indicating the optimal point to shift communication strategy

## Theoretical Mechanism

### Why Vague Promises Work Early (Series A)
- High uncertainty justifies flexibility
- Investors value option value over commitment
- Business model still crystallizing
- Allows pivoting without credibility loss
- Multiple stakeholder interpretations beneficial

### Why Precise Promises Work Later (Series B)
- Reduced uncertainty enables verification
- Investors need coordination and commitment signals
- Business model validation completed
- Track record supports specific forecasts
- Scale-up requires irreversible commitments

## Data Requirements to Test This

To empirically validate this hypothesis, we need:

1. **Longitudinal venture data** tracking same firms across multiple funding rounds
2. **Language precision metrics** extracted from pitch materials at each round:
   - Pitch decks
   - Executive summaries
   - Investor presentations
   - Founder interviews/transcripts
3. **Funding outcomes** at each stage:
   - Success/failure to raise
   - Amount raised
   - Valuation
   - Investor quality
4. **Controls for confounds:**
   - Founder characteristics (experience, education, networks)
   - Market conditions (VIX, sector trends)
   - Firm characteristics (technology, team size, prior funding)
   - Investor characteristics (sophistication, sector focus)

## Connection to Existing Literature

This hypothesis bridges:
- **Commitment-flexibility tradeoff** (Agrawal et al. 2021)
- **Strategic vagueness** (El-Zayaty et al. 2025)
- **Business model crystallization** (Novelli et al. 2024)
- **Uncertainty type transitions** (Packard et al. 2017)

Unlike existing studies that examine cross-sectional effects, this hypothesis proposes a **dynamic reversal** where the sign of the vagueness effect flips over time.

## Research Gap

No existing study has:
- Tracked language precision longitudinally across funding rounds
- Demonstrated temporal reversal of vagueness effects
- Shown interaction between stage and precision on outcomes
- Formally modeled optimal precision evolution

## Next Steps

1. Identify datasets with longitudinal pitch + funding data
2. Develop/validate language precision measures suitable for time-series
3. Test interaction: Stage × Precision → Funding Success
4. Model optimal precision transition timing
