## Table 3 v4: 3D Printing Hardware Cohort (2009-2015)

|Company|Founded|T=1 Promise (Year)|Series A|Series B / Outcome|Total Raised|Status|Vagueness|Integration Cost|Hypothesis Context|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Formlabs**|2011|"25 micron layers, 300 micron detail, 125x125x165mm, $2,299" (KS 2012)|$19M (2013)|$35M (2015) enterprise|$200M+|Success|Precise|Low (modular SLA)|Precise numerical specs mobilized $2.9M KS + delivered → Success|
|**Printrbot**|2011|"$499 kit, 4x4x4 inch build, 40hr assembly" (KS 2011)|$830K (KS)|N/A|$830K|Failed 2018|Precise|Low (FDM kit)|Precise price point mobilized $830K but commodity competition → Fail|
|**Carbon**|2013|"25-100x faster DLS, engineering-grade materials" (TC Disrupt 2014)|$41M (2014)|$100M (2015) GV-led|$680M|Success ($2.4B)|Precise|Medium (CLIP chemistry)|Precise speed claims + breakthrough tech (Adidas) → Success|
|**Markforged**|2013|"Carbon fiber reinforced, 6x stronger than ABS" (2013)|$30M (2015)|$82M (2016) metal launch|$294M|IPO 2021|Precise|Medium (composite)|Precise material differentiation carved niche → IPO|
|**Desktop Metal**|2015|"Metal binder jet, 100x faster than LPBF" (2015)|$97M (2017)|$115M (2017) production|$438M|Troubled (stock -90%)|Precise|High (metal production)|Precise overpromise on production readiness → Execution gap|
|**Velo3D**|2014|"Support-free metal printing for aerospace geometries" (2014)|$22M (2016)|$40M (2018) Sapphire|$640M|Troubled (SPAC -95%)|Precise|High (aerospace calibration)|Precise technical claim but niche market + high i → Troubled|
|**Relativity Space**|2015|"3D print entire rocket, 95% fewer parts, Terran 1 by 2020" (YC W16)|$35M (2017)|$140M (2019) test flights|$1.3B|Success|Precise|Ultra-high (aerospace)|Precise timeline (missed 2020) but highest i + persistence → Success|
|**MakerBot**|2009|"Make anything...democratize manufacturing" (2009)|$10M (2011) Bezos|$10M (2011)|$100M+ before acquisition|Acquired $403M (2013)|Vague|Low (RepRap origins)|Vague vision + low i enabled pivots (kits→Replicator) → Acquired|
|**Ultimaker**|2011|"3D printing for everyone...open-source community" (RepRap 2011)|$14M (2014)|$27M (2016) education|$180M|Merged 2022|Vague|Low (open FDM)|Vague democratization but competitive squeeze → Merged with MakerBot|
|**B9Creations**|2012|"Jewelry and dental 3D printing platform" (KS 2012)|$3M (2013)|Slow growth|<$10M|Struggling|Vague|Medium (niche DLP)|Vague market positioning (jewelry OR dental?) → No focus → Struggling|

**Summary Statistics:**

- Precise: 7 companies (Success: 4, Fail/Troubled: 3)
- Vague: 3 companies (Success: 1, Pivot: 1, Fail: 1)
- Integration cost range: Low (FDM kits) → Ultra-high (rockets)
- Funding range: $830K (Printrbot) → $1.3B (Relativity)

## 2. Table 3 변천사

**v1 → v2:** DV variation 문제 (모두 성공)

- 문제: 원본 10개가 Formlabs, Carbon, Markforged 등 성공 기업만 포함
- 해결: 3D Hubs, Shapeways, Materialise 추가하여 fail/pivot 사례 확보

**v2 → v3:** IV variation 문제 (vague가 모두 service/platform)

- 문제: Vague 회사들이 hardware가 아닌 marketplace/service → confounding
- 해결: Prusa를 B9Creations로 교체 (hardware-only cohort 유지)
- 이유: Prusa는 bootstrap (no VC) → Series B 데이터 없음

**v3 → v4:** 상세 정보 추가

- 각 회사의 T=1 텍스트, funding timeline, hypothesis context 추가
- 분석 준비 완료
