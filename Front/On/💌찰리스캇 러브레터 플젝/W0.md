Dear Charlie and Scott,

I'm writing to share my commitment to scholarship and to express gratitude for the last two meetings.

Thanks to your guidance, I’ve been able to reflect deeply and realign my perspective. I’ve gained a clearer understanding of what you mean by academic community, economic modeling, theory, empirics, strategy, and operations. More importantly, the joy of taking the organizational economics class and recognizing familiar names among Nobel laureates in Economics helped me question my bias against economics and overcome my fear of becoming a management scholar.

When Scott mentioned "Commitment and flexibility for entrepreneurs in an era of ferment," I immediately sensed it was the language I had been searching for. My heart beats with the same excitement I feel every time I read your two attached papers. This curiosity attracts me to a management scholarship.

As I work through hypothesizing, building regression models, and exploring data, I’m encountering many surprises which I'm excited to share in a follow-up mail!

Best,  
Angie
