# W3-실증: Initial Results

**Subject**: [Empirical] Week 3: Initial Results

---

Dear Charlie and Scott,

**Progress This Week:**

✅ **Models 1-2 Estimated**

*Model 1 (Reversal hypothesis):*
```
logit(Funding_Success_it) = β₀ + β₁·Vagueness_i + β₂·SeriesB_t 
                          + β₃·(Vagueness × SeriesB) + Controls
```

**Results:**
- β₁ (Vagueness main effect) = -0.028 (p = 0.04) → Vague firms struggle at Series A ✓
- β₂ (SeriesB main effect) = -1.35 (p < 0.001) → Series B harder overall ✓
- β₃ (Vagueness × SeriesB) = +0.042 (p = 0.02) → Reversal confirmed ✓

**Interpretation:**
- At Series A: 1 SD increase in vagueness → 14% lower funding probability
- At Series B: Same vagueness → 8% *higher* funding probability (among Series A survivors)
- **Reversal pattern supported**: Vagueness hurts early, helps later

*Model 2 (Integration cost moderator):*
```
Model 1 + β₇·(Vagueness × SeriesB × High_Integration_Cost)
```

**Results:**
- β₇ (Three-way interaction) = +0.063 (p = 0.08) → Marginally significant
- Direction consistent with hypothesis (hardware firms benefit more from vagueness)

**Interpretation:**
- Hardware firms with vague promises: +12% Series B success vs. precise hardware firms
- Software firms with vague promises: +5% Series B success vs. precise software firms
- **Integration cost moderates reversal**: Effect stronger for high-commitment ventures ✓

✅ **Robustness Checks Initiated**

*Alternative vagueness measures:*
- Word count variance (high word count = vague) → Results hold
- Hedge word frequency ("approximately," "around") → Results hold
- Technical jargon density (low jargon = vague) → Results weaker but directionally consistent

*Sample sensitivity:*
- Exclude top/bottom 5% vagueness → Results hold
- Exclude firms with <$1M Series A → Results strengthen (larger effect sizes)

*Diagnostics:*
- VIF < 2.5 for all predictors (no multicollinearity)
- Cook's D < 0.5 for all cases (no influential outliers)
- Pseudo R² = 0.28 (reasonable fit for logistic model)

⏳ **In Progress**
- Visualization: Reversal curves (vagueness × funding probability by stage)
- Visualization: Moderator effects (hardware vs. software trajectories)
- Table construction: Tables 1-3 for draft

---

**Next Week Target:**
Complete visualizations (Figures 1-2), draft results section connecting findings to Clockspeed/S-curve frameworks.

Best,
Angie

## 작성 가이드 (당신이 채울 때)

**실제 결과로 교체할 부분:**

1. **모든 계수와 p-values**: β₁ = -0.028 (p = 0.04) → 실제 회귀 결과
2. **해석 수치들**: "14% lower" → 실제 marginal effects 계산값
3. **Pseudo R²**: 0.28 → 실제 모델 fit

**만약 결과가 가설과 반대면:**

```
**Results:**
- β₁ (Vagueness main effect) = +0.018 (p = 0.32) → Not significant
- β₃ (Vagueness × SeriesB) = -0.012 (p = 0.54) → Reversal not supported

**Interpretation:**
- Hypothesis not supported in this sample
- Possible explanations: [list 2-3 reasons]
- Alternative specifications under exploration
```

**정직하게 보고하되, constructive하게:**
- 결과가 안 나와도 괜찮음 ("The goal is to connect hypothesis to test" - Scott's words)
- "Not supported" ≠ "Failed" 
- 대안 설명 제시

**만약 analysis가 아직 안 끝났으면:**

```
⏳ **Models 1-2 Running**
- Logistic regression syntax validated
- Convergence achieved for Model 1
- Model 2 estimation in progress (computational issues with three-way interaction)

**Preliminary results (Model 1 only):**
- β₁ = [preliminary estimate] (significance pending bootstrap SE)

**Next steps:**
- Complete Model 2 by end of week
- Run robustness checks next week
```

**톤:**
- Factual, 숫자 중심
- 결과에 대한 해석은 간단히 (깊은 논의는 대면 미팅에서)
- "Supported ✓" or "Not supported" 명확히

**핵심:**
가장 정직하게, 실제 결과를 보고하는 것이 목표.
