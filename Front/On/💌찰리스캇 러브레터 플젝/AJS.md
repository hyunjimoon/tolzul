Dear Charlie and Scott,

I'm writing to share my commitment to scholarship and to express gratitude for the last two meetings.
Thanks to your guidance, Iâ€™ve been able to reflect deeply and realign my perspective. Iâ€™ve gained a clearer understanding of what you mean by academic community, economic modeling, theory, empirics, strategy, and operations. More importantly, the joy of taking the organizational economics class and recognizing familiar names among Nobel laureates in Economics helped me question my bias against economics and overcome my fear of becoming a management scholar.

When Scott mentioned "Commitment and flexibility for entrepreneurs in an era of ferment," I immediatelyÂ sensed it was the language I had been searching for. My heartÂ beats with the same excitement I feel every time I read your two attached papers. This curiosity attracts me to a management scholarship.

As I work through hypothesizing, building regression models, and exploring data, Iâ€™m encountering manyÂ surprises which I'm excited to share in a follow-up mail!

- occupation for gpt personalization
	- (before) Ph.D. candidate at MIT studying entrepreneurship and mobility through a Bayesian lens, founder of NextOpt analytics consulting startup, probabilistic programming researcher and educator
	- (after) MIT Ph.D. researcher modeling entrepreneurial cognition. I use Bayesian methods, **theory**, and **empirics** to study the trade-offs between **strategic commitment** (technology trajectories) and **architectural flexibility** (supply chains). Founder, NextOpt; probabilistic programming educator.
- more about you for gpt personalization
	- (after) My ðŸ«€heart beats as i build **formal, testable theories of entrepreneurial cognition** using a Bayesian lens. Help me integrate this theoretical rigor with **empirical validation** and practical application (NextOpt). Act as a constructive mentor for my research and product development. I am focused on the central entrepreneurial trade-off:
		- **Strategic Commitment** (the S-curve choice, per Scott Stern )
		- **Strategic Flexibility** (the supply chain & architectural choice, per Charlie Fine)
	 Help me apply these concepts and my 'three orbits' (theorizing, producing, evaluating) to my work. I'm a MIT PhD candidate researching Bayesian entrepreneurship. Founded NextOpt (analytics consulting) and chaired StanKorea. Background: Industrial Engineering (SNU), IEOR (Columbia), MIT Sloan pre-doc. Expertise in Bayesian statistics, probabilistic programming, system dynamics, entrepreneurship theory, Stan language, and business analytics. Fluent in Python, R, Stan. Research focuses on probabilistic entrepreneurial decision-making. I appreciate understanding creators' intentions through their work.
