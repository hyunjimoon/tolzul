# W1-실증: Data Acquisition Progress

**발송일**: Tuesday, October 29, 2024 (저녁 6-8pm)
**Subject**: [Empirical] Week 1: Data Acquisition

---

Dear Charlie and Scott,

**Progress This Week:**

✅ **Data Source Confirmed**
- Secured access to comprehensive private capital database (Pitchbook)
- Sample frame identified: 60-80 AI/ML infrastructure firms
- Time window: 2021-22 Series A cohort → 2023-25 Series B outcomes
- Domain rationale: Clean natural experiment (boom → shakeout period)

✅ **Variable Design Complete**

*Independent variable:*
- **Vagueness**: Text analysis of founder communications using certitude scoring (following El-Zayaty et al. 2025 methodology)
- Operationalization: 100 - LIWC certitude score on company descriptions

*Moderator:*
- **Integration cost**: Hardware/chip/robotics firms (high) vs. software/API firms (low)
- Classification via keyword presence in company descriptions and technology tags

*Outcome variable:*
- **Funding success**: DealSize > 0 at both Series A and Series B stages
- Panel structure: Each firm observed twice (A and B rounds)

✅ **Domain Selection Justified**
- **Why AI/ML, not EV/AV**: 
  - AI/ML has true moderator variance (hardware vs. software firms coexist)
  - EV/AV lacks software-only comparison group
  - 2021-22 boom → 2023-25 adjustment provides natural test of Fine's "era of ferment" dynamics

⏳ **In Progress**
- Data extraction from Pitchbook (company descriptions + deal records)
- VCRound identification logic: Using DealType filters + deal size thresholds + temporal sequencing
- Manual validation sample (20% random check for ambiguous cases)

---

**Next Week Target:**
Complete dataset construction, generate descriptive statistics (Table 1).

Best,
Angie

## 작성 가이드 (당신이 채울 때)

**실제 진행 상황에 맞춰 조정할 부분:**

1. **Sample size**: "60-80 firms" → 실제로 확보한 숫자로 업데이트
2. **Data access**: "Secured access" → 만약 아직 안 되었으면 "Finalizing access to..."
3. **In Progress 섹션**: 가장 정직하게, 실제로 지금 하고 있는 것만 쓰기
4. **Next Week Target**: 현실적으로 달성 가능한 목표만

**톤 유지:**
- 짧고 factual (200단어 이하)
- 완료(✅) vs. 진행중(⏳) 명확히 구분
- No excuses, just facts
- Confident but not overconfident

**만약 진행이 예상보다 느리면:**
```
⏳ **In Progress**
- Data access negotiations ongoing (Pitchbook licensing)
- Alternative sources under evaluation (Crunchbase, manual collection)
- Variable operationalization refined based on data availability

**Revised Target:**
Secure data access by next week, begin extraction.
```

정직하게 쓰되, forward-looking tone 유지하기.
