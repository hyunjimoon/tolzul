‚≠êÔ∏èONLY OF SUBSET OF ACTION IS AVAILABLE

each eaction is productive
even if the agent does the wrong thing, agent should be fired

common except, 

elicit information (agent knows all) - not about experimentation

the moment agent choose productive action, then on the prinipal label as productive (knowledge)

provent to be successful, 


- choose an action and the env. has probability with pro
- ‚≠êÔ∏èrelation is becoming more valuable - choose productive actions more often
- as long as we experiment, the relation is fragile (to get the agent to experimnt)

if you have money (use money to incentivize)

conflict to arise in equilibrium path ()

- need private knwoledge principal 
- availability of the action is where üçÄluck comes in
- different 
- principal (productive, unproductive)
- secon bullet produce ppd, 

- relation and routines are all 
- pitched itself as models of ppd
- intuition is very specific (firing business)
- NOT experiment but elicitation of knowledge - as agent already knows which is productive
