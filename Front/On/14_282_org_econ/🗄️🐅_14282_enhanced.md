## 💡 Meta-Insights Across Modules

### 🔄 Formal-Relational Interaction
**Pattern**: Formal contracts and relational contracts are **complements**, not substitutes

**Memorable**: *"Paper and trust work together"*

### 🌐 Boundaries Are Endogenous
**Pattern**: Integration decisions depend on transaction costs, hold-up, and relationship strength
- M4: Integration when hold-up is severe
- M5: Non-integration when relationships sustain cooperation

**Memorable**: *"Own it when you can't trust the market"*

### 👥 People + Systems
