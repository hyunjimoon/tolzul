# history of thought
- two entities how to collaborate
- ecosystem is 
- third region 
	- purple integrate (spot transaction)
	- firm, policentric governance, market 
- coase was doing market vs firms
- alll the recent works (non-integrated governamce and integrated governance
- abscent in the datablue formal 
- colors 
	- blue = formal, 
	- green = 
	- red= political
	- gray=yellow (interpretative; cultural)
- authority (herbet simon - boss made decision; when buyer make the call)
- INTERACTION ARE GOVERNED? 
	- owing to the difficulty, contract is incomplete - comon language and conceptual 
- for today, we have purple, green, orange
	- will get to, blue, red, gray


# tranction cost economic
- fall of 2009
- accomplishments of TCE past and opportunities for TCE future (cost of integration, identification, internal org, formal model)
- TCE theories of vertical intregation, 
	- berkely willimson modeled hart's inishgt
	- west cambridge (harvard) willimson didn't have model


# adaptation model
- different from grossman ()
- let you analyze - relational adaptation

# property rights model

"the most consequential diff btw TCE (wmson)and GHM (=PRT) setups is that the former holds that maladaptation (MA🦖)in the context of the execution interval (EI🚦) is the principal source of inefficiency"

- show opposite in property model
- PRT don't have 🦖, 🚦 in MA and contract execution
- g,a,s,d, pi_i(a,s,d) 
- 🐢incentive, 🏠property rights, 👾adaptation(adaptaion is purple = integrate; alientable), rent-seeking
- control execution 
- 🐣biotech vs firm (repeated game - i and you have control and figure out expected value)
- merk and pfizer (grossmand, gibbon, hart, segal) 🎥4
- inalienable and noncontractable model (agent is gonna take actions)
- moral hazard a (add things like does worker own tool)
- ⭐️PRT has "contractable d"
	- parties will gonna bargain to efficiency given observed a,s - 
	- no g subscripts (control - who has control (g) doesn't affect the decision)
	- bargain our way to (coase thm; 1937 vs 1960(no transaction ; as long as ownership of property right))
- merk and is special case of PRT
- nash bargaining solution will produce $d^FB{a,s}$, compute the uniquie ans for you (what to do (d) and how to share the spoils (p - payment "check in your hand"))
	- bob's pal didn't like embedding in non-coorporate game
	- here'a conract (this decision if you give this much money - second mover - rejecting)
	- maximize game to extract
	- sol for two person game (shapley value, generalization of nash baragining; closed their model, any notion of baragaining is d being contractable)
	- ANY BARGAIN MODEL IS ASSUMING D IS CONTRACTABLE
- integration for weak incentives, non integration for hold-up
	- may choose firm's sluggish incentvie on purpose 
	- may choose holdup in  purpose ; incentive are well algined (small theta in multi task) - anticipating d creating alignment in a
	- high powered integration can be misdirected
- commitment (can't )
	- ukan: 
		- commuted from utah (assetless firms (rent space), )
		- GHM three players and two assets (one party) - take the third part (who do they work for but anyone; one of the two parties?)
		- winding up employees and 
- inefficiencies of non- (FIAT > HAGGLING; rent-seeking)


# rent seeking 

- achieved half chance of wininng with lowered cost 
ex ante, ex post


- cyert-march (1963) non ecnomic's take on power and 
- frank knight - propensity power in a firm is as worrisome as monopoly
- appropriable quazi rent
- after integration is far from efficient (combatance under non-integration; whole thing is inefficint; )
- **독재가 더 효율적이다** = 도둑이 한 명이면 경쟁 비용이 없다 **민주주의의 rent-seeking:** 여러 이익집단이 정부 혜택(보조금, 규제)을 놓고 경쟁; 로비, 소송, 관료 포섭에 자원 낭비; 파이 키우기보다 나눠먹기 싸움에 에너지 소진


# five 
- ex-ante: PRT, INF
- ex-post: APT, INF

- signal jam (action; public signal simga is noisy version of s; )
- agent can change the distribution of sigma
- in eq., agents will not be fooled
- milgraom and robers AJS 88
	- care what decision are taken, 
	- twist org (promotion ) away from production efficienty
	- influence cost model of org. pract and firm bounaries
		- organizational practice: how should it look like
		- firb boundaries 
		- decision making gets better but 
		- (put rule on those with - add buracracy; disempowered managers)
		- under this view, however, bruracay whithin firm is not a cost (on purpose; integration incentive to non-oweress; better shut that down)
		- ⭐️ decision making inside organizations is sluggish and bureaucratic on purpose, because integration leads to super strong influence incentives for the non owner better shut those down. ⭐️
		- Williamson: "통합하면 관료제가 불가피한 비용이다" (exogenous)
		- Powell: "아니, 관료제는 influence activities 막으려고 **의도적으로 설계**한 거다" (endogenous)
		- **⭐️ 조직이 느린 이유 = 내부 정치질을 원천 차단하기 위한 전략적 선택**
		- GHM endogene integration cost
		- maladaptation (MA🦖)in the context of the execution interval (EI🚦) is the principal source of inefficiency
