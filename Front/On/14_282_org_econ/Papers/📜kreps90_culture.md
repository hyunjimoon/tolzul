# Corporate Culture and Economic Theory (Kreps 1990)

## 🎯 핵심 주장
Corporate culture is an **equilibrium** of a **repeated game** played by organizational members. Culture solves the problem of **unforeseen contingencies** by providing shared understanding of "what we do here when X happens."

## 💡 Null Breaking
**They Said**: 
- **Economists**: Culture is "soft stuff," not analyzable
- **Sociologists**: Culture is norms/values, not rational

**Kreps Said**: Culture is **rational + strategic**. It's an equilibrium that:
1. Fills gaps left by incomplete contracts
2. Coordinates when situations are ambiguous
3. Is sustained by repeated-game logic (reputations)

**Surprise**: Culture = Equilibrium = Relational contract (all the same logic!)

## 🔑 Keep / Retire

### Keep ✅
- **Culture as equilibrium**: Formalized C&M routines
- **Unforeseen contingencies**: Culture's key function
- **Reputation sustains culture**: Repeated-game logic
- **Path dependence**: Early events shape which equilibrium
- **Parallels to Schein**: Basic assumptions = equilibrium beliefs

### Retire/Update ❌
- **Too static**: How do cultures evolve? (Gibbons: need building mechanisms)
- **Assumes clarity**: Shared understanding is HARD (Gibbons: clarity problem)
- **Individual focus**: Underplays coalitional dynamics

## 🧱 논증 블록

### Block 1: The Problem
Contracts are incomplete. Unforeseen contingencies arise. Organizations need to respond coherently.

### Block 2: Culture as Solution
**Culture** = "How we do things here" = **Equilibrium belief** about:
- What actions others will take
- How situations will be interpreted  
- What's considered appropriate

### Block 3: Sustained by Reputation
Why do people follow culture?
- **Short-term**: Might want to deviate
- **Long-term**: Reputation loss exceeds short-term gain
→ Culture is **self-enforcing** (like relational contracts)

### Block 4: Path Dependence
Early events (founders' actions, initial successes) → 
Create focal beliefs → 
Become equilibrium → 
Hard to change (switching costs)

## 🔗 Connections

### Builds On
- **Cyert & March (1963)**: Organizational routines
  - Kreps formalizes: Routines as equilibria
- **Schein (1985)**: Culture as "basic assumptions"
  - Kreps parallels: Assumptions = equilibrium beliefs
- **Repeated games**: Folk theorem logic

### Built Upon By
- **Van den Steen (2010)**: Culture as coordination device (different beliefs)
- **Gibbons-Henderson-Spagnolo (2021)**: Categorization shapes culture
- **Gibbons (2025)**: Building culture = building equilibria (clarity problem)

### Parallels
**Kreps' 3 aspects of culture** ≈ **Schein's 3 levels**:

| Kreps | Schein |
|-------|--------|
| Observable patterns | Artifacts |
| Espoused values | Espoused beliefs |
| Tacit assumptions | Basic assumptions |

**Key insight**: All three are **constitutive** (shape interpretation), not just **regulative** (constrain behavior)

## 🎓 Teaching Notes

### The Unforeseen Contingency Example
**Situation**: Customer angry about product defect

**No culture**: 
- Sales: "Not my problem" (protect bonus)
- Engineering: "Working as designed" (avoid blame)
- Result: Customer lost

**Strong culture** ("Customer first"):
- Sales: Immediately offers replacement
- Engineering: Investigates root cause
- Result: Customer retained, problem fixed

**How culture works**: Everyone knows "what we do here" without explicit contract

### Culture vs. Incentives
**Wrong view**: Culture = values → people act from goodness

**Kreps view**: Culture = equilibrium → people act strategically given **reputation concerns**

Example: Don't cheat customers because:
- **Not**: It's wrong (morality)
- **Is**: Others will notice, my reputation suffers, I lose future gains

### Connection to Gibbons
| Kreps (1990) | Gibbons (2025) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Culture = equilibrium | Equilibrium-building |
| Unforeseen contingencies | Clarity problem (categorization) |
| Path dependence | Building is slow, risky |
| Reputation sustains | Credibility problem solved |
| Assumes shared understanding | **Clarity problem unsolved** |

## 🔬 Research Implications

### Predictions
1. **Culture matters for unforeseen events**: Standard situations → formal contracts; novel situations → culture
2. **Path dependence**: Early events → lasting culture
3. **Culture change is hard**: Switching equilibria requires coordination
4. **Strong cultures → faster adaptation**: When everyone knows "what we do"

### Empirical Challenges
- **How to measure culture?**: Surveys? Observation? Text analysis?
- **Equilibrium selection**: Which culture emerges? (Gibbons: categorization problem)
- **Culture change**: Triggering events? Leadership? (Gibbons: building mechanisms)

### Modern Extensions
**Gibbons et al. (2021)**: 
- Culture shapes **categorization** of situations
- Categorization determines **visible equilibria**
- Small categorization differences → large culture differences

## 📊 Impact

### Academic
- **8,500+ citations**
- Legitimized culture study in economics
- Connected to relational contracts literature
- Foundation for behavioral strategy

### Practical
- Culture matters for **adaptability**, not just cohesion
- M&A: Cultural integration is equilibrium-switching
- Startups: Early culture choices have lasting effects

## 📝 Personal Notes

### Why This Matters for Gibbons

**Kreps (1990)**: Culture is equilibrium

**Missing**: HOW do parties build this equilibrium?

**Gibbons (2025) adds**:
1. **Naming** (Polanyi): Express tacit knowledge through stories, metaphors
2. **Framing** (GLW 2021): Categorization shapes which equilibria are visible
3. **Clarity problem**: Building shared understanding is HARD

### Kreps + Schein Synthesis
**Schein**: Culture = pattern of basic assumptions (learned by group)

**Kreps**: Culture = equilibrium (sustained by repeated game)

**Synthesis**: Culture is **constitutive equilibrium**:
- Shapes how people **interpret** situations (constitutive)
- Sustained by **reputation** (repeated game)
- **Path-dependent** on group's history (learned)

### The 3-Way Connection
```
Cyert & March (1963): Routines
         ↓
Kreps (1990): Routines = Equilibria
         ↓
Gibbons (2025): Equilibria = Relational Contracts
                = Culture
                = Shared Interpretations
```

**All face same challenge**: How to build shared understanding (clarity problem)

## 🎯 One-Sentence Summary
Corporate culture is an equilibrium of repeated interactions that fills contractual gaps by providing shared interpretations of unforeseen contingencies, sustained by reputation and path-dependent on organizational history.
