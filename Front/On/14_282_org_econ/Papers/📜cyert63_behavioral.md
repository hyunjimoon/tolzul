# A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (Cyert & March 1963)

## 🎯 핵심 주장
Firms are **political coalitions** with conflicting goals, not unified profit-maximizers. Decision-making follows **organizational routines** under bounded rationality. Goals emerge from **bargaining** among coalition members.

## 💡 Null Breaking
**They Said**: Neoclassical economics—firms maximize profits (single objective function).

**Cyert & March Said**: Firms are coalitions with **multiple, conflicting goals**. No single objective exists. Instead:
- Goals are **constraints** ("aspiration levels") not maxima
- Decisions follow **standard operating procedures**
- Search is **local and sequential**
- Learning is **adaptive**, not optimal

**Surprise**: Most management time spent on **internal coalition politics**, not external market optimization.

## 🔑 Keep / Retire

### Keep ✅
- **Coalitional view**: Organizations = political entities
- **Organizational routines**: SOPs guide behavior
- **Aspiration levels**: Goals as satisficing thresholds
- **Local search**: Look nearby first, expand if failing
- **Organizational slack**: Excess resources smooth conflicts
- **Attention allocation**: Who looks at what matters

### Retire/Update ❌
- **Too descriptive**: Lacks formal model (Gibbons: need game theory)
- **Underplays relational contracts**: Later work (Kreps, BGM) adds equilibrium logic
- **Static view**: How do routines change? (Nelson-Winter add evolution)

## 🧱 논증 블록

### Block 1: Firms as Coalitions
**Not**: Single decision-maker maximizing profit
**Is**: Coalition of groups (shareholders, managers, workers, customers, suppliers) with **different goals**

### Block 2: Goals as Aspiration Levels
Coalition members negotiate **constraints**:
- Shareholders: "At least 10% ROI"
- Workers: "At least $25/hour"
- Managers: "Market share above 15%"

Firm satisfices all constraints, not maximizes anything.

### Block 3: Organizational Routines
Decisions follow **SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures):
- Reduce cognitive load
- Enable coordination
- Embody organizational memory

**But**: Slow to change, can become dysfunctional

### Block 4: Search and Learning
When performance < aspiration → **Search**:
1. **Local first**: Nearby solutions
2. **Sequential**: One problem at a time
3. **Adaptive**: Learn from feedback

## 🔗 Connections

### Builds On
- **Barnard (1938)**: Organizations as cooperative systems
- **Simon (1947)**: Bounded rationality, satisficing
- **March (1962)**: Business firm as political coalition

### Built Upon By
- **Nelson & Winter (1982)**: Evolutionary theory—routines as "genes"
- **Kreps (1990)**: Corporate culture as equilibrium—formalizes routines
- **Gibbons (2025)**: Coalitional management + equilibrium-building

### Contrasts With
- **Neoclassical theory**: Single objective (profit max)
- **Agency theory**: Principal-agent conflicts (too narrow—many stakeholders)
- **GH (1986)**: Unitary actors bargaining (C&M: internal coalitions matter more)

## 🎓 Teaching Notes

### The Coalition Insight
Example: University
- **Neoclassical view**: University maximizes... what? Prestige? Research output?
- **C&M view**: Coalition of:
  - Faculty: Want research time, autonomy
  - Students: Want good teaching, credentials
  - Admin: Want smooth operations, budget balance
  - Alumni: Want reputation, traditions
  
→ President doesn't "optimize"; they **manage coalition conflicts**

### Organizational Slack
When resources abundant → slack accumulates:
- Excess staff
- Inefficient processes
- Comfortable routines

**Function**: Absorbs shocks, smooths conflicts

**Dysfunction**: Hides problems, resists change

### Connection to Gibbons
| Cyert & March (1963) | Gibbons (2025) |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Coalitional firm | Coalitional management |
| Routines | Equilibria (formalized routines) |
| Local search | Equilibrium-building is path-dependent |
| Aspiration levels | Participation constraints |

## 🔬 Research Implications

### Predictions
1. **Multiple goals**: Firms pursue various constraints simultaneously
2. **Sequential attention**: Problems solved one at a time
3. **Slack correlates with performance**: High performance → more slack
4. **Routine persistence**: SOPs change slowly (path dependence)
5. **Coalition shifts predict strategy changes**: Who has power matters

### Empirical Support
- **Greve (2003)**: Aspiration-performance gaps drive innovation
- **Bromiley (1991)**: Risk-taking increases below aspiration levels
- **Ocasio (1997)**: Attention structures shape decisions

### Modern Extensions
- **Behavioral strategy**: How biases shape firm decisions
- **Organizational ecology**: Routines as selection units
- **Gibbons et al. (2021)**: Categorization shapes equilibrium selection

## 📊 Impact

### Academic
- **42,000+ citations** (most-cited management book?)
- Founded **Carnegie School** tradition
- Precursor to **evolutionary economics** (Nelson-Winter)
- Influenced **behavioral strategy** field

### Practical
- Legitimized **stakeholder view** vs. shareholder primacy
- Explained why firms don't always "optimize"
- Management: Focus on coalition-building, not just strategy

## 📝 Personal Notes

### Why Gibbons Needs This
**Problem**: GH (1986) treats firms as unitary actors

**C&M Solution**: Firms are coalitions—internal politics matter as much as external contracts

**Gibbons Synthesis**: 
- Within firms: Coalition management (C&M)
- Between firms: Relational contracts (BGM)
- Both require: Equilibrium-building (Kreps, Gibbons)

### The Triple View
1. **Economics (GH)**: Property rights, residual control
2. **Behavioral (C&M)**: Coalitions, routines, bounded rationality
3. **Sociological (Kreps)**: Culture, equilibria, shared meaning

→ Gibbons integrates all three!

### C&M + Kreps (1990)
**C&M**: Organizations have routines

**Kreps**: Routines are **equilibria** of repeated games

**Synthesis**: Routines ≈ Relational contracts ≈ Culture
- All are equilibria
- All solve coordination problems
- All face **clarity problems** (shared understanding)

## 🎯 One-Sentence Summary
Firms are political coalitions pursuing multiple aspiration-level goals through organizational routines, under bounded rationality and sequential local search—not unitary profit-maximizers.
