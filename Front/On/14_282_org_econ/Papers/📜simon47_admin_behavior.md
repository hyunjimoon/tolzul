# Administrative Behavior (Simon 1947)

## üéØ ÌïµÏã¨ Ï£ºÏû•
**"The leader is only a bus driver; the passengers can get off."** Organizational decision-making is constrained by **bounded rationality**‚Äîlimited computational capacity, information, and time. Authority works through **acceptance of premises**, not obedience to commands.

## üí° Null Breaking
**They Said**: Rational choice theory‚Äîperfect information, unlimited computation, utility maximization.

**Simon Said**: Humans **satisfice** (seek "good enough"), not optimize. Organizations provide decision premises that members accept, creating **zones of acceptance** (extending Barnard).

**Surprise**: 
1. Bounded rationality ‚â† irrationality (it's rational given constraints)
2. Organizations succeed by **simplifying decision problems**, not solving complex ones

## üîë Keep / Retire

### Keep ‚úÖ
- **Bounded rationality**: Computational + informational limits
- **Satisficing**: Good enough > optimal
- **Decision premises**: Organizations provide frameworks for thinking
- **Authority = accepted premises**: Not commands but mental models
- **Attention as scarce resource**: Can't think about everything

### Retire/Update ‚ùå
- **Too cognitive**: Underplays politics and coalitions (March 1962 adds this)
- **Individual-focused**: Organizations are coalitions, not collections of individuals
- **No equilibrium concept**: Later work adds game theory

## üß± ÎÖºÏ¶ù Î∏îÎ°ù

### Block 1: Bounded Rationality
Humans face:
- Limited computational capacity
- Imperfect information  
- Cognitive constraints (memory, attention)

‚Üí Can't optimize; must satisfice

### Block 2: Organizational Decision-Making
Organizations help by:
1. **Simplifying**: Breaking complex problems into sub-problems
2. **Routinizing**: Standard operating procedures reduce cognitive load
3. **Specializing**: Divide attention across members

### Block 3: Authority as Acceptance
Leaders don't command outcomes; they provide **decision premises**:
- Goals to pursue
- Information to consider
- Procedures to follow

Members accept these premises ‚Üí enter "zone of acceptance" ‚Üí follow guidance

### Block 4: The Bus Driver Metaphor
Leader can steer (choose direction), but passengers can exit (refuse to follow). Effective leadership requires passengers to **stay on the bus**.

## üîó Connections

### Builds On
- **Barnard (1938)**: Authority = acceptance, zone of indifference
  - Simon extends: Acceptance of **decision premises**, not just orders
- **Classical decision theory**: Rational choice
  - Simon limits: Bounded rationality

### Built Upon By
- **March & Simon (1958)**: Organizations‚Äîexpanded with search, learning
- **Cyert & March (1963)**: Behavioral theory‚Äîadded political coalitions
- **Kahneman & Tversky (1970s+)**: Behavioral economics‚Äîheuristics and biases
- **Gibbons (2025)**: Bounded rationality + coalitions ‚Üí equilibrium-building challenge

### Parallel Traditions
- **Economics**: Incomplete contracts (Coase, Williamson)
- **Sociology**: Organizational ecology, institutional theory
- **Psychology**: Cognitive science, decision-making

## üéì Teaching Notes

### The Bus Driver Insight
Classic example: University president
- **Thinks they're**: Steering the bus (choosing university direction)
- **Actually**: Passengers (faculty) can exit (leave) if unhappy
- **Reality**: President provides decision premises faculty accept (or don't)

### Bounded Rationality ‚â† Stupidity
Students misunderstand this constantly!

**Not**: People are dumb
**Is**: Given constraints (time, info, computation), people are **adaptively** rational

Example: Chess
- **Unbounded**: Calculate all possible moves (impossible)
- **Bounded**: Use heuristics ("control center"), satisfice (good move > best move)

### Connection to Gibbons
| Simon (1947) | Gibbons (2025) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Decision premises | Shared interpretations |
| Zone of acceptance | Equilibrium participation |
| Bounded rationality | Clarity problem (categorization limits) |

## üî¨ Research Implications

### Predictions
1. **Organizations > individuals** at complex tasks (division of labor in thinking)
2. **Routines matter**: Reduce cognitive load, enable coordination
3. **Attention allocation** predicts organizational outcomes
4. **Decision premises** shape downstream choices (path dependence)

### Empirical Challenges
- Hard to measure "bounded rationality" directly
- Satisficing vs. optimizing: observationally equivalent?
- Decision premises: How to identify what people accept?

### Modern Extensions
- **Attention-based view** (Ocasio 1997)
- **Carnegie School** (March, Cyert): Routine search, political coalitions
- **Gibbons-Holden-Powell (2021)**: Categorization shapes visible equilibria

## üìä Impact

### Academic
- **35,000+ citations**
- **Nobel Prize 1978**: Founded "satisficing" economics
- Created **Carnegie School** tradition
- Foundation of **behavioral economics** (Kahneman, Thaler)

### Practical
- Influenced AI (satisficing algorithms)
- Management: Focus on decision processes, not just outcomes
- Policy: Recognize cognitive limits in regulation design

## üìù Personal Notes

### Why This Matters for 14.282

**Module 3: Delegation**
- Aghion-Tirole formal vs. real authority
- Simon: Real authority = whose premises are accepted

**Module 6: Culture**  
- Culture as **shared decision premises**
- Schein: "Assumptions" = Simon's "premises"
- Gibbons: Building culture = building shared interpretations

### The Triple Foundation
1. **Coase (1937)**: Incomplete contracts
2. **Barnard (1938)**: Authority = acceptance
3. **Simon (1947)**: Bounded rationality

‚Üí Together explain WHY visible hands matter:
- Contracts incomplete (Coase)
- Cooperation voluntary (Barnard)  
- Cognition limited (Simon)

### Simon + GH (1986)
GH: Ownership determines residual control rights
Simon: But control requires **acceptance**

‚Üí Property rights are necessary but not sufficient!

## üéØ One-Sentence Summary
Organizations help boundedly rational individuals make decisions by providing accepted premises, routines, and attention structures‚Äînot through commands but through frameworks for thinking.
