# The Nature of the Firm (Coase 1937)

## 🎯 핵심 주장
"Owing to the difficulty of forecasting, the longer the period of the contract, the less possible it is to specify what the other party is required to do" → Firms exist to coordinate when writing complete contracts is impossible.

## 💡 Null Breaking
**They Said**: Markets coordinate everything through price mechanism (invisible hand).

**Coase Said**: No—there's a second coordination mechanism: the entrepreneur's **conscious power** within firms. Coordination by direction, not price.

**Surprise**: Why does the price mechanism stop at firm boundaries? Because **transaction costs** make market coordination costly.

## 🔑 Keep / Retire

### Keep ✅
- **Incomplete contracts insight**: Contracts can't specify everything → need ongoing coordination
- **Transaction costs concept**: Coordinating through markets has costs
- **"Unprogrammed adaptations"**: Williamson's key takeaway

### Retire ❌
- **Firms vs Markets dichotomy**: Too binary, obscures hybrid forms (Gibbons 2025)
- **"Islands of conscious power" metaphor**: Ignores bridges between firms (Richardson 1972)
- **Entrepreneur as solo decision-maker**: Ignores coalitional nature (Barnard, Simon, March)

## 🧱 논증 블록 (논문 구조)

### Block 1: The Puzzle
"Why is coordination sometimes by price mechanism, sometimes by entrepreneur?"

### Block 2: Incomplete Contracts
When it's difficult to forecast and specify in advance → contracts become incomplete → need someone to decide later.

### Block 3: Transaction Costs
Discovering relevant prices, negotiating/concluding contracts, monitoring performance → all costly.

### Block 4: The Boundary
Firm expands until: (a) organizing mistakes cost = market transaction costs, or (b) diminishing returns to entrepreneurial function.

## 🔗 Connections

### Builds On
- **Knight (1921)**: Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit - uncertainty requires judgment
- **Robertson (1923)**: "Islands of conscious power in ocean of unconscious coordination"

### Built Upon By
- **Williamson (1975)**: Transaction Cost Economics - formalized Coasean insights
- **Grossman-Hart (1986)**: Property Rights Theory - first formal model
- **Baker-Gibbons-Murphy (2002)**: Integration serves relational contracts

### Critiqued By
- **Richardson (1972)**: "Firms are NOT islands" - directed coordination happens BETWEEN firms
- **Gibbons (2025)**: Retire dichotomy, keep incomplete contracts; reframe as "If contracts perfect, need bosses?"

## 📊 Impact & Citations
- **Google Scholar**: ~89,000 citations
- **Nobel Prize**: Part of Williamson's (2009) and Hart's (2016) prize justifications
- **Field Impact**: Launched organizational economics as distinct field

## 🎓 Teaching Notes

### Coase's 3 Key Moves
1. **Problem**: Why do firms exist? (vs. everything coordinated by markets)
2. **Answer**: Transaction costs + incomplete contracts → need conscious coordination
3. **Boundary**: Expand firm until cost of organizing = cost of market transaction

### What Coase Got Right (1937!)
- Contracts are incomplete
- Coordination has costs
- There's more than just "the market"

### What Coase Missed
- **Non-integration ≠ Market**: Alliances, networks, ecosystems
- **Conscious power ≠ Solo command**: Management is coalitional (Barnard, Simon)
- **Firms ≠ Islands**: Bridges everywhere (Richardson)

## 🔬 Research Implications

### Then (1937-2000)
Research agenda: "When should we integrate?" (Make vs. Buy)

### Now (2000+)
Research agenda: "How do visible hands coordinate?" (regardless of integration)
- Module 4: Integration decision
- Module 5: Non-integration governance
- Module 6: Building equilibria

## 📝 Personal Notes

### Gibbons' Verdict
> "Coase launched the field—celebrated for 88 years—but now it's time to retire the firm-market distinction **gracefully**, having honored its contribution."

### Modern Reframing
| Coase (1937) | Gibbons (2025) |
|--------------|----------------|
| "If markets perfect, need firms?" | "If contracts perfect, need bosses?" |
| Firm vs Market | Integration vs Non-integration |
| Entrepreneur's power | Visible hands (coalitional) |
| Price vs Direction | Invisible vs Visible hands |

### The One Sentence
**Coase**: Firms exist because market transaction costs sometimes exceed organizing costs.

**Incomplete**, because it ignores:
- Organized non-integration (Richardson)
- Coalitional management (Barnard, Simon)
- Equilibrium-building (Kreps, Gibbons)
