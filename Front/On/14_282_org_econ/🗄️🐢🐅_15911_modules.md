## Module 1: Foundations 👾

**Core Question**: What is the role of strategy in entrepreneurship? Should entrepreneurs just improvise?

### 起 (Introduction): Setting the Foundation

| **Session** | **Topic** | **Core Reading** | **Key Insight** | **Battlefield** |
|------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Class 1 | Foundations of E-Strat | EC&S Ch. 1, 4 | Strategic choice matters | 👾 Cognition |

**Critical Themes**:
- Strategy ≠ planning; strategy = choice under uncertainty
- Entrepreneurship requires balancing learning with commitment
- Key strategic choices define competitive advantage

**Connection to 思 (構造化)**:
- Frameworks provide structure for decisions
- Choice precedes action
- Strategic clarity enables execution

---

## Module 2: These Choices Matter 🐢

**Core Question**: What are the fundamental strategic choices facing startups?

### 承 (Development): Building Strategic Components

| **Session** | **Topic** | **Core Reading/Case** | **Key Insight** | **Battlefield** |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Class 2 | Choosing Customer | EC&S Ch. 5 | Customer segment choice drives strategy | 🐢 Innovation |
| Class 3 | **LYTRO** (Required HW) | Lytro case | Customer-technology mismatch | 🐢 Innovation |
| Class 4 | Choosing Technology | EC&S Ch. 6 | Technology choice under uncertainty | 🐢 Innovation |

```
Customer Choice ←→ Technology Choice
       ↓                    ↓
    Organization Choice
```

**Connection to OIL (Optimal Ignorance Level)**:
- τ* (precision) must match stage: early vagueness → later precision
- Customer choice determines acceptable ambiguity in technology
- Organization choice constrains experimentation capacity

#### Optional: Bayesian Entrepreneurship (Nov 26)

| **Reading** | **Author(s)** | **Key Insight** | **Connection to 思** |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Foundations of Bayesian E-ship | Agrawal et al | Optimistic priors drive contrarian choices | Precision-aspiration framework |
| Homo Entrepreneuricus | Gambardella, Gius, Stern | Learning with contrarian beliefs | Beta(α,β) → τ and μ |

**Critical Themes for 思's Research**:
- **Contrarian beliefs** = high μ (aspiration), moderate τ (precision)
- **Optimal ignorance**: τ* = max{0, √(V/4i) - 1}
- **Learning traps**: excessive precision prevents adaptation
- **Promise theory**: vague promises preserve optionality

## Connection to PhD Research

### Mapping 15.911 → Your Qualifying Exam

| **15.911 Concept** | **Your Framework** | **Mathematical Link** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| E-Strategy Compass | Promise types | μ (aspiration level) |
| Customer/Tech choice | Promise precision | τ (precision parameter) |
| Testing strategy | Learning process | Bayesian updating of Beta(α,β) |
| Scaling challenges | Learning traps | High τ → low adaptation |
| Lean methodology | Optimal ignorance | τ* = max{0, √(V/4i) - 1} |

### Your H1 and H2 in 15.911 Context

**H1: Vague promises → lower early funding (α₁ < 0)**
- Maps to M2 (Customer choice): Initial vagueness preserves optionality
- Maps to M4 (Strategy choice): Different strategies need different τ
- Example: Lytro's precise promise ("light field camera") limited customer scope

**H2: Vague promises → higher later success (β₁ > 0)**
- Maps to M5 (Scaling): Successful ventures increase τ over time
- Maps to Optional session: Contrarian beliefs need initial low τ
- Example: Tesla's vague early promise ("sustainable transport") → specific execution

### Consulting Assignment Strategy
Use 15.911 consulting project to:
1. Test your OIL framework on real MIT startup
2. Measure promise precision from company descriptions
3. Recommend optimal τ* given stage and sector
4. Provide to Charlie/Scott as validation of your theory

1. **Theoretical**: How does the E-Strategy Compass map to optimal τ* across archetypes?
2. **Empirical**: Can we measure promise precision from venture descriptions?
3. **Methodological**: Is there data on venture descriptions over time (for longitudinal τ analysis)?
4. **Applied**: Can consulting project startups serve as mini-cases for your thesis?

## 15.911 as 思 (構造化) Practice

This course embodies your role as 思 - the structurer:
- **ChatGPT gives you**: Raw case analyses, quick insights
- **You provide**: Theoretical grounding, EC&S framework application
- **Gemini validates**: Logical consistency, empirical accuracy

**Your meta-goal**: Don't just take the class — use it to refine your theory of promise precision

Every case is a data point for your (μ, τ) framework:
- Lytro: τ too high too early
- RapidSOS: Navigating μ shift (emergency → enterprise)
- Taxie: Learning updates both μ and τ
- Ministry of Supply: Low τ entry → high τ scale
- Jane Technologies: Platform τ (governance rules)

**필사즉생 (必死卽生)**: The deadline pressure is real, but structure conquers chaos
