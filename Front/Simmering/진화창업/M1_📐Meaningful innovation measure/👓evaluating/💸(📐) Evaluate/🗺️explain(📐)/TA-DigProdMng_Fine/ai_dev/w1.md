- deep learning doesn't perform well for time series, so data sharing on 
problems where rule-based solution will do the trick, complex problems requiring more context than data available, incomplete or poor-quality data, 
- dall-e is being sued by using image for training and affecting business model (copyright infringement)
- LLM are great for ideate, research, write, re-write, simulation, but analysis (where no symbolic notion exist) is poor

- nat.dev ($5)'s compare option; allows comparison among only set candidate (can't customize), but we can compare performance among open-ai model  in open-ai playground
- hugging face 
- whisper and otter offers transcript, llama2 (chat interface: hugging chat)
- open-ai api key and playground; model 
- benchmark (consulting); satisfaction for consulting (are you more satisfied with the result from gpt than llama)


traditional approach (choose strategy, customers, tech; ) - voiceflow (tool to say;) - difference between (nlp vs llm vs blended)
