| 📚 **Concept** | 💡 **Critical Insight** | 🔑 **Memorable Takeaway** | 🏆 **Application** |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Creative Destruction** | The opening of new markets leads to industrial mutation and revolutionizes economic structure | "Old destroyed, new created" | Disruption drives capitalism (Schumpeter, 2013) |
| **Basic Research (Nelson)** | Perfect competition doesn't allocate resources optimally for basic research | Profit ≠ social good | Public funding needed for basic research (Nelson, 1959) |
| **Industry Labs & Research** | Industry labs doing research is evidence for increasing basic research funding | "Spillovers boost society" | Increase spending for societal benefit (Nelson, 1959) |
| **Under-Investment in Invention** | Free enterprise under-invests in risky inventions with uncertain profits | "Risk > Reward" | Government role in funding inventions (Arrow, 1962) |
| **Wide-Ranging Payoffs** | Projects with wide applications shouldn’t rely on narrow justifications | "Think big, aim wide" | Broaden project goals to ensure value (Nelson, 1962) |
| **Absorptive Capacity & R&D** | Spillovers encourage firms to invest in R&D due to knowledge absorption | "Learn to gain" | Foster knowledge spillovers through R&D (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) |
| **Absorptive Capacity & Innovation** | Firms invest in basic research for future capacity to innovate | "Prepare today, win tomorrow" | Basic research preps firms for rapid response (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) |
| **Economics of Ideas** | Firms must price above marginal cost to incentivize innovation | "Profit powers innovation" | Allow pricing strategies that support R&D (Jones & Vollrath, 2013) |
| **Nonrivalrous Ideas** | Ideas have increasing returns to scale and benefit from a larger pool of researchers | "More researchers, more ideas" | Expand research teams to accelerate idea generation (Jones & Vollrath, 2013) |
