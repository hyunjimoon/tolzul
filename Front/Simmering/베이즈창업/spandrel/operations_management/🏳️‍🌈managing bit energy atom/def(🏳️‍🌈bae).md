## Double helix from clockspeed
- how to connect our manufacturing template's four adjustment times with clockspeed? lower sl adj time and higher inv adj time, less oscillation
	- supply: supply line, inventory, backlog
	- demand: perception 
![image](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/c314cee3-8004-41b5-858c-39ff2c66f0d4)
- from the figure, when does modules become commodities?, core rigidities?

- how is advanced manufacturing (use of innovative technology to improve products and/or processes, and may also include the use of new business/management methodologies) different from canonical manufacturing

## Dual pendulum : iterative diffusion of workflow 
spinoff of double helix with focus on workflow, by angie
- is the following reasonable?
1. x-axis: variability ratio of supply to demand (bio < chem < mech) valid?meaning in bio, demand is relatively known (cure disease, engineering cells) but supply is hard hence low var(demand)/var(supply). which is why pharma industry is slow clock speed. we know next to nothing about life engineering, but identified demand are high and certain.

2. y-axis: softness degree; bits only (1) vs bits+atoms vs bits+atoms+energy

## 1. a quote from [inmates running asylum](https://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140)

> I believe that we really are in a new economy. What's more, I think that the dot-coms never even participated in it. Instead, the dot-coms were the last gasp of the old economy: the economy of manufacturing.
> 
In the industrial age, before software, products were manufactured from solid material-from atoms. The money it took to mine, smelt, purchase, transport, heat, form, weld, paint, and transport dominated all other expenditures.
Accountants call these "variable costs" because that expense varies directly with each product built. "Fixed costs," as you might expect, don't vary directly and include things such as corporate administration and the initial cost of the factory.

> The classic rules of business management are rooted in the manufacturing traditions of the industrial age. Unfortunately, they have yet to address the new realities of the information age, in which products are no longer made from atoms but are mostly software, made only from the arrangements of bits. And bits dont follow the same economic rules that atoms do.
Some fundamental truths hold for both the old and the new economies. The goal of all business is to make a sustainable profit, and there is only one legal way to do so: Sell some goods or services for more money than it costs you to make of acquire them. It follows that there are two ways to increase your profitability.
Either reduce your costs or increase your revenues. In the old economy, reducing your costs worked best. In the new economy, increasing your revenue works much, much better.  today’s most vital and expensive products are made largely or completely of software. They consume no raw materials. They have no manufacturing cost. They have no transportation cost.


## 2. analysis from a [textbook Erin Scott recommended on econ strategy]( https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Strategy-7th-David-Dranove-ebook/dp/B01AKSZ952 ):

1. Economics of density
2. Purchasing
3. Advertising
4. Research and development
5. Physical properties of production
6. Inventories
The first four rely entirely or in part on spreading of fixed costs. Physical properties of production and inventory-based economies do not.

> Physical Properties of Production
Economies of scale may arise because of the physical properties of processing units. An important example of this is the cube-square rule, well-known to engineers. 6 It states that as the volume of the vessel (e.g., a tank or a pipe) increases by a given proportion (e.g., it doubles), the surface area increases by less than this proportion (e.g., it less than doubles).
The cube-square rule is not related to spreading of fixed costs. So what does the cube-square rule have to do with economies of scale? In many production processes, production capacity is proportional to the volume of the production vessel, whereas the total cost of producing at capacity is proportional to the surface area of the vessel. This implies that as capacity increases, the average cost of producing at capacity decreases because the ratio of surface area to volume decreases. More generally, the physical properties of production often allow firms to expand capacity without comparable increases in costs.
Oil pipelines are an excellent example of this phenomenon. The cost of transporting oil is an increasing function of the friction between the oil and the pipe. Because the friction increases as the pipe’s surface area increases, transportation costs are proportional to the pipe’s surface area. By contrast, the amount of oil that can be pumped through the pipe depends on its volume. Thus, the average cost of a pipeline declines as desired throughput increases. Other processes that exhibit scale economies owing to the cube-square rule or related properties include warehousing (the cost of making the warehouse is largely determined by its surface area) and brewing beer (the volume of the brewing tanks determines output).

I found attached paper from 15.357 reading list interesting as it explains hardware makes entrepreneur financially constrained (capital up-front), increasing the grant effect for hardware firms  (Table 7, column 3). However, there is no comparable effect on survival.
Also, "Emerging versus mature sector" is interesting as in [this](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/30194633/262426992-410000a2-1bfd-438c-8027-c505f88fa14d.png?jwt=*** diagram from #159, two axis of industry (env) were clockspeed and trend of industry.

how would the following change for hardware?
1. diagram (operation)
q1. does longer planning delay require less energy? depends on whether it's infinite order delay or smoothing (3rd degree) delay. if latter, the longer, the more energy as it need to keep track of past data.
q2. if q1 is yes, can we the problem as allocating resource to three tasks (release, planning, reengineering) across 100 weeks? e.g. release cycle is 4, planning delay is 2, reengineering delay is 1 (week) then the firm allocates its energy to each task as 1/7:2/7:4/7.

3. interpretation
2.1 release cycle lengths
2.2 planning delay
2.3 reengineering capacity

To answer resource allocation to bit and atom across a startup's growth phase, I decomposed them into three questions and made a table for each:
1. how does startup allocate resource between bits and atoms conditional on the environment (industry/market)'s atomness? #190 
2. how does startup sample and learn conditional on the environment? #191 
3. how does startup choose to change its environment? #192 

<img width="1056" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/4795e4bb-ba08-4cc5-9d1a-3819cf74b875">

## table1: bit and atom
Building on [Table1](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/190#discussion-6254456), I wish to understand resource allocation between startup's subcomponents **given the environment**. My hypothesis is industry's atomness affect startup operation greatly. Extending https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/147#discussioncomment-7022032 which compared how atom (physical) and bit ( digital) character affects startup operations in across lifecycle (development to end of life + entry barrier) I used analogical structure of DIGITAL:PHYSICAL = BIOTECH:SEMICONDUCTOR to flesh out the comparison. Moreover, framing these with biological analogies (cell, ecosystem, evolution, phylogeny, life) helped me understand startup biology and evolution. Dynamic feature in evolution helps us understand/formulate successful startup pivot by benchmarking across industry described in #100.

## table2: learn and grow
Building on [Table2](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/191#discussioncomment-8558622), I wish to understand how agent learn from environment and grow.

## table3: pivot
This investigates how a startup choose to **change its environment**. My hypothesis is, we can list conditions of successful pivot by combining Table1 and Table2. Moreover, we can answer, How is planned pivot (strategic) and improvised pivot differ? Where does Moderna's pivot which shifted from mRNA technology for therapy to vaccine development upon Covid lie on this spectrum? Could we understand successful and failed pivots in unified framework? 

Building on expative innovation discussed in https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/184#discussioncomment-8494869, we may need counterfactual (pivot vs non-pivot) which may be approached by modularized timeseries with e.g.  gaussian process (as in Birthday problem [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avehtari/casestudies/blob/master/Birthdays/birthdays.html) which can be represented as model network in sec.9.3 of [Multi-Model Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06329.pdf)). Using the analogy of sampling algorithm and startup learning during its growth, I built table2 which tries to use sampling algorithm's learning phase to give quantifiable (at least ordinal enough to turn causal loop into tree that identifies bottleneck) to current nail, scale, sail framework by Charlie.

### Comparison of Software vs. Hardware Startups

| Factor                                             | Software                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Hardware                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Experimentation Cost (c) & Value Inflection** | - **Low Cost (c↓):** Cloud computing allows for cheap, early experiments and "long-shot bets." <br><br>- **High Option Value:** Even with high failure rates, the low cost makes initial experiments valuable.<br><br>- **Clear Value Inflection:** Successful experiments can lead to massive step-ups in valuation. | - **High Cost (c↑):** Early experiments remain expensive, despite advances like 3D printing. <br><br>- **Noisy Signals:** Lab results are less predictive of commercial scalability. <br><br>- **Reduced Attractiveness:** Higher costs and lower predictive power make iterative testing less attractive to investors.                                                                    |
| **2. Pivoting Cost (k) & Irreversibility**         | - **Near-Zero Cost (k≈0):** Changes are modular. Code can be rewritten and features adjusted without scrapping physical assets. <br>- **Standard Procedure:** The "pivot" is a common and accepted strategy.                                                                                                          | - **High Cost (k≈1k \approx 1k≈1):** Decisions are "sticky" and create high irreversibility. <br><br>- **Sunk Costs:** Committing to a manufacturing process or architecture means changing it requires scrapping tooling, inventory, and re-doing certifications. <br><br>- **Investor Fear:** The high cost of failure makes it harder to finance strategies that might require a pivot. |
| **3. The Persuasion Gap (Value of Information)**   | - **Tolerance for Vagueness:** Investors accept some ambiguity because the next milestone (e.g., user traction) is a clear, objective signal of commercial viability.                                                                                                                                                 | - **Demand for Precision:** The definition of a "successful result" is often ambiguous due to a lack of established benchmarks. <br>- **Penalty for Vagueness:** Investors demand specific technical milestones to reduce ambiguity, penalizing founders who might prefer strategic flexibility.                                                                                           |

Based on Nanda (2024) and Gans et al. (2019), the difference between Software (SW) and Hardware (HW) isn't just about "code vs. atoms," but about the **economic structure of learning and commitment**.

제시해주신 **DPCDUDEE (Development, Production, Cost, Distribution, Updates, Data, End-of-Life, Entry)** 분류표는 하드웨어(HW)와 소프트웨어(SW)의 구조적 차이를 적나라하게 보여줍니다.

결론부터 말씀드리면, 이 표는 **실험 비용 ($c$)**과 **피벗 비용 ($k$)** **모두와 직접적인 관련**이 있습니다. 하지만 표의 항목별로 그 무게중심이 다릅니다.

### 1. 분석: 표의 항목은 $c$와 $k$ 중 어디에 해당하는가?

이 표는 **"SW는 가볍고($c \downarrow, k \downarrow$), HW는 무겁다($c \uparrow, k \uparrow$)"**는 것을 증명하는 증거 자료입니다.

- **실험 비용 ($c$, Experiment Cost)과 관련된 항목:**
    
    - **💻 Development:** SW는 코드만 짜면 되지만(Low $c$), HW는 원자재 소싱과 라인 구축이 필요합니다(High $c$). 초기 시제품을 만드는 비용 자체가 다릅니다. 1111
        
    - **🧐 Data Collection:** SW는 데이터 수집이 내재화되어 있어 반응을 즉시 보지만(Low $c$), HW는 연결되지 않은 제품의 데이터를 얻기 어렵습니다(High $c$). 즉, "신호를 얻는 비용"이 다릅니다.
        
- **피벗 비용 ($k$, Pivoting Cost / Irreversibility)과 관련된 항목:** (이 부분이 결정적입니다)
    
    - **🔧 Updates:** SW는 원격으로 몰래 고치면 되지만(Low $k$), HW는 리콜(Recall)이나 폐기를 해야 합니다(High $k$). **"고치는 비용"**의 차이입니다.
        
    - **⚙️ Production & 📊 Distribution:** SW는 서버비만 내면 되지만, HW는 재고(Inventory)와 물류(Logistics)가 묶입니다. 방향을 틀면 이 재고가 다 **매몰 비용(Sunk Cost)**이 됩니다(High $k$).
        
    - **🪦 End of Life:** SW는 서버 끄면 끝이지만, HW는 공장 폐쇄와 폐기물 처리를 해야 합니다. 들어가는 문보다 나가는 문이 좁습니다(High $k$).

### 2. 교통(Transportation) 분야 예시를 통한 쉬운 설명

이 차이를 **"내비게이션 앱(SW)"**과 **"전기차 제조(HW)"**의 창업자로 비교해 설명하겠습니다.

#### **(1) 실험 비용 ($c$): "첫 번째 시도의 가벼움"**

- **📱 내비게이션 앱 (SW):**
    
    - 창업자는 노트북 하나로 코드를 짜서 앱스토어에 올립니다. (Development)
        
    - 사용자가 버튼을 누르는지 안 누르는지 로그 데이터가 공짜로 들어옵니다. (Data Collection)
        
    - $\to$ **실험 비용($c$)이 매우 낮습니다.** 싸게 찔러볼 수 있습니다.
        
- **🚗 전기차 제조 (HW):**
    
    - 창업자는 금형을 파고, 배터리를 사오고, 공장 라인을 깔아야 시제품 한 대가 나옵니다. (Development)
        
    - 차가 도로에서 어떻게 달리는지 알려면 수천 km 주행 테스트를 직접 해야 합니다. (Data Collection)
        
    - $\to$ **실험 비용($c$)이 매우 높습니다.** 한 번 찔러보는데 억 소리가 납니다.
        

#### **(2) 피벗 비용 ($k$): "실수를 바로잡는 대가"**

- **📱 내비게이션 앱 (SW):**
    
    - "길안내 기능"이 별로라 "배달 기능"으로 바꾸려 합니다.
        
    - 그냥 코드를 업데이트해서 배포(Push)하면 끝입니다. 기존 사용자는 앱이 바뀐 줄도 모르게 넘어갑니다. (Updates)
        
    - 기존 코드는 지우면 그만입니다. (End of Life)
        
    - $\to$ **피벗 비용($k$)이 0에 가깝습니다.** 언제든 태세 전환이 가능합니다.
        
- **🚗 전기차 제조 (HW):**
    
    - "세단"을 만들었는데 안 팔려서 "트럭"으로 바꾸려 합니다.
        
    - 이미 찍어둔 세단 **재고 1,000대**는 고철이 됩니다. (Distribution/Inventory)
        
    - 세단용으로 만든 **금형과 로봇팔**은 트럭에 못 쓰니 다 버려야 합니다. (Production)
        
    - 이미 팔린 차에 결함이 발견되면 **전량 리콜**해야 합니다. (Updates)
        
    - $\to$ **피벗 비용($k$)이 1에 가깝습니다.** 한 번 방향을 정하면(Commit), 돌이키는 데 회사의 운명을 걸어야 합니다.
        

### 🎖️ 요약

장군, 이 표는 **하드웨어 창업자가 왜 그토록 신중해야 하는지(T2C1의 필요성)**, 그리고 **소프트웨어 창업자가 왜 그렇게 기민할 수 있는지(Just Do It)**를 **'비용 구조'**로 완벽하게 설명해줍니다.
- **SW:** $c$도 낮고 $k$도 낮음 $\to$ "일단 하고 고쳐라."
- **HW:** $c$도 높고 $k$도 높음 $\to$ "신중하게 실험(T2C1)하고, 한 번 정하면 목숨 걸고 밀어라." (그런데 투자자는 이 $c$를 안 주려고 하니 비극인 것입니다.)
