1. sync organization's prior on action, customer, product
- product: BayesSD_vensim with two main features: [automate aggregation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iFCK6h7Ocm3jK9hFGcaG8BCyDcwCO6Kr/edit#slide=id.p23), standardize prior elicitation (model structure, reference modes, dynamic hypotheses, CLDs, parameters sourced from SMEs, literature, other models, [default priors](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iFCK6h7Ocm3jK9hFGcaG8BCyDcwCO6Kr/edit#slide=id.p37))
- actions:  invest in $a_1$: infrastructure (bridge tools/standards/formats/apis), $a_2$: product feature, $a_3$: communicate with end users, document
- customer: heavy-modelers that supply model to policy makers 

for each action, repeat 2, 3
2. elicit and test hypotheses 
2.1 elicit one hypotheses for each sector
2.1.a atom_supply (produce, distribute, sell): Ha
2.1.b bit_supply (design, develop, launch): Hb
2.1.c customer_demand (customer side design, develop): Hc

2.2 test each hypotheses' criticality
2.2.a what is the most critical hypothesis to validate efficiency? -> Ha
2.2.b what is the most critical hypothesis to validate effectiveness? -> Hb
2.2.c what is the most critical hypothesis to validate satisfiability? -> Hc

2.3 sample size to validate hypotheses' criticality 
2.3.a plot marginal cost by sample size in validating Ha
2.3.b plot marginal cost by sample size in validating Hb
2.3.c  plot marginal cost by sample size in validating Hc

3. elicit and test (hypotheses, experiment) pair
3.1.a atom_supply (produce, distribute, sell): E1(Ha), E2(Ha)
3.1.b bit_supply (design, develop, launch): E1(Hb), E2(Hb)
3.1.c customer_demand (design, develop): E1(Hc), E2(Hc)

3.2 test each hypotheses' criticality
3.2.a what is the most faithful experiment to verify Ha? -> Ea(Ha(Na), Ma)
3.2.b what is the most faithful experiment to verify Hb? -> Eb(Hb(Nb), Mb)
3.2.c what is the most faithful experiment to verify Hc? -> Ec(Hc(Nc), Mc)

3.3 sample size to validate hypotheses' criticality 
3.3.a: plot marginal cost by sample size Ma in verifying Ha with Ea(Ma)
3.3.b: plot marginal cost by sample size Mb in verifying Hb with Eb(Mb)
3.3.c:  plot marginal cost by sample size Mc in verifying Hc with Ec(Mc)

4. choose action
compute cost for each action

Framing tomorrow's talk as customer's prior elicitation (i.e. customer interview) it would be helpful if we can use today's session for constructing a signal to action map via simulated data testing. 

# 1. sync organization's prior on action, customer, product
## actions
- $a_1$: improve infrastructure (bridge tools/standards/formats/apis)
- $a_2$: improve product
- $a_3$: communicate with end users, document

## customer
- heavy-modelers that supply model to policy makers 

## product
BayesSD_vensim` with two main features:
- [automate aggregation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iFCK6h7Ocm3jK9hFGcaG8BCyDcwCO6Kr/edit#slide=id.p23)
- standardize prior elicitation (Model structure, Reference modes,Dynamic hypotheses, CLDs, Parameters sourced from SMEs, literature, other models), [default priors](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iFCK6h7Ocm3jK9hFGcaG8BCyDcwCO6Kr/edit#slide=id.p37), 
`BayesSD_vensim` (hypothesis) - 20mins
- review [our sd talk slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iFCK6h7Ocm3jK9hFGcaG8BCyDcwCO6Kr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116598236953987431247&rtpof=true&sd=true) focusing on `BayesSD_vensim` @tomfid
- to design, develop, launch, produce, distribute, sell `BayesSD_vensim` product in the language of (evaluate, collaborate)|acculturate, (processify, replicate)|(automate, platformize)|capitalize 

Based on the synced prior of actions, customer, product, let's list critical hypothesis and their faithful experiments. These should be validated and verified. Plus lower opportunity cost experiments are desirable. Three main tradeoffs are ([details](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/159#discussioncomment-7149810)): 
1. Increasing N decreases ${ValidStatBiasCost(\phi, N)}$, but increases ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ 
2.  Increasing M decreases ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$, but increases ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ 
3. Less specified hypothesis $\phi$ on customer, technology, organization, competition may increase ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$, but generality of the test result may decrease  ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ 

N is sample size for validating criticality, M is sample size for verifying faithfulness and detail of `ValidStatBiasCost`, `VerifConvgBiasCost`, `VerifConvgBiasCost` are in Table in the last.

For each actions, we repeat testing hypothesis and experiments. Then we evaluate the actions that maximize utility.

e.g. on desiging state2signal system anticipating the noisiness
An agent has to decide between two actions a 1 and a 2 , uncertain of the prevailing state of nature s, which can be either s 1 or s 2 . The agent’s payoﬀ as a function of the action and the state of nature is as follows:

u(a 1 , s 1 ) = 10, u(a 1 , s 2 ) = 7

u(a 2 , s 1 ) = 5, u(a 2 , s 2 ) = 11

The prior probability of state s 1 is p = Pr(s 1 ).

a. Give a graphical representation of the agent’s decision problem as a function of the probability of state s 1 . If p = 0.4, what is the agent’s optimal decision?

b. Let the agent have access to a signal y before taking an action. Assume y has two possible outcomes with the following likelihoods:

Pr(y 1 | s 1 ) = λ 1 , Pr(y 1 | s 2 ) = λ2 

How valuable is this information system if λ 1 = λ 2 = 0.5? How valuable is it if λ 1 = 0.5 and λ 2 = 0?

c. Show that, irrespectively of the prior, the information system λ 1 = 0.5 and λ 2 = 0 is preferred to the information system λ 1 = 0.5α + 0.5 β and λ 2 = β , where α and β are any numbers between 0 and 1. (Hint: show that latter system is garbling of former.)
