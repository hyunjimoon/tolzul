“Don't ask for support. Inspire it.” -Russell, Madam Secretary

For nss_gps, I communicated with 
- bit (NSS's Charlie, Sergey and entrep. compass (EC)'s 'Scott, Erin for supply; Polly for develop; Polly's demo day and SD seminar for launch) 
- atom (Suyeol, Ryan for supply, Vikash for produce, Scott for distribute)
- customer (theory: nine professors from Bayes for business, practice: delta-v Bill and Daniella, Singapore innovation center) 
- demand (Jinhua, Singapore, other smart cities that would benchmark Singapore, innovation centers)

For all bit, atom, customer, demand, I used established infrastructure to blitz-nail. In June, I constructed the map of automation from 19th to 21th century,  merged 2by2 table by David Simchi-levi (push-pull, ?), Steve Eppinger (uncertainty in demand, supply), innovation literature (collaborate-compete, appropriability, excludability). In July, I concentrated on bridging NSS and EC, started connecting Erin and Scott. In August, I met Scott and identified his need for Bayes + approval of my idea. Pre-data test on my idea during bayes in business lunch meeting and followups was very helpful. Atom exponentiated on August as I  How to coordinate them to sync the loops of bit and atom, bit and customer
