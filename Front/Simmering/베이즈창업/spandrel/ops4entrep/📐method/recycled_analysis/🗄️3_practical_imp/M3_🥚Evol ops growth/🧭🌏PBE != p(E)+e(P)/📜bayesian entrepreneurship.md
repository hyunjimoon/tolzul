| Literature review | The literature on entrepreneurial decision-making reveals four critical gaps that our research addresses through a primal-dual optimization framework that models resource-rational entrepreneurial behavior. First, entrepreneurs lack a principled process to develop business models that transform implicit assumptions into calibrated mental models. While frameworks like the Business Model Canvas [@osterwalder2010] and Lean Startup [@ries2011] provide useful tools for articulating hypotheses, they offer little mathematical guidance for systematically updating these hypotheses through experimentation. As Afeyan, Murray, and Pisano note in the Bayesian Entrepreneurship foreword, entrepreneurship is "more about establishing hypotheses rather than having the right 'vision', and running the right experiments rather than writing one-hundred-page business plans" [@afeyan2023]. However, current approaches offer limited guidance on which experiments to prioritize when faced with multiple stakeholders and resource constraints, failing the efficiency criterion we establish for evaluating entrepreneurial decision algorithms.<br><br>Second, no robust process exists for persuading multiple stakeholders with divergent perspectives and operational variables. Existing ecosystem models and stakeholder theory [@adner2017, @freeman1984] recognize the importance of aligning diverse stakeholders but lack mathematical precision in coordinating stakeholder dynamics. As noted in the foreword, "The entrepreneurs' burden is not just to run the right experiment, and keep their minds open to updating, but also to convince others as well" [@afeyan2023]. This challenge requires algorithms that satisfy our axiom satisfiability criterion: different initial stakeholder states and different goals must lead to different action sequences. Our Primal-dual Resource-Integrated Strategy Model (PRISM) framework addresses this through a federated calibration approach for stakeholder alignment that quantifies and systematically reduces stakeholder-specific uncertainties.<br><br>Third and fourth, the field suffers from a false dichotomy between normative and positive approaches, and from the separation of Bayesian statistics from Bayesian cognition in business model development. Current research either prescribes ideal decision processes (resource rationality) [@lieder2020] or describes actual entrepreneur behavior (Type 2 rationality) [@kahneman2011], but rarely bridges these perspectives. Similarly, the statistical foundations of Bayesian analysis [@murphy2012] remain disconnected from cognitive models of how entrepreneurs actually update beliefs [@tenenbaum2011]. Our primal-dual formulation bridges these divides by connecting uncertainty minimization (the primal problem) directly to success likelihood maximization (the dual problem), creating a unified mathematical foundation that satisfies our third evaluation criterion: providing diagnostic tools through dual variables (λ, γ) and state transition matrices that give entrepreneurs actionable insights into their decision process. |

abstract: How does the fact that entrepreneurs choose the opportunity they pursue impact entrepreneurial strategy and performance? Entrepreneurs, while dealing with opportunities whose outcome is inherently uncertain, have choices that must be premised on a belief that the opportunity is worth pursuing. This insight provides an organizing principle for a Bayesian approach to entrepreneurial decision-making. A Bayesian approach offers a natural formal framework to assess how entrepreneurs form beliefs about the prospects for a given opportunity, how these beliefs evolve over time through active experimentation and learning, and the consequences of such beliefs for entrepreneurial strategy and performance. The goal is to shape distinctive implications and empirical approaches to the study of entrepreneurship guided by founding premises. The first premise is that the entrepreneur must be relatively optimistic about the opportunity relative to others. This involves a distinct theory that translates into a different perspective on the opportunity’s prospects. Second, this systematic divergence in beliefs impacts how an entrepreneur will undertake learning about an opportunity. Notably, the demand for “experiments” is fundamentally influenced by beliefs about the opportunity. For example, relative to a disinterested agent, a Bayesian entrepreneur will conduct experiments that are more likely to allow for “false positives” than “false negatives.” Finally, this approach promotes the processes by which entrepreneurs are able to attract resources and capabilities by providing information to other agents. Entrepreneurs are more likely to convince those who share their idiosyncratically optimistic beliefs about an opportunity (with implications for homophily and firm culture), yet will also engage in choosing experiments that cater to those with different (more negative) beliefs than they themselves hold.

- As in #🗄️example1/#🗄️example2, you can embed relevant figures (plots or diagrams) illustrating decision models (e.g., “low-bar” vs. “high-bar” experiments) or showing how priors and posteriors evolve. If none are finalized, simply note “None” or “TBD” in the last column.

Use (and modify) the above table as a concise roadmap for your manuscript. If you need further breakdowns (e.g., multiple subsections per row) or prefer the #🗄️example2 format with “Key Literature / Key Message / Technical Details,” simply adapt these headings to match your preference. Always feel free to ask for clarifications!
