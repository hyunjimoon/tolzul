#program

But the model can't run by itself. You need a way to realize your model into some computable form, a program. And as such, you need to use a probabilistic programming language such as Stan, that can perform inference for your model. Only then is reducing the aleatoric uncertainty possible.

Computation has completed and you know have more than enough confidene and certainty about the parameters. Does this mean you now understand the goods-generating process? The answer is "it depends". If the model you have devised, that links epistemic uncertainty to aleatoric uncertainty is reasonable enough and due to keen observations of reality was sufficient in containing some epistemic uncertainty, then the reduced aleatoric uncertainty will also contribute in reducing some epistemic uncertainty. However, the model being a bad analogy of the generating process means you only reduced aleatoric uncertainty irrelevant to the generating process.
