  
I felt ashamed this morning discovering my mail below wasn't sent. I sincerely apologize.

> I checked your office for mails as requested, and could not find any. There used to be a mailbox for TIES faculty in the location below, but it’s gone. Will ask around, check, then follow up. (Aug.26)

In September, I asked Kimberely and checked the group mailbox on the sixth floor, but couldn't find any.

Yesterday, I found two new mails (eric mail oct.png attached).

P.S. I can't be excused, but if I may add a brief context.. 

I failed my first qualification exam last May. Fortunately, my committee gave me a second chance to retake the exam so I'm focusing on 轉禍爲福, which means _change 轉 adversity 禍 by acting it 爲 into prosperity 福._

  
Although I designed failure by forming a committee with individuals holding incompatible theories but a similar contrarian spirit, it was still a painful summer trying to produce research that would be accepted by all four of them. Believe it or not, spending my whole summer in your office, calmed my fear.
