While prior entrepreneurship literature has explored various epistemological approaches to opportunity creation and exploitation, less attention has been paid to how entrepreneurs endogenously shape their venture's success probability through strategic choices. The effectual logic (Sarasvathy, 2001) emphasizes resource navigation but treats success as emergent from experimentation. The causal perspective (Kirzner, 1997; Shane, 2003) views opportunities as discoveries, with success depending on alertness and execution. The scientific approach (Camuffo et al., 2020) focuses on hypothesis testing under given uncertainty. The design perspective (Berglund et al., 2020; Dimov, 2021) comes closest to our view in seeing entrepreneurship as artificial construction, yet stops short of formalizing how promise architecture determines success probability. Similarly, while operations research has examined survival strategies for resource-constrained firms (Archibald et al., 2002), this work treats survival probability as arising from operational decisions within exogenous market conditions. Our contribution bridges this gap by showing how entrepreneurs transform success from an exogenous parameter determined by market forces into an endogenous variable shaped through promise design. We formalize the PRHC (Parameterize-Regularize-Hierarchize-Calibrate) framework, demonstrating that entrepreneurs don't merely navigate given games or discover existing opportunitiesâ€”they architect the games themselves through calibrated promises that determine both stakeholder buy-in and operational feasibility.
