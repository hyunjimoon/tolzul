# Bayesian Evolution Literature Classification (Nanda & Lo Perspective)
## Based on 🗣️bayes_evol Framework - Finance/Risk Lens

### Core Framework Applied Through Finance
- **Double Reparameterization**: Success probability → Promise level (φ) → Aspiration (μ,τ)
- **Risk-Return Trade-off**: How promise level φ affects funding probability
- **Information Asymmetry**: Gap between founder's τ and investor's perception
- **Portfolio Theory**: Diversification across different (n,τ) coordinates

|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **[[2세련지/📜paper/🐙/해식량/📜🐙_yoo21_theorize(lean, operations)]]** | Build-test-learn reduces information asymmetry | Each iteration provides signals updating investor beliefs | - | Cost of capital changes as learning progresses |
| **[[2세련지/📜paper/🐙/해식량/📜🐙_corbett07_observe(entrepreneurs, newsvendor-behavior)]]** | Risk-seeking in loss domain explains unfavorable term acceptance | Prospect theory explains "irrational" financing decisions | - | High τ when facing bankruptcy, low τ when flush |
| **[[📜🐙_Alvarez_Porac20_imagination_indetermincy_managerial_choice)]]** | Fundamental uncertainty needs new financial instruments | Convertible notes, SAFEs emerge as uncertainty responses | - | Instruments allow varying τ over time as uncertainty resolves |
| **[[2세련지/📜paper/🐙/해식량/📜🐙_phanchambers18_integrate(entrepreneurship, operations)]]** | Unknown unknowns as purely exogenous | - | Markets price even "unknown unknowns" through volatility premiums | Founders actively manage τ to optimize cost of capital |
| **[[📜🐙_sterman00_model(business, dynamics)]]** | Deterministic feedback loops | - | Can't capture discrete financing events, needs stochastic shocks | Models must incorporate funding rounds, not continuous flows |
| **[[📜🐙_terwiesch09_design(innovation, tournaments)]]** | Tournament model for innovation | - | Ignores winner's curse and adverse selection | τ parameter captures self-selection into competitions |
| **[[📜🐙_packard17_observe(opportunities, beliefs)]]** | Transform unmeasurable uncertainty | Staging investments allows sequential revelation | - | Each funding round recalibrates both n and τ |
| **[[📜🐙_yarkoni24_integrate(explanation, prediction)]]** | Explanation vs Prediction framework | Diversify across explanation-strong and prediction-strong ventures | - | High τ ventures need different risk metrics than high n |

## 🐅 Prairie Food (초원식량) Literature - Finance Perspective

| Paper | Core Concept | 🟢 AGREE | 🔴 DISAGREE | 💰 Finance Application |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **[[📜🐅_kerr14_systematize(experimentation, entrepreneurship)]]** | Entrepreneurship = experimentation with unknowable probabilities | **Strongly agree**: Captures venture uncertainty perfectly | - | Each funding round = experiment with capital at risk |
| **[[📜🐅_granovetter78_model(collective-behavior, thresholds)]]** | Individual thresholds → collective outcomes | Threshold models explain herding behavior | Too deterministic for volatile markets | Explains funding cascades and market crashes |
| **[[📜👾_bolton24_moral_hazard]]** | Entrepreneurs design uninformative experiments | **Perfect fit**: Explains adverse selection in funding | - | High τ = manipulating investor signals strategically |
| **[[📜🐅_loch02_optimize(portfolio, selection)]]** | Marginal analysis for portfolio optimization | Portfolio thinking essential for VCs | Misses active uncertainty management by founders | VCs must optimize across (n,τ) space |
| **[[📜🐅_kavadias03_sequence(projects, optimization)]]** | cμ rule for project sequencing | Sequencing matters for capital efficiency | Too rigid, assumes fixed parameters | Founders manipulate perceived urgency via φ |
| **[[📜🐅_dada07_diversify(sourcing, suppliers)]]** | Diversification for risk management | Standard portfolio theory applies | Sometimes concentration optimal | High τ justified when C > diversification benefit |
| **[[📜hume_an_enquiry_concerning_human_understanding]]** | No necessary causation, instinct over reason | Philosophical foundation for market uncertainty | - | Justifies why markets price "unknown unknowns" |

## Nanda-Lo Specific Financial Mechanisms

### Capital Market Dynamics by Stage

| Stage | Optimal τ | Optimal n | Investor Type | Key Trade-off |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Seed** | High | High | Angels | Protect idea vs attract capital |
| **Series A** | Medium | Medium | Early VCs | Signal quality vs maintain flexibility |
| **Growth** | Low | Low | Late VCs | Transparency vs competitive advantage |
| **IPO** | τ→0 | Low | Public markets | Full disclosure requirement |

### Financial Interpretation of Model Parameters

| Parameter | Financial Meaning | Market Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **φ (promise level)** | Implicit valuation claim | Term sheets, pitch decks | "We'll be a $1B company" |
| **τ (concentration)** | Information disclosure strategy | Due diligence resistance | Refusing certain data requests |
| **n (complexity)** | Systematic/market risk | Beta, volatility measures | Industry-specific challenges |
| **C (digestion cost)** | Due diligence expense | Legal, accounting fees | $500K Series A legal costs |
| **Learning trap (τ→∞)** | Liquidation preference overhang | Down rounds, washouts | WeWork's valuation collapse |

### Portfolio Construction Strategies

| Strategy | (n,τ) Coordinates | Expected Return | Risk Profile | Example Fund |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Spray & Pray** | High n, Low τ | Low | Diversified | 500 Startups |
| **Conviction Bets** | Low n, High τ | High | Concentrated | Founders Fund |
| **Index Approach** | Medium n, τ→0 | Market | Systematic only | AngelList Syndicates |
| **Smart Money** | Variable n, Optimal τ* | Superior | Actively managed | Sequoia Capital |

## Key Financial Insights

1. **Information Asymmetry**: τ directly measures degree of strategic information withholding
2. **Staging Logic**: Each round recalibrates both n and τ based on revealed information
3. **Valuation Premium**: High τ commands premium from sophisticated investors, discount from others
4. **Exit Strategy**: IPO requires τ→0 (full transparency); M&A allows maintaining some τ
5. **Market Cycles**: Bull markets reduce C → encourage τ→0; Bear markets increase C → justify higher τ
6. **Adverse Selection**: Bolton's uninformative experiments = our high τ manipulation

### Unique Finance Contribution
- **Capital Structure as τ Choice**: Debt (low τ) vs Equity (high τ) vs Convertibles (adaptive τ)
- **Due Diligence as C**: Explains why some deals close quickly (low C) vs drag on (high C)
- **Down Rounds as Learning Traps**: When τ was too high relative to actual performance
- **SAFE Notes**: Institutional innovation allowing τ flexibility before pricing

## 🌙 Financial Reframing Style
Your model gains power through financial lens:
- Promise level φ becomes implicit valuation claim
- Digestion cost C becomes transaction costs
- Learning trap becomes preference stack problems
- τ optimization becomes disclosure strategy
