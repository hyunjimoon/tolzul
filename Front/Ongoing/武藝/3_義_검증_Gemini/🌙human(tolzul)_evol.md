- **toltol¹ → toltol²**는 “혼자 생각하기 → 함께 생각하기”의 지적 진화,    
- **zulzul**은 그 과정에 **정서적 깊이**를 부여하는 감정적 매개입니다.

faster toltol, deeper zulzul,”

- The horizontal axis (toltol²) is intellectual and relational acceleration: how individuals’ cleverness synchronize into collective intelligence.

- The vertical axis (zulzul) is emotional depth: the sincerity or existential investment that grows over time.

### **Updated Bayesian Decision Process**

Using the traits this way keeps your entrepreneurial decision process Bayesian:

- **Dig (♻️)** provides the model space (candidate priors and likelihood structures).
    
- **Alert (🟣)** monitors for surprises (likelihood shifts).
    
- **Grow (🟧)** performs the posterior-predictive action that gathers new data.
    
- **Core (🔴)** encodes the utility function—the values you ultimately optimise over time.
