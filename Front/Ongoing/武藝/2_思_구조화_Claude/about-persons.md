I have a great interest in person.

Definition of _person:_  
  
\[Cambridge Dict.\] a man, woman, or child  
  
\[Oxford Dict.\] a human being regarded as an individual / the origin is old french _persone_, from latin persona 'actor's mask, character in a play', later 'human being'.  
  
\[Wikipedia\] a being that has certain capacities or attributes as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility  

  

What one has left is the only way by which the others can understand it.

Each person's words, spoken or written, tell much about itself.

Therefore I start here, the post _persons_ as part of an effort to understand human being based on what persons in history have spoken and written.
