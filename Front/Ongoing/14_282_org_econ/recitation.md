## steady state predictions

firm dynamics
steady state for a mass

performance differences (some firms are more profitable than others)
di

managerial practice aren't easy to observe but (org capital improves,) -> management has causal impact on profitability

leaders and individuals matter (x=1 vs 0); manager is at the center of the model

in terms of modeling (mechanical; how you write apply paper, not relevant with the real words)

- no surprising (luck in )
- solve for (single agent model stacked together) -> incorporate strategic 
- useful for empirical; unify lots of theoretical works
- broad knowledge of literature

intuitive game theory

building routines: learning, cooperation, 

## chassang (2010)
- exploration and exploitation phase
- value of collaboration grows and parties build a common understanding of their environment

### simplified
- symmetric information
- principal and agent interact repeatedly
	- choose routine (d=0) or experiment (d=1)
	- if d=1: agent chooses private effort e in 0 or 1
	- p is probability of improving sate (pde)
- rule out money btw employer and employee 
- Levin, nothing interesting happens on path
- only exert effort if the agent thinks gurantee is better
- firing must happen on path
- if you tell her you'll never fire her, then she'll never work hard
- fire or not given agent's past is computationally hard
- IF FIRING HAPPENS, IT SHOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY
- effort is not observable (only know whether probability is high or not - tradeoff ; cost of doing vs ) - 
- ⭐️trying to build equilirium where agent will exert effort⭐️ ()
- even ; cost of having to fire a hard working person - 
- the higher value of relation (AS THE COMPANY MATURES), the less incentive you have to experiment (Chassang) VS tomorrow paper: the opposite
- persistence to performance difference (PPD)
- if you have money, you'd never fire agent -> loose the intuition
- 💰do i put money(so powerful; model become stationary) or not in the money (no firing) ->  DON'T HAVE STH IN BETWEEN (wealth constraints)
- if R_t = b, not to experiment,

- implementability of experimentation policies

sum across domain, 
because of the inequality, there will be interdependancy,

breakthrough in domain 1, our relation; pool incentive accros domain, 
no loss in pooling from every domain (defect, punish in every domain)
project never expire, 

average of the project should be sufficiently higher (deteriorate; )

explore until we find "v not", don't know what you don't know - become confident,

- exploitation phase is harder to sustain as outcome if fixed (clear winner and loser)  WHEREAS exploration phase people all have they will be the winner
- you can't characterize it 
- what i can do today -> what i can do tmr

charlie - just as you want me to be happy, i want you to be happy, and that was motivation behind trying to add operational piece

i wish to have
