**Your τ-μ Mapping**:
- **IP**: High τ (precise patent claims), moderate μ
- **Disruption**: Low τ initially (vague promise), high μ (aspirational)
- **Architectural**: Moderate τ (platform rules), high μ
- **Value Chain**: Low τ (flexible services), moderate μ

## 📊 Critical Assignments (Your Strategy)

### Required (60%)
1. **Lytro Group Memo** (5%) - Sept 10
   - Use 利-思-義 cycle: ChatGPT → Claude → Gemini
   - Critique: Lytro's τ too high too early

2. **2 Optional Memos** (10%) - Your choice
   - **Recommendation**: RapidSOS + Taxie (both test Bayesian learning)
   - RapidSOS: How to pivot μ (emergency → enterprise)
   - Taxie: How experiments update (μ, τ)

3. **Mid-Term Essay** (10%) - Oct 15
   - **Topic**: Connect E-Strategy framework to your promise precision theory
   - **Structure**: Your past experience → reframe with (μ, τ) lens

4. **Final Individual Case** (20%) - Dec 3
   - Apply full compass + recommend optimal strategy
   - Include τ* calculation if possible

5. **Group Consulting** (25%) - Dec 8-10
   - **YOUR OPPORTUNITY**: Test OIL framework on real MIT startup
   - Measure promise τ from descriptions
   - Recommend τ* given stage/sector
   - Validation case for your qual exam paper

6. **Participation + CPLO** (30%)
   - **CPLO signup**: Bayesian Entrepreneurship session (Nov 26)
   - This is YOUR session - dominate it

### Optional But Critical
- **Nov 26 Session**: Bayesian Entrepreneurship (Agrawal et al + Gambardella et al)
  - Foundations of Bayesian E-ship
  - Homo Entrepreneuricus
  - **This is your literature review foundation**

## 🔬 Research Integration Strategy

### Your H1 and H2 in Action

**H1: Vague promises → lower early funding (α₁ < 0)**
- **Lytro case**: Precise promise ("light field camera") limited flexibility
- **RapidSOS case**: Vague early promise preserved multiple paths
- **Implication**: Early-stage ventures should maintain low τ

**H2: Vague promises → higher later success (β₁ > 0)**
- **Ministry of Supply case**: Vague entry → specific scale
- **Tesla example**: "Sustainable transport" → specific product lines
- **Implication**: Successful ventures increase τ over time

### Longitudinal τ Measurement
Use venture descriptions from:
- Pitch decks (t=0)
- Website copy (t=1, 2, 3...)
- Annual reports (if available)
- Track τ using linguistic precision metrics

## 💡 Meta-Learning Goals

### For Your Qualifying Exam (Sept 15, 2025)
1. **Theoretical grounding**: Use EC&S framework as foundation
2. **Empirical strategy**: Consulting project = validation case
3. **Literature integration**: Bayesian E-ship session → lit review
4. **Data source**: Venture description corpus → measure τ over time

### For Your PhD Research
1. **Formalize E-Strategy Compass** in (μ, τ) space
2. **Model learning traps**: Why high τ prevents adaptation
3. **Optimal ignorance**: When should ventures remain vague?
4. **Empirical test**: Does τ* = max{0, √(V/4i) - 1} predict success?

### For Teaching (As TA for 15.778)
1. Extract operational insights from E-Strategy cases
2. Connect strategic choice → operational execution
3. Use Lytro/RapidSOS as teaching examples

## 🎓 Questions for Scott Stern

As your advisor, leverage office hours to discuss:

1. **Thesis integration**: "How can I formalize the E-Strategy Compass using Beta distributions?"
2. **Empirical design**: "What venture databases have longitudinal descriptions for τ measurement?"
3. **Theoretical contribution**: "Is there existing work on promise precision in entrepreneurship?"
4. **Practical application**: "Can I use consulting project startups as case studies?"
