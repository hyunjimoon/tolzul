## **Research Statement**

My research focuses on the development and estimation of empirical models of consumer and firm behavior. In the context of marketing, the goal of empirical modeling is to construct mathematical/statistical representations of a process of interest (e.g., consumer choice, sales generation, etc.) and to estimate the parameters of the same using either marketplace or experimental data. These models, in turn, can be used for a variety of purposes, including predicting behavior, testing theory, and forecasting market performance. Although the contextual applications of my research are diverse, the unifying theme to my work is the development and application of Bayesian statistical methods to marketing and management problems.

To date, I have published 7 papers in A-level journals (2 in *Marketing Science*, 2 in the *Strategic Management Journal*, 1 in the *Journal of Marketing Research*, 1 in the *Journal* *of Marketing*, and 1 in *Quantitative Marketing and Economics*), as well as a variety of other papers in well-respected, peer-reviewed outlets. I currently have many projects in various stages of development that are being prepared for submission or are under review at high-quality journals.

The following is a discussion of two of the key areas of my research program.

### *Endogeneity and Simultaneity*

Endogeneity is a problem that plagues models that are estimated using observational data (e.g., promotional response or marketing mix models). In the context of marketing decisions, endogeneity occurs most often when the inputs into a process are selected with an expectation of how they will influence the resulting output. For example, when studying the relationship between price (x) and sales (y), price is endogenous to the system of study if it is set by management in order to maximize its corresponding impact on sales, revenue, or profitability. Endogeneity invalidates the use of standard estimation methods (i.e., the estimated parameters will be both biased and inconsistent) and ultimately leads to a misunderstanding of the true, causal relationship between x and y.

In my paper, “Investigating the Strategic Influence of Customer and Employee Satisfaction on Firm Financial Performance,” we develop an approach to handling endogeneity that involves modeling both the generation of sales, y, and the selection of the inputs into the process, x. We show that application of this method allows us to recover the true, causal relationship between x and y. As a byproduct of the structure of the model, we are able to make inference about the efficiency of firm utilization of resources. These results allow us to guide firms in terms of optimally allocating resources across different marketing activities.

This approach to dealing with endogeneity is extended in 3 of my other published papers, \`\`A Structural Approach to Handling Endogeneity in Strategic Management,'' \`\`Corporate Diversification and the Value of Individual Firms,'' and \`\`Principles or Templates? The Antecedents and Performance Effects of Cross-Border Knowledge Transfer.'' The first paper is directed to a management strategy audience and attempts to resolve a long-standing debate in the empirical strategy literature regarding the impact of resources on firm performance (as defined by the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm). We show that current approaches used to study the relationship between resources and firm performance confound the efficacy of the resource and the firm’s ability to optimally utilize the same. By applying the methods discussed above, we can recover the true relationship between resource and performance, thus providing us with a legitimate test of the RBV. The second and third papers apply similar techniques to study a variety of substantive questions.

Simultaneity, or joint causation, is another form of endogeneity that I have addressed in my research. In “Non-normal Simultaneous Regression Models for Customer Linkage Analysis” we develop a method that allows us to separate causal effects in a simultaneous system of equations. This work is applied in the context of retail banking where we examine the relationship between customer and employee satisfaction. We allow for joint causality in the customer-employee relationship and show that, contrary to the existing literature, customer satisfaction is a stronger driver of employee satisfaction than the reverse.

*Discrete Choice Modeling (Conjoint Analysis)*

Discrete choice modeling techniques and, more specifically, conjoint analysis are staples of the marketing research community. Conjoint analysis is an experimental, decompositional approach to studying consumer preference. In a conjoint study, subjects complete a survey where they are asked to respond to (e.g., rate or choose from) a variety of hypothetical product bundles. Conjoint analysis forces respondents to make trade-offs in terms of their preference for specific aspects of the product (e.g., do I want a fast processor or a lower price). This experimental data and corresponding estimation strategies allow us to determine the total value of a product (i.e., utility) for a particular individual in terms of their value for the product's constituent parts (i.e., attributes). In practice, conjoint analysis is used for a variety of purposes, including new product development, product positioning, and price optimization.

I have published one paper in this area and currently have 5 working papers and several new projects in this area. My first published paper in this research stream, \`\`A Probit Model Structured Covariance for Similarity Effects and Source of Volume Calculations,'' attempts to resolve a long-standing issue in conjoint analysis: the impact of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property of the Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) on cross-brand substitution patterns. A limitation of the IIA property is that substitution patterns are governed by the modeling assumptions (i.e., assumptions about the error distribution) and not by the composition of products in the market. In our paper we relax these distributional assumptions by building a Probit model with a structured covariance matrix, where structure is imposed as a function of the perceived similarity of the alternatives in a choice set. Our model allows for realistic substitution patterns that are governed by product similarity and not distributional assumptions. This paper was published in 2018 in the *Journal of Marketing Research*.

In a related paper, “Brands, Images, and Other Complex Attributes in Conjoint Analysis,” we extend the Structured Covariance Probit model in order to allow us to incorporate highly subjective attributes like image, taste, sound, and smell into the conjoint. Specifically, we develop an approach to control for the visual design of automobiles (i.e., shape) when making market share forecasts and assessing cannibalization rates and substitution patterns. This paper is currently in the review process at the *Journal of Marketing Research*.

*Future Research Plans*

In the coming years I intend to continue to pursue the research agenda discussed above by integrating new innovations in computation and data sources. In particular, I am currently pursuing multiple projects that incorporate the new class of generative artificial intelligence tools in the context of discrete choice experimentation. For example, one of my working papers, “Generative AI and Artists: Consumer Preferences for Style and Fair Compensation,” explores the impact of invoking a specific artist’s style in a text-to-image generator (e.g., MidJourney, Stable Diffusion) on consumer preference and willingness-to-pay. This is accomplished (in part) by developing a discrete choice experiment where the stimuli are created using generative AI, thus allowing us to isolate the effect of artistic style on preference and choice. A related paper, “Creating Experimental Stimuli with Generative AI,” formalizes measurement challenges of this approach and develops a general protocol for the use of AI generated stimuli in experimental design.

My research is largely targeted to working professionals and academics with an interest in advanced marketing research techniques. Many of my papers are co-authored with industry practitioners from a variety of companies including Google, General Motors, The Modellers, Qualtrics, and Maritz Marketing Research. I am motivated to produce research that not only advances the state of the field, but also influences the practice of marketing research. Many of my working papers and new projects continue this trend. I believe this connection to practice increases the diffusion and impact of my work and makes me a better, more relevant instructor.

1. # Overview

  

My research and course development primarily focus on how retailers can use algorithms to make better revenue management[^1] decisions, including pricing, product display, and assortment planning. In the retail industry, anticipating consumer demand is arguably one of the biggest challenges for a retailer’s decision making. Errors in demand predictions typically lead to poor revenue management decisions, e.g., prices being set too high or too low, leading to lost profit from either excess inventory or stock-outs. Over the last decade, with the growing amount of data retailers capture, retailers are now considering how they can use these data to help predict demand and improve revenue management decisions. My research in this stream, “Developing Algorithms for Retail Revenue Management”, develops new machine learning and optimization algorithms to predict consumer demand and improve decision making, with theoretical, numerical, and/or experimental evidence that each algorithm performs well in practice.[^2] Compared to existing algorithms in the field, I aim to bring more realism to modeling consumers’ preferences and managers’ decisions in order to more accurately predict consumer demand, offer more realistic advice to managers, and be applicable to a wider variety of retail settings so that more retailers can adopt revenue management algorithms. Taken together, my work demonstrates how retailers can achieve great benefits from using data and algorithms to help them make key revenue management decisions.

  

In part motivated by my industry collaborations, my research stream “Strategically Limiting Customers’ Search and Purchases in E-Commerce” develops and analyzes mathematical models that challenge the common belief held by managers at many e-commerce companies that they should make it as easy as possible for customers to search their catalog of products and make purchases. My work in this stream has led to two key insights. First, online retailers may benefit from making it more difficult for customers to find their most preferred products. Second, limiting purchases in an online marketplace can improve system-wide customer experience and engagement. These findings offer insights for both retailers engaging in e-commerce as well as for digital platforms providing online marketplaces.

  

As part of my research process, I have engaged with many managers across different industries to learn how they are thinking about using data and algorithms to drive decision making. Many managers recognize that algorithms are able to process significantly more data than humans, uncovering important relationships that drive predictions and making recommendations that would be difficult for humans to identify. That said, many managers also understand that data and algorithms cannot capture all of the nuances of a decision-making problem, and that employees often have additional information or contextual knowledge that they should consider in tandem with algorithmic recommendations when making decisions. As I look ahead, I plan to shift my research focus to what I believe is the next critical challenge faced by managers: employees equipped with algorithmic recommendations to aid their decision making often make errors by either discounting or adhering to algorithmic recommendations when they should not do so. This is a big problem: if users do not effectively incorporate data and algorithms in their decision making, the organization will not realize the algorithms’ full potential or limitations. In my future work, I seek to understand the root causes underlying this poor use of algorithmic recommendations and provide advice to managers as to how the potential of those algorithms might be better realized.

## II.A Developing Algorithms for Retail Revenue Management

  

Predicting retail demand and making revenue management decisions are core problems that retailers and academics have been grappling with for years. Most existing algorithms in the field require a large number of customers or heavy analytical machinery to improve algorithmic convergence properties, but to do so, these algorithms require strict – and often unrealistic – assumptions about consumers’ and managers’ decisions. I take a different approach: through conversations with practitioners, I identify critical assumptions made in most existing algorithms that are typically not reflective of reality, and I develop algorithms tailored to settings where these assumptions do not hold. I focus on the following two objectives when developing new algorithms:

  

1. **Bringing more realism to modeling consumers’ decisions.** I develop algorithms that do not require strong assumptions often made about consumers’ preferences and purchase decisions, e.g., that consumers have homogenous preferences. Doing so improves demand prediction accuracy, which in turn improves decision making.

2. **Bringing more realism to modeling managers’ decisions.** I develop algorithms that do not require the strong assumptions often made that oversimplify the managers’ decisions, e.g., that managers have unlimited inventory to sell to consumers. Doing so allows retailers to use algorithms in a wider variety of settings.

  

To evaluate each algorithm’s effectiveness, I provide both mathematical deductive proof as well as empirical evidence that indicate that the algorithm should perform well; furthermore, I often show that proposed algorithms not tailored to these settings perform poorly. Unlike most other work in the field, I often partner with retailers to implement the algorithm and conduct a controlled field experiment that compares decisions made by the algorithm vs. the retailer’s existing approach. When field experiments are not possible, I make this comparison by conducting simulations of the algorithm on the retailer’s historical data. I show that these algorithms can make a huge impact in practice by significantly increasing important revenue management metrics such as revenue, profitability, and customer engagement.

  

### II.A.i *Bringing More Realism to Modeling Consumers’ Decisions*

  

One common assumption made about consumers’ purchase decisions is that as a product’s price increases, consumers are less likely to purchase it. Although this is certainly a reasonable assumption for many products, prior academic work and practitioners have recognized that such an assumption is not always valid for product categories such as fashion apparel and luxury goods for which higher prices may signal exclusivity and/or higher quality. Similarly, other common assumptions about consumers’ purchase decisions are often not supported by data in practice, e.g., consumer demand is a linear function of price. Such assumptions are often made in consumer demand models in order to achieve mathematical tractability when estimating their parameters and using them as inputs to optimization models for decision making. Rather than using rigid consumer demand models common in the literature, I saw the opportunity to use a different approach: machine learning. Many machine learning models are known to be quite flexible, imposing very little structure on how inputs such as price are related to the predicted quantity; these relationships are instead learned directly from the data.

  

Together with coauthors B.H. Alex Lee and David Simchi-Levi, I collaborated with Rue La La, an online flash sales retailer that sells hundreds of new fashion apparel products each day, to apply machine learning algorithms to improve demand prediction and pricing decisions (**“Analytics for an Online Retailer: Demand Forecasting and Price Optimization”** (P1), *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*). Indeed, we found that a flexible machine learning algorithm, regression trees,[^3] worked particularly well predicting demand. However, using its predictions for price optimization led to a significant tractability challenge (i.e., not being able to identify an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time), so we developed a novel algorithm to solve the price optimization problem efficiently. One potential issue with using machine learning for demand prediction is that a causal relationship between price and demand is not guaranteed. To evaluate this causal relationship, and most importantly, the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice, we implemented it at Rue La La and conducted a field experiment that found our algorithm increased revenue by 9.7% with no change in quantity sold.

  

This work was one of the first academic papers to propose using machine learning (other than simple linear or logistic regression) for demand prediction and as an input to revenue management decisions. In addition, ours is one of the first revenue management algorithms to be implemented in practice and evaluated using a controlled field experiment. For these contributions, our paper was named a finalist for the M\&SOM Best Paper Award (twice), first place for the INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Section Practice Award, and second place for the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award.

  

As a complement to this paper, I partnered with Karim Lakhani to write a case motivated by the work I had done with Rue La La, **“Flashion: Art vs. Science in Fashion Retailing”** (C1). The case and teaching note illustrate more broadly how machine learning can be used in conjunction with optimization for improved decision making. Our case has been taught in the Digital Innovation & Transformation and Supply Chain Management courses in the MBA program, numerous Executive Education programs, the Harvard Business Analytics Program, and at over twenty other universities.

  

In addition to pricing, I have studied another important revenue management decision for online retailers: product ranking. Product ranking refers to the order in which products are displayed on the retailer’s website and is important because most consumers scroll through limited products before making purchase decisions. Therefore, product ranking decisions are critical to drive customer engagement and sales. Though the problem of product ranking is not new, most existing algorithms make assumptions about consumer preferences that are often unrealistic. For example, two common assumptions made for mathematical tractability are that every customer has the same probability of clicking on each product and that a customer’s level of interest in each of two products is independent. In reality, there are numerous subpopulations of customers with distinct preferences, and if a customer clicks on one product, she is more likely to click on similar or complementary products. Furthermore, existing work only considers the setting where customers shop with the intent to purchase, and customers buy at most one product from a set of substitutable products. To better reflect reality, I am also interested in studying settings where customers exhibit hedonic browsing behavior (akin to window shopping) and products are not necessarily substitutable.

  

When making the restrictive assumptions common in the existing literature, the ranking that maximizes the number of customers that click on a product – a common proxy for customer engagement with the site – is simply the popularity ranking obtained by sorting products in descending order of click probabilities. However, when these assumptions do not hold – as in the contexts I study – the popularity ranking often performs quite poorly. Thus, Shreyas Sekar, Sunanda Parthasarathy, and I develop a novel algorithm that balances product popularity with diversity – the notion of appealing to a large variety of customer subpopulations. We show that our algorithm maximizes total customer engagement with the site, an objective common to online retailers looking to gain market share (**“Learning to Rank an Assortment of Products”** (P2), *Management Science*). One big challenge we face is that in reality, the retailer does not know the set of products that each customer subpopulation prefers prior to shopping. A common approach is to estimate these preferences by offering different rankings over time and observing which products customers click on. Unfortunately, this is an unrealistic approach when there are multiple customer subpopulations, requiring data from billions of customers to adequately learn customer preferences. To address this issue, we design our dynamic ranking algorithm to learn the optimal ranking directly, without ever having to learn product preferences for each customer subpopulation. We partnered with Wayfair to estimate the impact of our algorithm in practice via simulations using actual clickstream data, and we find that our algorithm yields a significant increase (5-30%) in the number of customers that engage with the site.

  

Throughout much of my research in this stream and related conversations with business leaders, the topic of personalization has often arisen. For example, rather than making product ranking decisions that are agnostic to customer characteristics (e.g., historical purchasing behavior), would it be beneficial to make different decisions for different market segments? The standard approach is to first perform market segmentation by clustering customers according to similarities in their characteristics, and then fit a demand model to each segment that is a function of the retailer’s decisions. This sequential approach inherently assumes that customer characteristics critical in distinguishing clusters are also key drivers of demand, when in fact this assumption often does not reflect reality; for example, gender may be a characteristic that distinguishes clusters yet does not differentiate buying behavior within all product categories. Ali Aouad, Adam Elmachtoub, Ryan McNellis and I developed a new machine learning algorithm that removes this assumption by integrating market segmentation and demand modeling; namely, the algorithm’s novelty is that market segmentations are explicitly driven by identifying differences in customer demand models (**“Market Segmentation Trees”** (P3), major revision *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*). We prove that our algorithm is computationally tractable on large datasets, and we numerically assess its practical performance on several synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that our method reliably finds market segmentations that accurately model customer demand. We believe that our work will help retailers more meaningfully segment their customers and improve personalized decision making.

  

### II.A.ii *Bringing More Realism to Modeling Managers’ Decisions*

  

One common simplifying assumption made in revenue management algorithms is that there is unlimited inventory available for the retailer to sell. This is clearly not a realistic assumption in many situations, yet is often made for mathematical tractability. Motivated by my work with Rue La La, David Simchi-Levi, He Wang, and I developed a new machine learning algorithm for demand learning and dynamic pricing that incorporates inventory constraints (**“Online Network Revenue Management using Thompson Sampling”** (P4), *Operations Research*).

  

The idea behind most existing demand learning and dynamic pricing algorithms is that demand may be unknown by the retailer at the beginning of the season, but can be learned with increasing accuracy by observing consumer purchase decisions at different price points. As the season progresses and the retailer has a better understanding of demand, the retailer can use this knowledge to set prices that maximize revenue with greater confidence. Inventory constraints add a new challenge to this approach. Namely, offering a variety of prices early in the season to learn demand comes at the cost of expending inventory. If too much inventory is expended trying to learn demand, the retailer may not have much inventory left to capitalize on this knowledge when setting prices later in the season.

  

Our algorithm modifies an existing machine learning algorithm, Thompson sampling, to incorporate inventory constraints when dynamically changing prices. We prove that our algorithm has strong theoretical performance guarantees and show that it has promising numerical performance results. Importantly, we also show that existing demand learning and dynamic pricing algorithms that do not account for inventory constraints often perform quite poorly. Notably, our work was one of the first academic papers to develop a machine learning algorithm that incorporates operational constraints in revenue management. For this work, we were awarded the M\&SOM Best Operations Management Paper in *Operations Research* Award.

  

When discussing dynamic pricing with retailers, I uncovered an additional assumption that oversimplified managers’ decisions: managers are able and willing to incur unlimited price changes throughout a selling season at negligible cost. Beyond the cost that brick-and-mortar retailers must incur to physically change prices, both brick-and-mortar and online retailers expressed concerns about negative customer perception due to dynamic pricing. Furthermore, many retailers described a trend towards changing their assortment of products more frequently, and some retailers suggested that changing prices only at the beginning of each new assortment would be desirable. However, this would lead to a fundamentally different type of demand learning and pricing algorithm: rather than learning the demand for a product via changing its price and observing its own sales, the algorithm would have to learn the demand for a product via setting prices and observing sales of products in earlier assortments, transferring learning from one assortment to the next.

  

With this feedback in mind, Emily Mower and I developed one of the first demand learning and pricing algorithms that learns quickly in an environment with frequent assortment changes and limited price changes; to do so, we adapt the commonly used marketing technique of conjoint analysis to our setting (**“Demand Learning and Pricing for Varying Assortments”** (P5), *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*). We collaborated with Zenrez, an e-commerce company that partners with fitness studios to sell excess capacity of fitness classes, to implement our algorithm in a controlled field experiment and found that our algorithm led to a sustained increase in average daily revenue of 14-18%, illustrating that our algorithmic contribution can make a significant impact in practice. Our algorithm is the only multi-product demand learning and pricing algorithm in the literature to be implemented and evaluated using a controlled field experiment. Our work was named a finalist for the M\&SOM Practice-Based Research Competition, as well as for the INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Section Practice Award.

  

Through a connection I made presenting my work in this stream, I identified an opportunity to write a case about the application of an inventory allocation analytics tool (nicknamed, JIAT) developed and implemented at JOANN, a leading fabrics and crafts retailer. This led to the case **“JOANN: Joannalytics Inventory Allocation Tool”** (C2) with Srikanth Jagabathula. Like much of my research, JIAT had two components: machine learning for demand prediction and optimization for decision making. Here, the decisions consisted of how much inventory to allocate from JOANN’s distribution centers to its stores on a weekly basis. Despite JIAT appearing to meet its expectations in saving time and better matching supply and demand, several parts of the organization raised serious concerns about JIAT. By uncovering the root causes of these concerns, students recognize that negative impacts from a decision support tool can be due to either technical errors and/or a lack of change to decision-making processes impacted by the tool. Furthermore, this case highlights the interconnectedness of many supply chain decisions and the importance of communication across decision makers when one of the decisions or decision-making processes changes. Our case has been taught in the Supply Chain Management course in the MBA program, the Harvard Business Analytics Program, and at numerous other universities.

  

In conducting my research, I have noted the inherent assumption of nearly all existing algorithms that managers are capable of and interested in using algorithms to help guide their decision making. Both the **JOANN** and **Flashion** cases (C2 and C1), however, highlight that this is not always true: there is often a lack of understanding of and buy-in for using algorithms to aid decision making. Important components of implementing algorithmic decision support tools involve educating employees about them and working closely with those employees to integrate their expertise with data and analytics. These cases explore how to execute these components and have played a significant role in motivating my future research plans described in Section III.

  

Finally, related to my work developing algorithms, I have also coauthored a note that teaches students how to evaluate prediction accuracy of various types of machine learning algorithms (**“Assessing Prediction Accuracy of Machine Learning Models”** (N1) coauthored with Mike Toffel, Natalie Epstein, and Yael Grushka-Cockayne). This note presents common accuracy metrics and considerations that should be accounted for when selecting an algorithm and has been used in both required and elective courses in the MBA program.

  

## II.B Strategically Limiting Customers’ Search and Purchases in E-Commerce

  

My research in the flash sales industry caused me to question the widely held belief that e-commerce companies should make it as easy as possible for customers to search their catalogs of products and make purchases. Specifically, I noticed that flash sales retailers only display a small subset of their products on their site on a given day, effectively restricting customers from viewing and purchasing the majority of the products that the retailer owns. Such observations motivated this research stream, in which I develop and analyze mathematical models to understand how e-commerce firms can strategically limit customers’ ability to search for products and make purchases. My work in this stream has led to two key (and seemingly counterintuitive) insights:

  

1. Online retailers may benefit from making it *more difficult* for customers to find their most preferred products.

2. *Limiting purchases* in an online marketplace can improve system-wide customer experience and engagement.

  

I describe each insight below.

  

### II.B.i *Online retailers may benefit from making it more difficult for customers to find their most preferred products*

  

One way retailers can make it more difficult for customers to find their most preferred products is – like flash sales and fast fashion retailers – by dividing their seasonal catalog of products across multiple assortments (subsets of products) rotated throughout the season, as opposed to offering all products in a single assortment available for the whole season. By doing so, retailers force customers to make purchase decisions on early-season products before they are able to search the entire season’s assortment and potentially find their most preferred products. Together with Joel Goh, our main idea is that concealing some product offerings from customers injects uncertainty into the consumer’s relative product valuations since the customer is unable to observe the entire catalog of products the retailer will sell that season. Rationally-acting consumers may respond to this additional uncertainty by purchasing more products, thereby generating additional sales for the retailer (**“Assortment Rotation and the Value of Concealment”** (P6), *Management Science*). We refer to the value of this phenomenon as the value of concealment. We develop a mathematical model that captures the value of concealment and show the conditions under which the value of concealment is positive vs. negative. Surprisingly, even for strategic consumers who anticipate the retailer’s incentives and decisions, we find that the combination of the following three characteristics leads to a positive value of concealment: (i) consumers’ diminishing marginal utility from purchasing additional products, (ii) consumers’ uncertainty in future product valuations or price heterogeneity, and (iii) a limited number of products offered by the retailer in the category. Our insights help retailers decide which products to sell with frequent assortment rotations vs. which products to sell in a constant, single assortment.

  

Even when online retailers offer all of their products \- not concealing any of their catalog \- they can still make it more difficult for customers to find their most preferred products. For example, online retailers can deliberately make it harder for consumers to locate discounted items (which many customers may prefer) on their site by removing the option of sorting products by price or filtering on discounted products. Although most online retailers invest in helping consumers find their most preferred products, Donald Ngwe, Thales Teixeira, and I found that by deliberately making it more difficult for customers to locate discounted items online, retailers could actually achieve higher margins and even increase conversion (**“The Impact of Increasing Search Frictions on Online Shopping Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment”** (P7), *Journal of Marketing Research*). We developed a simple theoretical framework that illustrates how making it more difficult for consumers to first inspect discounted items increases the average price of items sold, as expected, and more surprisingly, may simultaneously increase the overall expected purchase probability by inducing consumers to search more products. We empirically validate these results via a field experiment at Zalora, an online fashion apparel retailer in Southeast Asia.

  

### II.B.ii *Limiting purchases in an online marketplace can improve system-wide customer experience and engagement*

  

With the rise of online marketplaces as a special type of e-commerce, I have also studied how firms can strategically limit customers’ ability to match with sellers to make a purchase. For example, online marketplaces may want to prevent customers matching with sellers if the purchase is not profitable for the marketplace and/or seller. My research shows that online marketplaces may want to be even more restrictive, not allowing purchases to occur even when they would be profitable. The main idea is that since the customers and sellers in these marketplaces are interconnected, there is an opportunity cost incurred by allowing each purchase because the purchase may use up shared resources that are required for other, potentially more profitable, purchases. These shared resources may be owned by either the marketplace – e.g., customer service capacity to ensure a successful purchase – or the seller – e.g., supply chain capacity to deliver the purchase on time.

  

This is a key lesson from a case that I wrote with the online marketplace Drizly, **“Drizly: Managing Supply and Demand through Disruption”** (C3), which allows consumers to browse and purchase alcohol from local liquor stores via an app for immediate home delivery. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, suddenly more consumers were buying alcohol online rather than by visiting retailers in person, resulting in record-breaking growth for Drizly. Although Drizly’s management team was ecstatic to have such growth, its excitement didn’t come without concerns. The average delivery time well-exceeded the 60-minute customer promise, the percent of orders cancelled was experiencing a five-fold increase, and customer complaints were not being answered in a timely manner. The case asks what changes Drizly should make, if any, to ensure the long-term success of the company. Key solutions include Drizly allowing only purchases most likely to be successful to occur, which students can characterize via data analysis using the case’s spreadsheet supplement. In doing so, Drizly can improve customer experience metrics for *all* customers who interact with Drizly’s customer service group, leading to their long-term engagement with the marketplace. My case has been taught in the Supply Chain Management course in the MBA program, the Harvard Business Analytics Program, and other universities.

  

Similarly, I study how restricting purchases can be beneficial in a special kind of online marketplace called a scrip system. Scrips are coupons that are used in place of currency to exchange goods and services, and scrip systems are markets that use scrips rather than money. Key questions when designing a scrip system include how to match buyers and sellers and how many scrips to inject in the system. David Simchi-Levi, Peng Sun, and I develop a mathematical model of a scrip system and show that it is optimal to only allow purchases to occur between a buyer and the potential seller with the least amount of scrips (**“Analyzing Scrip Systems”** (P8), *Operations Research*). We show that this restriction can lead to far superior participant experience and long-term engagement compared to allowing the buyer to choose any potential seller when quality is identical across sellers. Furthermore, we show that injecting more scrips into the system is better, but only up to a threshold after which members start leaving the system.

  

3. # Future Research Plans

  

Through my experiences at HBS, I have gained broad exposure to how leaders across many industries think about using data and algorithms to drive decision making, including the many challenges they face in doing so. I am fascinated by this topic because it has both a technical and behavioral component. On the technical side, the critical challenge has been developing algorithms that bring more realism to modeling consumers’ and managers’ decisions. This is what I tackle in my research for retail revenue management, and I plan on continuing to conduct research in this area in the future. For example, I will continue improving (P3) and am currently working on a new case in this area with Gamze Yucaoglu on Arcelik, a Turkish multinational home appliances manufacturer. This case will emphasize the value of data and algorithms and how they can improve supply chain decisions.

  

I predict that the next critical challenge faced by business leaders will be more behavioral than technical in nature. Namely, many algorithms are implemented as decision support tools – providing recommendations as inputs for those making decisions. Users must decide if and how to incorporate algorithmic recommendations in their decisions. It is well understood in practice that users of algorithms – whether retail merchandisers, physicians, HR managers, or others – often make errors by either discounting or adhering too strongly to algorithmic recommendations when they should not do so. Yet, managers typically do not consider such errors when implementing algorithms. These errors are incredibly costly: simply put, if users do not effectively incorporate algorithmic recommendations in their decision making, the organization cannot realize the algorithms’ full potential or limitations and may even incur costs from using algorithms incorrectly.

  

In my future work, I aim to address the following critical questions:

  

1. Why do users fail to adequately incorporate high-quality algorithmic recommendations into their decisions?

2. Why do users fail to discount poor algorithmic recommendations in their decisions?

3. How should managers guide the development and communication of algorithms in order for users to best incorporate algorithmic recommendations when making decisions?

  

Similar to my objectives in the “Developing Algorithms for Retail Revenue Management” stream, answering these questions will help bring more realism to considering how algorithms are used in practice, which likely has implications for how algorithms are designed and communicated. In order to tackle these questions, I plan to add one more technique to my methodological toolkit – lab experiments – which will allow me to isolate and test numerous hypotheses more quickly than in the field. Based on my learnings from these lab experiments, I plan to then conduct field experiments to test hypotheses in practice, and ultimately use findings to advise managers how to better develop and deploy algorithms in their team’s decision making. I am excited about the potential opportunities that the D3 Institute offers in helping scale my research in this area.

  

As an example of an ongoing research project that I am pursuing with Maya Balakrishnan and Jordan Tong on this topic, consider the common problem of retail demand forecasting where a machine learning algorithm forecasts demand very well for only some (unidentified) subclasses of products but not others. This problem is known as “hidden stratification” and may arise, for example, when the algorithm cannot capture all important inputs to predict demand. In fact, this is one of the primary reasons why algorithms are deployed as decision support tools – as opposed to fully automated tools – in practice: there are often situations for which the users have valuable information that the algorithm does not have access to. In these situations, ideally the users should incorporate this additional information in their decisions. Our experimental lab results show that when users experience the algorithm’s recommendations on more products from subclasses for which the algorithm performs poorly, they adhere less to the algorithm’s recommendations for *all* products, even for product subclasses for which the algorithm performs very well. We also find the opposite to be true: when users experience the algorithm’s recommendations on more products from subclasses for which the algorithm performs very well, they adhere more to the algorithm’s recommendations for *all* products, even for product subclasses for which the algorithm performs poorly. Our detailed results from these experiments, along with corresponding theory that we have developed from mathematical models, suggest that users view an algorithm’s past performance in aggregate, rather than trying to determine whether it performs well for some product subclasses and poorly for others. This leads users to erroneously incorporate algorithmic recommendations the same way in decision making, regardless of product subclass.

  

One potential explanation of this behavior is that the lack of transparency into the algorithm and input features it uses makes it too difficult for the user to identify subclasses of products where the algorithm performs well vs. poorly. To test this hypothesis, we are running subsequent lab experiments that give some users more transparency into the algorithm and input features it uses. We will then measure the extent to which their use of the algorithm improves, i.e., whether they adhere more to the algorithm’s recommendations when the algorithm is expected to perform well and make better adjustments to the algorithm’s recommendations when the algorithm is expected to perform poorly. It is unclear whether more transparency will improve their use or not. On the one hand, the user should be better able to differentially adjust algorithmic recommendations by product subclasses. On the other hand, will the human forecaster lose trust or confidence in the algorithm for *all* products if they know it is unable to account for all relevant information? I am excited to dive deeper into this line of research.

  

By understanding the root causes underlying why users make poor use of algorithmic recommendations and by providing a toolkit of interventions to help address each root cause, I hope that my future work will position managers to develop and communicate algorithms in a way that maximizes their potential.

  

4. # Teaching and Course Maintenance

  

I truly value the importance HBS places on top-quality teaching and the resources and culture in place to help mentor junior faculty to become effective teachers. In my first two years at HBS, I taught three sections of RC TOM and greatly benefitted from the leadership of our course head, Mike Toffel, as well as the other RC TOM faculty and Willis Emmons, each of whom helped me develop into an effective case teacher. After three subsequent teaching reliefs (two parental and one research development credit), I transitioned to the Elective Curriculum in the 2020-2021 academic year where I taught the Supply Chain Management (SCM) course. I am immensely grateful to Jan Hammond for her mentorship throughout my transition to the EC.

  

SCM builds on aspects of RC TOM and focuses on managing material and information flows across both functional and organizational boundaries. I restructured the course into the following four modules, which included 13 new sessions: Transportation & Network Design, Inventory Management, Demand Forecasting & Planning, and Frontier Topics in Supply Chain Management. The first three modules present both analytical tools and strategic considerations to guide managerial decisions. For example, in the third module, students learn basic time-series forecasting and machine learning models to predict demand, and then learn how to apply these models for decision making by accounting for other strategic considerations, such as in **Flashion** (C1). As another example, for the second module, I created technical problem sets and corresponding teaching material to help teach the mechanics of common inventory management models. After mastering the underlying mechanics, students then learn how to apply these models to more strategic inventory management problems presented in several cases, including inventory allocation at **JOANN** (C2). Finally, in the fourth module, I discuss additional timely and important topics related to supply chain management, such as supply chain disruptions in **Drizly** (C3).

  

In addition to the cases I described in earlier sections that are related to my research, I have also written two cases for the purpose of expanding the topics covered in SCM. The first such case is **“GHN and AhaMove: Last-Mile Delivery in Vietnam”** (C4) with Joel Goh, Dawn Lau, and Tuan Phan. This case is about a company in the last-mile logistics industry in Vietnam that is exploring how to supplement its traditional operating model for last-mile logistics with a modern, on-demand operating model that exploits the ubiquity of smartphone and mobile internet use in Vietnam. Students identify the advantages and challenges of each model, as well as possible synergies that could be realized by utilizing both models concurrently. In addition to introducing a modern logistics model into the curriculum, this case helps diversify the geographies considered in SCM to developing country contexts in Southeast Asia.

  

The second case that I have written to expand the topics covered in SCM is **“Diversifying P\&G’s Supplier Base (A) and (B)”** (C5) with Kym Lew Nelson, Carin-Isabel Knoop, and Sarah Mehta. The case describes P\&G’s journey to achieving a more diverse and inclusive supply chain, highlighting its relationship with Infinity Services, a minority-owned furniture installation business. Students are tasked with considering why supplier diversity is important to firm performance in terms of inclusion, operational, and financial considerations, as well as the challenges in achieving supplier diversity and possible ways to address them.

  

My first time teaching the SCM course in Spring 2021 was well-received by students, and I’m looking forward to teaching and improving this course in the years to come. In line with my future plans, I intend to create a module on “Using Algorithms to Drive Decisions”. This module could be taught in a supply chain, operations, or business analytics course. The objectives of this module would be to expose students to applications of algorithms across the supply chain, to help students understand how to integrate such algorithms into existing supply chain processes, and to teach students how managers can ensure that both algorithmic recommendations and human expertise are incorporated into decision making. As algorithms become more prevalent and important in business, I believe that our students would greatly benefit from such a module. My cases on **Flashion** (C1), **JOANN** (C2), and **Arcelik** (in development) would fit well in this module, and I intend to supplement these cases with new cases tightly related to my future research plans.

  

Outside of my core teaching responsibilities in the MBA program, I have also taught in the Harvard Business Analytics Program (HBAP) and in numerous Executive Education programs (both internal at HBS and external workshops). In HBAP, I have co-taught both the Digital Strategy & Innovation and Operations & Supply Chain Management courses. In Executive Education, I primarily teach sessions on how business leaders can use algorithms to help drive decisions, and I typically include a mix of case-based sessions and interactive lectures highlighting some of my research on the topic. I really enjoy interacting with the Executive Education participants and sharing my new research ideas with them, and I have found that their questions and feedback have highlighted important, current managerial challenges faced in practice. This, in turn, has helped guide my research. In fact, it is partly through my interactions with Executive Education participants that I have identified my future research questions and goals. I would like to continue participating in more Executive Education programs in the coming years, which will help ensure that my research continues to address important problems in practice.

  

5. # Service

  

## V.A Service to the Technology & Operations Management Unit

  

One of the main reasons I chose to join the HBS faculty was the kindness and thoughtfulness of the TOM faculty that I interacted with during my interviews, and the wonderful culture they developed. I strive to always uphold that same culture by offering to help colleagues in any way possible, including brainstorming research questions and case topics, participating in unit events, sharing teaching ideas, and advising and mentoring doctoral students. With regards to formal service within the unit, my main responsibility has been serving on the TOM Faculty Recruiting Committee since 2017, where I have helped evaluate prospective candidates for fly-out interview invitations. I enjoy this very much, as it gives me a great look into the most recent research in the broader TOM academic communities, and also helps build our unit capabilities and culture over time. I hope to continue to be on this committee in the future. I have also served on the TOM Doctoral Recruiting Committee and have helped interview and evaluate potential doctoral candidates. Finally, the year after I joined the faculty, I served as the TOM Unit Research Day Co-Coordinator, where I helped develop a 2-day long workshop for TOM faculty to introduce the topic of machine learning. It was wonderful to share the techniques behind much of my research and hear from my colleagues how they thought machine learning could be helpful in their own areas of expertise.

  

## V.B Service to Harvard Business School

  

I have also served on several school-wide committees since joining HBS. One of my favorites has been serving as the Research Track Co-Lead for the Digital Transformation Task Force in 2021\. In this role, I had the chance to meet with numerous faculty across the school to learn about the types of research they do and the pain points they experience in conducting their research, and ultimately to help brainstorm and propose a short-term and long-term vision for how HBS can employ digital transformation to help faculty achieve even greater research goals. I felt like I was able to use some of my technical knowledge regarding what is (and isn’t\!) possible in the data and analytics space to help guide some of our recommendations. I have also served on the Advisory Group for Research Computing since 2018\. Our faculty group meets regularly with the Research Computing team to discuss improvements to best serve its faculty constituents. I hope to continue to serve in this group moving forward, and in general, would be thrilled to contribute my research-related expertise to support the HBS community.

  

In addition, I have also enjoyed serving the MBA and HBAP student communities in capacities beyond teaching. I have advised numerous MBA Independent Projects, typically relating to the use of data and analytics in the retail industry. For the HBAP community, I have participated in numerous Immersions, where the students attend a multi-day immersive experience with several program faculty. During these immersions, I have led case discussions, served as a panelist, and hosted coffee chats. In addition, I have served as a judge for an essay contest open to HBAP students on the topic of “Future of Work, Business Leadership, and Managerial Decision Making in an AI-Driven World”. I look forward to continuing my service to these student communities.

  

## V.C Service to the Broader Academic Community

  

Outside of HBS, I have remained an active member of the broader academic community by regularly presenting my research at top conferences and other universities, organizing conference sessions at the INFORMS annual meeting, serving on the Program Committee for the INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Conference, and reviewing numerous papers for top journals in the field, including *Management Science*, *Operations Research*, and *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*, for which I have been awarded the *M\&SOM Meritorious Service Award* multiple times. I have also served as a judge for the MSOM Student Paper Competition multiple times, as well as on the INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Student Paper Award Committee. I enjoy interacting with the broader academic community and staying up to date on the most current research in the field.

  

### 6.  Concluding Remarks



I am thankful to be a part of the HBS faculty and believe that my experiences here have helped me grow into a productive and impactful scholar. I am especially thankful for the mentorship I have received from my colleagues and exposure I have had to a wide variety of business leaders who have helped improve my work. I am excited to pursue my future research plans and believe that they have great potential to impact how businesses across many industries effectively use algorithms for decision making. I am looking forward to bringing this research into the classroom and helping our students become more effective managers in a world where algorithms are growing more prevalent. I hope that I have the chance to continue my career at HBS as I further grow and contribute as an academic. Thank you for your consideration.

[^1]: The field of “revenue management” aims to solve problems related to the management and pricing of scarce or perishable products. Although the field’s name excludes costs for historical reasons, both revenue and costs are considered in most contemporary revenue management work.
[^2]: Machine Learning is often used as a *predictive analytics tool* known for its ability to learn from data to make predictions. Optimization is a *prescriptive analytics tool* that identifies solutions that maximize or minimize an objective subject to constraints.
[^3]: Regression trees map input data to a prediction via nested if-else conditions, which are algorithmically identified to maximize predictive accuracy on a historical data set.
