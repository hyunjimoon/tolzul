1. the meaning of “empirical model” differ between operations and strategy/econ fields. operations tend to associate Y with objective function more strongly compared to strategy and econ. hence, hypothesis is set using optimization model. (three samples each from ORC vs TIES)

2. severe politics in strategy academia and journals, especially in fields without measurement (e.g. resource-based view VS transaction cost economics).

3. industry experts value operations skillset higher than strategy. SFMBA students liked “Intro to OM” class much useful than I expected.
