### 1\. First, clearly structure your thinking around opportunities, actively pursuing them regardless of your current resources.

**Why computational thinking?**  
Entrepreneurs face complex environments with shifting opportunities and constraints. Computational thinking enables entrepreneurs to systematically approach opportunities by breaking down large problems (**decomposition**) and focusing clearly on critical patterns (**abstraction of process**). Entrepreneurs can create strategies (**algorithmic thinking**) to methodically pursue opportunities independent of resource limitations.

**Keywords:**  
- Decomposition  
- Abstraction of process  
- Algorithmic thinking

### 2\. Next, creatively imagine possibilities, proactively managing the tension between vision and available resources.

**Why computational thinking?**  
Entrepreneurship involves continually balancing visionary creativity against resource realities. Computational thinking provides tools for representing and analyzing complex situations (**modeling physical and social worlds**) and supports effective decision-making amidst complexity (**managing trade-offs and complexity**). It equips entrepreneurs with structured yet creative methods to explore alternative paths clearly and systematically.

**Keywords:**  
- Modeling physical and social worlds  
- Managing trade-offs and complexity

### 3\. Finally, continuously refine your approach, openly adapting your strategies as resources and opportunities evolve.

**Why computational thinking?**  
Entrepreneurs constantly face changing conditions and must adapt their strategies iteratively. Computational thinking emphasizes systematically reviewing and improving processes (**iteration and recursion**), quickly identifying and correcting issues (**design and debugging**), and clearly communicating adjustments (**communication of structured thought**) to stakeholders.

**Keywords:**  
- Iteration and recursion  
- Design and debugging  
- Communication of structured thought
