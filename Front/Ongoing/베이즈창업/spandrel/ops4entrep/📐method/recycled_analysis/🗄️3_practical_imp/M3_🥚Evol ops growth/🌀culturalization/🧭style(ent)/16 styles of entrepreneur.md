# Toward Resourceful Rationality in Entrepreneurial Decisions

**Introduction.** Classic theory defines entrepreneurship as _“the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled”_ ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=our%20perspective,%20entrepreneurship%20is%20an,regard%20to%20resources%20currently%20controlled/)). Stevenson’s influential 1983 framework positions the entrepreneur as a “promoter” who is opportunity-driven and unconstrained by existing resources ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://xn--file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=formulation%20of%20strategy,the%20resources%20that%20i%20control%3F-in41e/)). While this captures the boldness of entrepreneurial action, it risks romanticizing _resource blindness_ – the notion of charging ahead ignoring practical limits. Recent research across Bayesian statistics, cognitive science, and strategic management suggests a more nuanced view. Entrepreneurs are _resourcefully rational_: they construct imaginative scenarios, update beliefs with available evidence, consider the cognitive and opportunity costs of delaying action, and phase their use of utility calculations. Below, we classify eight scholarly works from these domains along four key facets adapted from I. J. Good’s framework ([](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf#:~:text=sure%20that%20credibilities%20really%20exist%3B,judging%20final%20or%20posterior%20probabilities)) ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)). Each facet is coded “a” if the approach is explicitly used by the scholar or “b” if not (with “?” if unclear). The four facets are: **(1)** _Device of Imaginary Results_ (using “What if?” reasoning or hypothetical data to inform priors/decisions ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/))), **(2)** _Precision of Probability Judgments_ (whether probabilistic beliefs are sharp and quantitative, or only qualitatively/partially specified ([](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf#:~:text=be%20broken%20up%20into%20a,partially)) ([](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf#:~:text=inter%02national%20body,judging%20final%20or%20posterior%20probabilities))), **(3)** _Quasiutility 1: Cost of Theorizing_ (recognition of the cost of analysis or delay – Good’s “Type II rationality” where one decides _when to stop thinking_ ([](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf#:~:text=allows%20for%20the%20cost%20of,in%20any%20practical%20situation%20you))), and **(4)** _Quasiutility 2: No Utility Initially_ (whether the approach avoids or defers explicit utility/payoff calculations at the outset, focusing first on probabilities or other criteria ([](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf#:~:text=after%20they%20have%20been%20given,The))). We assign each paper a four-letter code (a/b for each facet) and group results by academic domain. This classification (see Table 1) reveals how each domain contributes to an integrated view of entrepreneurial decision-making. We then map all $2^4=16$ possible styles and identify which appear in the literature versus which remain underexplored. Finally, we propose a visualization of the “16-style space,” showing how insights from different domains complement each other in moving toward a theory of _resourceful rationality_ in entrepreneurship.

## Faceted Classification Across Domains

The table below synthesizes the eight works by domain, with each cell showing the collective facet code for that domain and a brief rationale with supporting evidence. Each code represents whether scholars in that domain **(a)** use or **(b)** do not use the corresponding facet. The **Key Contributions** column highlights how each domain informs entrepreneurial decision-making. (Citations refer to the specific works analyzed.)

Modern Bayesian analyses routinely employ _imaginary data_ or prior predictive checks to tune models ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)). For example, Gelman advocates Good’s _“device of imaginary results”_ to reveal incoherent priors ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)). (Older modeling approaches like classical discrete choice tend not to do this, focusing on observed data only.)                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             **a** – Sharp probabilities.

These statisticians rarely discuss _when to stop_ updating or modeling – they aim to fully use available data. The cost of extended analysis is not explicitly factored in their methods. The focus is on accuracy, not the time/effort spent reaching it (no mention of analysis cost in these primers/papers).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     **a** – Yes (no utility at first). Bayesian frameworks separate belief updating from utility. Inference is utility-neutral: _“optimal only when averaging over the prior”_ ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20put%20it%20another%20way,,of%20applicability%20of%20a%20method/)), and decisions are considered later. Utilities are typically _“brought in”_ only after probabilistic inference is complete, if at all. (Gelman notes that a statistical model _“does not know how it will be used in the decision problem”_ ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=check%20,day%20ahead%20prediction%20does%20not/)).)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Provides a **systematic method for reasoning under uncertainty**. Entrepreneurs can use Bayesian logic to imagine scenarios and update beliefs with sparse data ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)), rather than relying on gut feeling alone. This domain contributes tools for **prioritizing evidence over intuition** – e.g. running mental “experiments” to test assumptions – thereby tempering pure resource-blind optimism. However, by itself it downplays practical constraints (time costs, immediate payoffs), so it **risks analysis-paralysis** if not combined with other considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A core principle is that cognition is limited – there is a _cost to thinking_. Bhui et al. frame judgment as _“optimal under cognitive costs or constraints”_ ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=rationality%20by%20conceiving%20of%20judgment,as%20optimal%20under/)), and Ullman & Tenenbaum likewise assume a _“resource-constrained…program induction”_ by children ([5_Josh20_Bayesian models of conceptual development.pdf](file://file-qc7zpsdsa4tvps6h8zxadf%23:~:text=pret%20learning%20in%20both%20of,potential%20models,%20in%20particular%20the/)). These works highlight that deliberation time, mental effort, and information-processing capacity are costly, so decision-makers satisfice rather than exhaustively optimize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                 **a** – Yes (defer utility). These scholars do not start with classical utility maximization; instead they often focus on surrogate objectives (information, cognitive ease) or learning. For example, a child is seen as a scientist building intuitive theories ([5_Josh20_Bayesian models of conceptual development.pdf](file://file-qc7zpsdsa4tvps6h8zxadf%23:~:text=a%20bayesian%20framework%20helps%20address,,constrained,%20hierarchi/)), not as a utility calculator. And biases in adult decisions (reference dependence, etc.) are explained as _“a rational solution to the problem of resource-limited decision making”_ ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=and%20widespread%20phenomena:%20reference%20dependence,/)) ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=suggest%20that%20they%20may%20arise,a%20rational%20solution%20to%20the/)) – implying people initially emphasize manageable cues or simple goals over explicit profit/loss utility. Only later or implicitly is utility realized (e.g. as a consequence of an adaptive heuristic).                                                 | Provides a **realistic view of decision-makers’ limitations**, crucial for entrepreneurship. This domain contributes the idea that entrepreneurs’ seemingly irrational quirks (heuristics, overconfidence, etc.) may be **adaptive under cognitive and information constraints** ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=and%20widespread%20phenomena:%20reference%20dependence,/)). Entrepreneurs cannot calculate every risk–reward precisely; cognitive science explains how they **use simple rules or mental models to make good-enough decisions quickly**. This tempers the Bayesian ideal with pragmatism: entrepreneurs are rational _given their bounded resources_, not omniscient optimizers. It underlines the importance of **speed and frugality** in entrepreneurial decision-making, while still striving to do as well as possible with limited brainpower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Stevenson contrasts _“promoters”_ (entrepreneurs) who _“act in a very short time frame”_ with slow-moving trustees ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=the%20promoter%20is%20a%20person,are%20stationary;%20once%20there,%20they/)), noting **high costs of late entry** (missed opportunities) ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://xn--file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=%20short%20decision%20windows:%20due,of%20competitive%20costs%20and%20technology-ky00f/)). Camuffo et al. explicitly model a stopping rule where experimentation halts when its costs outweigh benefits ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20depends%20on%20the,11/)). In sum, theorizing and market testing are seen as valuable, but entrepreneurs vigilantly watch the clock and budget, knowing when to stop analyzing and start executing ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20when%20decision%20makers,discounted,%20decision%20makers%20stop%20experimenting/)). | **a** – Yes (defer utility). Opportunity-first, resource-second. Stevenson’s definition _“pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled”_ epitomizes delaying immediate resource/utilization concerns ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=our%20perspective,%20entrepreneurship%20is%20an,regard%20to%20resources%20currently%20controlled/)). Entrepreneurs in this view commit to an idea _before_ fully calculating exact payoffs or securing all resources ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://xn--file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=on%20resources:%20i%20will%20prune,-o420cwc/)). Camuffo et al. similarly describe formulating theories (identifying possible states and probabilities) _prior_ to evaluating expected value ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=3,for%20exam/)) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=in%20contrast,%20with%20low,however,%20through%20logical%20reasoning/)). Only after imagining a viable opportunity space do they seek to acquire resources and realize utility. | Offers a **contextual and process-oriented view** of entrepreneurial decisions. From this domain we learn that entrepreneurs **create structured narratives (“theories”) to make sense of uncertainty** ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://xn--file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=controlling%20opticians,demandthat%20led%20to%20optimal%20decisions-6t31e/)), and then act boldly but intelligently on those theories. Importantly, it highlights **timing and resource constraints**: an entrepreneur must decide fast (or risk opportunity decay) ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=the%20promoter%20is%20a%20person,are%20stationary;%20once%20there,%20they/)) ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://xn--file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=%20short%20decision%20windows:%20due,of%20competitive%20costs%20and%20technology-ky00f/)), and only later worry about detailed resource allocation. This contributes a model of the entrepreneur as a _theory-driven experimenter_ – not reckless, but _resourcefully opportunistic_. It cautions against purely romantic notions by showing that successful entrepreneurs balance vision with judicious checkpoints (knowing when to pivot or quit) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20when%20decision%20makers,discounted,%20decision%20makers%20stop%20experimenting/)). |

As the table shows, each domain brings a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding entrepreneurial decision-making. **Bayesian statistics** contributes methods for **imagining outcomes and updating beliefs** rigorously (facets 1 and 2 are “a”), but tends to ignore deliberation costs and rushes to convert beliefs into decisions only after full probability modeling (facet 3 “b”, facet 4 “a”). **Cognitive science** provides insight into **bounded rationality** – decisions made with limited time and information (facet 3 “a”) often using qualitative reasoning (facet 2 “b”) and simplified goals (facet 4 “a”), though without formal scenario analysis (facet 1 “b”). **Strategic management** emphasizes **opportunity framing and action under real-world constraints** – explicitly using creative hypotheses (facet 1 “a”) and knowing when further analysis will not pay off (facet 3 “a”), while deferring detailed utility calculations (facet 4 “a”) and relying on subjective likelihoods (facet 2 “b”). In combination, these perspectives paint entrepreneurship as _“resourceful rationality”_: entrepreneurs construct imaginative but disciplined mental models, update those models with experience, appreciate the cost of indecision, and only then pursue utility – _all within the constraints of limited cognition and resources_.

## A 16-Style Typology of Entrepreneurial Decision-Making

Each combination of the four facets corresponds to a distinct theoretical _decision-making style_. Table 2 below outlines all 16 possible styles (from `aaaa` to `bbbb`), indicating which have exemplars in the literature above and which appear underexplored. We label each style by its four-letter (a/b) code as defined earlier. For brevity “Imaginary” = use of imaginary results; “Precise” = sharp probability judgments; “Cost-aware” = recognizes cost of theorizing; “Utility-deferred” = no utility initially.

**Table 2.** Sixteen possible decision-making styles (a=uses/yes, b=does not use/no for each facet). **Bold** = styles represented by the selected works; _italics_ = particularly underexplored styles.

|**Style Code**|**Imaginary?**|**Precise?**|**Cost-aware?**|**Utility-deferred?**|**Example in Literature (if any)**|**Characterization of Style**|
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|
|**aaaa**|yes|yes|yes|yes|_(None of the eight works; idealized combination)_|**Universal Planner:** an ideal decision-maker who uses imaginative scenario analysis, quantifies beliefs exactly, **knows when to stop** analyzing ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20when%20decision%20makers,discounted,%20decision%20makers%20stop%20experimenting/)), and initially focuses on probabilities over immediate payoffs. (A perfectly resourceful Bayesian.)|
|aaab|yes|yes|yes|no|_No direct example_|**Analytical Decider:** uses hypothetical results and precise probabilities and considers analysis costs, **but** also brings in utility from the start. (E.g. a decision analyst who factors in computation cost yet optimizes expected utility from the outset – an uncommon combo.)|
|**aaba**|yes|yes|no|yes|**Bayesian stat “purist”** – van de Schoot et al. (2021) ([2_Andrew21_Bayesian statistics and modelling.pdf](file://file-tnjhdhvqghjlij9boahcob%23:~:text=prior%20predictive%20checking%20because%20inference,specified%20model%20can%20be%20considered/)); Gelman & Yao (2021) ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/))|**Classical Bayesian:** runs “what if” prior checks ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)) and uses exact probabilities, but assumes no cost to analysis (endless updating) and postpones utility considerations ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=check%20,day%20ahead%20prediction%20does%20not/)).|
|aabb|yes|yes|no|no|_No direct example_|**Bayesian Decision Optimizer:** imagines data and uses precise probabilities, but neither worries about analysis cost nor avoids utility – likely jumps straight to expected-utility decisions with a fully Bayesian model. (Possibly an idealized Savage-style decision-maker; rarely documented explicitly.)|
|**abaa**|yes|no|yes|yes|**Theory-driven entrepreneur** – Camuffo et al. (2024) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=in%20our%20framework,%20decision%20makers,when%20run/)) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20depends%20on%20the,11/)); Stevenson (1983) ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=gambler,others%20in%20commitment%20to%20action/)) ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=the%20promoter%20is%20a%20person,are%20stationary;%20once%20there,%20they/))|**Visionary Experimenter:** vividly imagines future scenarios ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=gambler,others%20in%20commitment%20to%20action/)), uses qualitative judgment (no precise odds) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=in%20contrast,%20with%20low,however,%20through%20logical%20reasoning/)), weighs the cost of delay or testing ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://xn--file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=%20short%20decision%20windows:%20due,of%20competitive%20costs%20and%20technology-ky00f/)), and pursues opportunity before fully calculating utility ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=our%20perspective,%20entrepreneurship%20is%20an,regard%20to%20resources%20currently%20controlled/)). (Describes successful entrepreneurs in uncertain domains.)|
|abab|yes|no|yes|no|_No direct example_|**Opportunistic Executor:** imagines scenarios and acknowledges thinking costs, but does not quantify probabilities _and_ immediately focuses on utility. (E.g. an entrepreneur who sketches a vision quickly and then straightaway calculates profit on that crude scenario. Rarely formalized – entrepreneurs usually lack precise data for upfront utility calc.)|
|abba|yes|no|no|yes|_No direct example_|**Theory-Driven Analyst (no utility):** uses imagination and defers utility, but **does not** consider analysis costs or precise probabilities. (Could be a visionary who brainstorms freely without much concern for time, yet isn’t thinking of immediate payoff – perhaps an academic theorist or R&D lab in “blue-sky” mode.)|
|abbb|yes|no|no|no|_No direct example_|**Dreamer with a Calculator:** uses imaginative “what if” thinking without formal probabilities or cost constraints, and jumps straight into pursuing a perceived payoff. (This _could_ describe a hasty, over-optimistic entrepreneur – someone who vividly pictures success and chases it, ignoring analysis discipline. While often warned against, we found no scholarly advocate of this unbridled style.)|
|**baaa**|no|yes|yes|yes|**Resource-rational learner** – Ullman & Tenenbaum (2020) ([5_Josh20_Bayesian models of conceptual development.pdf](file://file-qc7zpsdsa4tvps6h8zxadf%23:~:text=pret%20learning%20in%20both%20of,potential%20models,%20in%20particular%20the/)) ([5_Josh20_Bayesian models of conceptual development.pdf](file://file-qc7zpsdsa4tvps6h8zxadf%23:~:text=1956\),%20resource,rational%20approximations%20to%20the%20ideal/))|**Efficient Experimenter:** does not explicitly simulate hypothetical results, but does use precise (or at least formal) probabilities and is mindful of cognitive/resource costs ([5_Josh20_Bayesian models of conceptual development.pdf](file://file-qc7zpsdsa4tvps6h8zxadf%23:~:text=match%20at%20l2985%20entire%20set,as%20if%20occupying%20a/)), focusing on learning before utility. (Describes how children – or by analogy, entrepreneurs entering a new domain – optimally learn models under resource constraints.)|
|baab|no|yes|yes|no|_No direct example_|**Pragmatic Optimizer:** a decision-maker who builds a precise probabilistic model and knows when to stop refining it, but then immediately applies it to utility optimization. (E.g. an AI or strategist who sets a time limit on analysis and then maximizes expected value – plausible in theory, but not explicitly seen in our sample.)|
|baba|no|yes|no|yes|_No direct example (though compare many routine Bayesian analyses)_|**By-the-book Analyst:** relies on data (no imaginary scenarios) with precise probabilities and defers utility decisions, but ignores the cost of analysis. (Typical of many statistical analyses that iterate until convergence without considering time, and deliver probabilistic insights without making decisions.)|
|**babb**|no|yes|no|no|**Predictive modeler** – Hofman et al. (2021) ([2_Sendhil21_Integrating explanation and prediction in computational social science.pdf](file://file-bcdcqvtsjjvjjazu48zau2%23:~:text=prediction%20versus%20explanation%20to%20illustrate,a%20null%20hypothesis23,24%20that%20some/)) ([2_Sendhil21_Integrating explanation and prediction in computational social science.pdf](file://file-bcdcqvtsjjvjjazu48zau2%23:~:text=much%20to%20test%20predictions%20at,zero,%20in%20the%20complex%20world/)); Ben-Akiva (2025) ([1_Moshe24_Discrete choice analysis nested logit model.pdf](file://xn--file-ey7sthvoczkwjznqnybd7j%23:~:text=u%20t%20-xo5awg/)) ([1_Moshe24_Discrete choice analysis nested logit model.pdf](file://file-ey7sthvoczkwjznqnybd7j%23:~:text=p%20car%20car,%20redbus,%20bluebus,e/))|**Data-Driven Optimizer:** focuses on real data (no hypothetical results) and precise modeling, and then directly uses the model for decisions _without_ factoring analysis cost or separating out utility. For instance, Mullainathan’s integrative modelers aim to predict outcomes accurately and immediately inform policy/action ([2_Sendhil21_Integrating explanation and prediction in computational social science.pdf](file://file-bcdcqvtsjjvjjazu48zau2%23:~:text=prediction%20versus%20explanation%20to%20illustrate,a%20null%20hypothesis23,24%20that%20some/)) ([2_Sendhil21_Integrating explanation and prediction in computational social science.pdf](file://file-bcdcqvtsjjvjjazu48zau2%23:~:text=much%20to%20test%20predictions%20at,zero,%20in%20the%20complex%20world/)). Similarly, classic econometric choice models yield precise choice probabilities and assume decision-makers maximize utility from the start ([1_Moshe24_Discrete choice analysis nested logit model.pdf](file://xn--file-ey7sthvoczkwjznqnybd7j%23:~:text=u%20t%20-xo5awg/)) ([1_Moshe24_Discrete choice analysis nested logit model.pdf](file://file-ey7sthvoczkwjznqnybd7j%23:~:text=p%20car%20car,%20redbus,%20bluebus,e/)).|
|bbaa|no|no|yes|yes|_No direct example (close to “heuristic planner” concept)_|**Heuristic Planner:** does not use formal scenario analysis or precise probabilities, but _does_ recognize thinking costs and delays utility focus. (Imagine an entrepreneur who uses rough heuristics, knows not to overthink due to time pressure, and initially just tries to gather information – a likely real-world style, though not explicitly profiled in our sources.)|
|**bbab**|no|no|yes|no|**Adaptive satisficer** – Bhui et al. (2021) ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=stochastic%20choice%20and%20perseveration%20even,same%20decision,%20our%20choices%20may/)) ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=rationality%20by%20conceiving%20of%20judgment,as%20optimal%20under/))|**Heuristic Decision-Maker:** forgoes explicit probability models and scenario simulations, but is _resource-rational_ (limits cognitive effort ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=rationality%20by%20conceiving%20of%20judgment,as%20optimal%20under/))) and ultimately does consider utility (though in a simplified way). Bhui et al.’s work recasts biases as this kind of rational adaptation – the person uses “good enough” judgments under constraints and then acts for gain (e.g. a founder relying on intuition and experience to make a quick profit-driven choice, aware of their mental limits).|
|bbba|no|no|no|yes|_No direct example_|**Deliberative Non-Utilitarian:** neither imaginary nor precise in analysis, ignores cost of analysis, and does not initially consider utility. (This could describe an indecisive tinkerer – someone perpetually exploring ideas in a fuzzy way without ever applying them or seeking payoff. Unsurprisingly, none of our exemplars advocate this unproductive style.)|
|bbbb|no|no|no|no|_No direct example_|**Pure Opportunist (resource-blind):** a style with none of Good’s rationality facets – no systematic scenario planning, no probabilistic rigor, no regard for thinking costs, and immediate leap to chasing utility. This _extreme_ “shoot from the hip” approach – an entrepreneur operating entirely on gut impulse for quick gain – is largely a strawman. Stevenson’s promoter is often _accused_ of this ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=it%20is%20the%20willingness%20to,this/)), but in practice successful entrepreneurs temper it. This fully _“resource-blind”_ style remains an outlier, if it exists at all in profiled research.|

From the typology above, we see that our eight source works cover only a subset of the possible styles (5 of 16 codes in bold). Notably, **no single work embodies the fully integrated `aaaa` style**, which would entail imaginative scenario analysis, rigorous probabilities, conscious stopping rules, and delayed utility integration all at once – this combination is perhaps an aspirational ideal for _resourcefully rational_ entrepreneurship. At the opposite extreme, the wholly unstructured `bbbb` style (no imaginary thinking, no probability, no cost-awareness, and no delay of utility) is not advocated in scholarly work – reinforcing that purely “opportunity without regard to anything” is more myth than best practice.

**Underexplored styles.** Several intermediate styles lack direct exemplars and present opportunities for further research. For instance, the `aaab` and `aabb` types (which integrate Bayesian-style scenario planning and precision _with_ an upfront utility focus) are scarcely documented – how might entrepreneurs use Bayesian reasoning _and then immediately pivot to decision optimality_ within the same process? Another interesting gap is `abab`: an entrepreneur who _vividly imagines scenarios and minds the cost of delay, yet jumps straight to utility decisions without precise probabilities_. This could correspond to effective “intuitive” strategists who sketch multiple what-if stories quickly and choose the one with the best apparent payoff – a plausible style not yet formally analyzed. Similarly, `bbaa` (heuristic planner) likely describes many real entrepreneurs who rely on gut feeling (no formal models) but are keenly aware of time/resource limits and delay committing resources until they learn enough. This style, while noted anecdotally, needs more rigorous study to understand how entrepreneurs successfully balance intuition with patience. Overall, the typology highlights that **most research has gravitated toward the corners** – fully Bayesian planners (`aaba`), theory-driven entrepreneurs (`abaa`), bounded-rational actors (`bbab`), etc. – leaving the **hybrid strategies** in between relatively underexplored. Filling in these gaps (e.g. studying entrepreneurs who mix formal analysis with real-time utility optimization, or those who use imaginative thinking but low-precision estimates) would enrich our understanding of decision-making under uncertainty.

## Visualizing the 16-Style Space and Domain Complementarities

Imagine a four-dimensional space (a hyper-cube) defined by our facets: one dimension for each binary facet (Imaginary vs. Not, Precise vs. Not, Cost-aware vs. Not, Utility-deferred vs. Not). Each scholarly work occupies one of the 16 corners of this space (its 4-letter code), and entire academic domains cover certain regions within this space. We can visualize a **matrix of subplots or a cube diagram**: for example, split the space by Cost-awareness and Utility-deferred (since these quasiutility facets relate to handling of constraints), and within each subspace plot the trade-off between using imaginative scenario reasoning and precision of probabilities.

In such a visualization, we would see **clusters for each domain**: Bayesian statistics papers cluster in the sector where **Imaginary=a, Precise=a** (the right-front face of the cube), but within a plane of no cost-awareness. Strategic management works cluster where **Imaginary=a, Cost-aware=a, Utility-deferred=a** (the top-left edge of the cube), but on the side of low precision. Cognitive science spans a region around **Cost-aware=a, Utility-deferred=a** with varying use of precision (often b) and little imaginary reasoning (b). We could mark each paper’s position (e.g., using different colored symbols for each domain) and draw ellipsoids or convex hulls encompassing the papers of a domain.

**Complementarities** become visible as overlapping or adjacent regions: for instance, the **strategic** cluster (e.g., `abaa`) and the **Bayesian** cluster (`aaba`) overlap in that both value imaginative modeling (facet1) and delaying immediate utility (facet4 = a), indicating a synergy in advocating _theory before action_. However, they differ on precision and cost facets, occupying complementary halves of that subspace. The **cognitive** cluster (e.g., `bbab`, `baaa`) overlaps with the strategic cluster on acknowledging costs and deferring utility (sharing facet3 and facet4 = a): both domains stress resource constraints as seen in the visualization by their alignment along the Cost-aware and Utility-deferred axes. Where they differ is the Imaginary facet – strategic scholars push further on that axis than cognitive ones. Meanwhile, the **Bayesian** and **cognitive** domains intersect on the precision axis in some cases: Ullman & Tenenbaum (`baaa`) sits not far from the Bayesian primer (`aaba`) along the Precise dimension, meaning both share formal probabilistic underpinnings except that the cognitive approach incorporates cost constraints. This suggests a complementarity where cognitive science adds a third dimension (cost) to the 2D Bayesian framework of prior/posterior.

In the visualization, we also spot **tensions** where domains occupy opposite ends of a dimension. For example, Bayesian vs. cognitive approaches conflict on the _Precision_ facet: the Bayesian points (a?) lie on the “sharp probability” end, while many cognitive points lie on the “qualitative/approximate” end. This is a gap to bridge – e.g. entrepreneurs might need to decide how precise their estimates really need to be. Another tension: Bayesian work (and to an extent cognitive models) largely ignore facet4 (utility-deferred = a for them, meaning they don’t incorporate utility early), whereas many real-world strategic decisions eventually must consider resource utility trade-offs. The **absence of domain points in certain quadrants** of the visualization (as noted in underexplored styles) highlights these tensions and gaps. For instance, few points appear in the quadrant of “Imaginary=a _and_ Cost-aware=a _and_ Precise=a” (no domain fully occupies the all-`a` corner), signaling an area where theory and practice could strive to meet – integrating all facets.

In summary, a mapping of academic domains onto the 16-style decision space would show that **each domain covers certain facets well and neglects others**. Entrepreneurs operate in the full four-dimensional space – they need imagination, some quantitative sense, awareness of constraints, and focus on payoff at different times. The visualization would thus illuminate how a **synthesis of domain insights is necessary**: by combining the Bayesian emphasis on evidence and hypothesis-testing ([4_Andrew21_Holes in Bayesian statistics.pdf](file://file-ptqjeq4chkhpj5jvsgptx4%23:~:text=to%20be%20more%20constructive,%20in,this%20revelation%20of/)), the cognitive emphasis on adaptive simplicity ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=stochastic%20choice%20and%20perseveration%20even,same%20decision,%20our%20choices%20may/)) ([3_Rahul21_Resource rational decision making.pdf](file://file-rwwtvps5fdbeadmsh5ad2r%23:~:text=rationality%20by%20conceiving%20of%20judgment,as%20optimal%20under/)), and the strategic emphasis on timing and context ([4_Stevenson83_Perspective on entrepreneurship.pdf](file://file-rbrnkmqpkqqmnd5r83hqzv%23:~:text=the%20promoter%20is%20a%20person,are%20stationary;%20once%20there,%20they/)) ([3_Arnaldo24_Theory-driven strategic management decisions.pdf](file://file-xaabmegrnqujba8etacwe7%23:~:text=stopping%20time%20when%20decision%20makers,discounted,%20decision%20makers%20stop%20experimenting/)), we move closer to the coveted `aaaa` corner – a style of entrepreneurial decision-making that is both opportunity-driven _and_ resourcefully rational.
