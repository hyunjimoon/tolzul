| Tools–Needs | • 🐢 Need 1: Information-constrained opportunity valuation — A Bayesian model of how entrepreneurs allocate limited information-processing capacity when forming subjective beliefs about opportunities. (vs. behavioral-bias accounts)<br>• 🐢 Need 2: Market-driven belief evolution — A resource-rational framework explaining how entrepreneurs update beliefs from limited market signals without full convergence to consensus. (vs. shared-prior assumptions in game theory) | • 👾 Tool 1: Utility-based frameworks — A language from control and decision theory (e.g., partially observable Markov decision processes) to formalize agents’ decisions assuming infinite computational capacity.<br>• 👾 Tool 2: Resource-rational inference algorithms — Algorithms enabling optimal decisions under computational constraints using limited samples.<br>• 👾 Tool 3: Probabilistic programming platforms — Language, algorithms, and community that integrate utility and resource-rational inference in unified computational architectures. |
