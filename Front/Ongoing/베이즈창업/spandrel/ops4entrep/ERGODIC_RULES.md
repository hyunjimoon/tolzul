# 🎯 Ergodic File System Rules

## Core Principle: Time Average = Ensemble Average

### 1. The Daily Touch Rule
Each day, create or modify at least one file in your **assigned chain**:

```bash
# Morning ritual
1. Run ./ergodic_sampler.sh
2. Get your chain assignment
3. Create/modify at least one file there
4. Update CHAIN_TRACKER.md
```

### 2. The Chain Token System

Create "token" files to track activity:
```
1_🐢acculturate-evaluate/
  └── 📅2025-08-07-explored-X.md
  
2_🐅evaluate-professionalize.../
  └── 📅2025-08-07-systematized-Y.md
  
3_🐙collaborate-automate.../
  └── 📅2025-08-07-executed-Z.md
  
4_👾segment-replicate.../
  └── 📅2025-08-07-user-feedback-A.md
```

### 3. The Forced Transition Protocol

**Every 3 days**, you MUST transition chains:
```
Current Chain → Next Chain (forced)
🐢 → 🐅 (validate something)
🐅 → 🐙 (execute something)
🐙 → 👾 (get user feedback)
👾 → 🐢 (new experiment from user insight)
```

### 4. The Diagnostic Ritual

**Every Friday**, calculate your R-hat:
1. Count files modified in each chain
2. Calculate percentage of time in each
3. If any chain R-hat > 1.5, spend entire next week there

### 5. The Ergodic Constraints

**File Naming Convention**:
```
[DATE]-[CHAIN]-[ACTION]-[TOPIC].md

Examples:
2025-08-07-CAN-experiment-joker-balance.md
2025-08-07-DEV-systematize-chain-tracker.md
2025-08-07-FILL-execute-user-workshop.md
2025-08-07-USE-feedback-startup-needs.md
```

### 6. The Cross-Chain Links

Every file should link to potential next chains:
```markdown
# Current: 🐢 Experiment on X

## Next Chains:
- 🐅 If validated: [Create process doc here]
- 🐙 If ready to test: [Create execution plan here]
- 👾 If need user input: [Create feedback form here]
```

### 7. The Emergency Rebalance

If weekly R-hat > 2.0 for any chain:
1. **STOP** all other chains
2. Spend 3 days in neglected chain
3. Create "Chain Recovery Log"
4. Document what prevented visits

### 8. The Ensemble Average Template

What would a complete entrepreneur do weekly?
- 2-3 days: Experimenting (🐢)
- 2 days: Building systems (🐅)
- 2 days: Executing/collaborating (🐙)
- 1-2 days: User research (👾)

**Your file system should reflect this distribution!**

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Install ergodic_sampler.sh
- [ ] Print CHAIN_TRACKER.md 
- [ ] Set daily reminder for chain assignment
- [ ] Create first token file in each chain
- [ ] Calculate baseline R-hat

Remember: **An ergodic life requires ergodic files!**
