| What to offer?    | Collaborate, Automate, Platformize | [[paper]], [[teaching]]              | archive  |
| Who am I?         | Acculturate, Evaluate              | [[toltol]], [[zulzul]]               | project  |
| Who am I serving? | Segment, Replicate                 | [[professor]], [[student]]           | area     |

1_🐢 ACCULTURATE-EVALUATE: Who you're becoming  
2_👾 SEGMENT-REPLICATE-CAPITALIZE: Who you're serving  
3_🐅 PROFESSIONALIZE-PROCESSIFY: How you're operating  
4_🐙 COLLABORATE-AUTOMATE-PLATFORMIZE: What you're producing  

using this structure i intend to architect my paper as 🐙educate, 🐢theorize, 🐅synthesize, 👾apply. i can leverage the disciplined structure of 🐙introduction, 🐢literature review, 🐅methodology, 👾discussion for each.

model 1 to 2: entrepreneurs has freedom to promise
model 2 to 3: entrepreneurs overpromise by missing sell vs deliver tradeoff
model 3 to 4: entrepreneurs promise by missing learn vs keep promise tradeoff
model 4 to 5: entrepreneurs share ambition to flexibly keep promise

## Joker Framework
- **Exploit** (low variance): Optimize existing chains
- **Explore** (high variance): Create new value flows

## Weekly Balance Check
| Chain | Target | R-hat Check |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐢 | 30% | Balancing ⚡speed & 🧲depth? |
| 👾 | 20% | Understanding user needs? |
| 🐅 | 25% | Strengthening core operations? |
| 🐙 | 25% | Creating valuable outputs? |

**R-hat** = max(actual%/target%, target%/actual%)  
✅ < 1.1 | ⚠️ 1.1-1.5 | ❌ > 1.5
