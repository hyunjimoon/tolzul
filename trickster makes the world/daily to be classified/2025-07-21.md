- defense tech exploding

self introduction
simplify into bayesian entreprneurship (mens) et operations (manus)

• **Who I am**: Angie Moon - I see operations through a Bayesian lens (everything is a random variable → uncertainty pooling + flexibility)

• **What I've done**: Matched capabilities to customers

- Demand prediction for logistics companies
- Lifecycle weapon systems for defense agencies

• **How I think**: Connect needs with solutions

- Time series prediction using hierarchical Bayes
- Help entrepreneurs propose value to vendors

• **Core belief**: Operations = creating value by linking capability, product, and customer

• **Why Bayes matters**: Gives us pooling and flexibility to make decisions under uncertainty - whether managing inventory or defense systems
