# 1.ğŸŒ±-ğŸŒ¿ NAIL Value Discovery

**Mission**: "Carry as little as possible but choose that little with care"

## 1.1ğŸŒ±-ğŸŒ¿ writing guide
1. ğŸŸª **S1â†”S23: - Articulate a fundamental challenge or failure point for entrepreneurs in business. Then, consider how this challenge evolves or is exacerbated in a dynamic, rapidly changing market environment.
2. ğŸŸ¥ **S9â†”S31**: Identify a key strategic lever or principle that addresses the core problem. Subsequently, think about how this solution needs to adapt or change to remain effective in that same dynamic market context.
3. **Build need-solution architecture** (ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ S3-8):
    - ğŸŸ© S3-4: Two fundamental needs
    - ğŸŸ§ S5-6: Two solution approaches

## 1.2ğŸŒ±-ğŸŒ¿ example
- ğŸŸª **S1â†”S23**: "Entrepreneurs fail when commitments mismatch" â†” "Dynamic markets destabilize commitments"
- ğŸŸ¥ **S9â†”S31**: "Optimal quality minimizes mismatch cost" â†” "Adaptive quality tracks evolving commitments"
- ğŸŸ© **S3-4**: Forecast commitments; Prescribe quality
- ğŸŸ§ **S5-6**: Choice-based forecasting; Newsvendor prescription

## 1.3ğŸŒ±-ğŸŒ¿ environment
 - **Stakeholder Focus**: Identify key academic "customers" (target journals, research communities)
- **Dilemmas**: Theory push vs. literature pull
- **Key Output**: Minimum Viable Paper (MVP) - Core argument crystallized
- **Speed over perfection**: Get core ideas down quickly
- **Experimentation mindset**: Test different problem-solution combinations
- **Customer intimacy**: Focus on specific reader needs
- **Pivoting readiness**: Willing to change S3-8 if S1-2 or S9-10 shift

## 1.4ğŸŒ±-ğŸŒ¿ test 
Can you explain your paper's value in 2 minutes to a non-expert? (customer intimacy and finding product-market fit)

# 2.ğŸŒ¿-ğŸŒ¾ SCALE Architecture Building 
## 2.1 ğŸŒ¿-ğŸŒ¾ writing guide

1. ğŸŸ§ S11-16: Problem formulation (begin integration)
2. ğŸŸ© S17-22: Core finding (integration result)
3. ğŸŸª **S2â†”S24**: Counter-example â†” Complexity not addressed
4. ğŸŸ¨ **S3â†”S25**: Literature gap â†” Literature extension
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Engage "resource partners" (reviewers, methodological experts)
- **Process Tools**:
    - Processification: Standardize argument flow
    - Professionalization: Add disciplinary rigor
    - Segmentation: Target specific academic audiences

## 2.2ğŸŒ¿-ğŸŒ¾ example
- ğŸŸ§ S11-16: Model inputs (quality choices), process (how quality maps to each stakeholder's commitment function), outputs (expected mismatch cost)
- ğŸŸ© S17-22: Results showing optimal quality balances stakeholder commitments, minimizing mismatch costs

## 2.3ğŸŒ¿-ğŸŒ¾ environment
- **Processification**: Systematic model building (S11-16)
- **Professionalization**: Rigorous results (S17-22)
- **Segmentation**: Different implications for different audiences
- **Quality focus**: Every detail must work

## 2.4ğŸŒ¿-ğŸŒ¾ test
Does every sentence add unique value to the architecture? (professionalization)

# 3.ğŸŒ¾-ğŸŒ² SAIL Impact Optimization 
**Mission**: "Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm!"

## 3.1ğŸŒ¾-ğŸŒ²writing guide
1. **Identify extended phenomena** (ğŸŸª S24): What remains unsolved? 
2. **Build extended architecture** (ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ¦ S25-30):
		- ğŸŸ© S25-26: New emerging needs
		- ğŸŸ§ S27-28: Extended solutions
		- ğŸŸ¦ S29-30: Advanced integration

3. **Synthesize impact** (ğŸŸ¥ 32): Future vision
## 3.2ğŸŒ¾-ğŸŒ² example

- ğŸŸª S24: Dynamic markets require adaptive quality
- ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ¦ S25-30: Extended framework for time-varying optimization
- ğŸŸ¥ S32: Vision for automated entrepreneurial decision systems

## 3.3ğŸŒ¾-ğŸŒ² environment
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Maximize value for "customers" (readers, citers)
- **Ambidextrous thinking**: Complete current work while enabling future research
- **System perspective**: See beyond immediate contribution
- **Platform building**: Create foundation others can build on
- **Stability with exploration**: Maintain quality while pushing boundaries

## 3.4ğŸŒ¾-ğŸŒ² test 
Does your paper enable future research?

# summary

through three stage process:
ğŸŒ±2**ğŸŒ¿ 
- ğŸŸª S1â†”S23 (phenomenon symmetry)
- ğŸŸ¥ S9â†”S31 (contribution symmetry)

**ğŸŒ¿2**ğŸŒ¾ 
- ğŸŸ§ S11 â†’ ğŸŸ© S17 (problemâ†’finding flow)
- ğŸŸª S2â†”S24 (examples)
- ğŸŸ¨ S3â†”S25 (literature positioning)

**ğŸŒ¾2ğŸŒ²
- ğŸŸ¨ S4-S8â†”S26-S30 (full literature architecture)
- ğŸŸ§ S12-S16 (methods elaboration)
- ğŸŸ© S18-S22 (results elaboration)
- ğŸŸ¥ S10â†”S32 (vision expansion)

the final paper product should be:
- **Module 1** ğŸŸªğŸŸª (S1-2): Phenomenon identification
- **Module 2** ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ (S3-8): Need-solution pairs
- **Module 3** ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ (S9-10): Core contribution
- **Module 4** ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ (S11-16): Usable model
- **Module 5** ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ© (S17-22): Useful results
- **Module 6** ğŸŸªğŸŸª (S23-24): Extended phenomena
- **Module 7** ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ (S25-30): Extended need-solution pairs
- **Module 8** ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ (S31-32): Synthesis & conclusion


make sure three stages possess **Vertical symmetry**: Modules 1â†”6, 2â†”7, 3â†”8, **Progressive depth**: Each stage doubles content (4â†’8â†’16 sentences, **Color consistency**: Similar functions use similar colors across stages. color code (ğŸŸª phenomena, ğŸŸ¨ literature, ğŸŸ¥ contribution, ğŸŸ§ methods, ğŸŸ© results) build upon each other through the three stages of paper development.
