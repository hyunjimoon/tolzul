# 🧬⚙️(📝) - Double Helix Paper Construction Framework

## MSS(🫀: Academic Paper Development, markovian(🧠))

### Current State (Sₜ)
- Paper structure: Perfect double helix symmetry
- Four development stages: 🌱(4)→🌿(8)→🌳(16)→🌲(32)
- Current stage: [DETECT FROM CONTEXT]
- Sentences written: [DETECT FROM CONTEXT]

### Color-Coded Sentence Allocation

**Introduction (10 sentences)**
  * 🟣 1.1 Phenomenon: [🟣1, 🟣2] ↔ mirrors 4.1
  * 🟨 1.2 Literature Review: [🟨3, 🟨4, 🟨5, 🟨6, 🟨7, 🟨8] ↔ mirrors 4.2  
  * 🔴 1.3 Contribution: [🔴9, 🔴10] ↔ mirrors 4.3

**Methods (6 sentences)**
  * 🟧 2.1 Strategic Approach: [🟧11, 🟧12, 🟧13]
  * 🟧 2.2 Operational Approach: [🟧14, 🟧15, 🟧16]

**Results (6 sentences)**
  * 🟢 3.1 Key Findings: [🟢17, 🟢18, 🟢19]
  * 🟢 3.2 Case Insights: [🟢20, 🟢21, 🟢22]

**Discussion (10 sentences)**
  * 🟣 4.1 Unsolved Problems: [🟣23, 🟣24] ↔ mirrors 1.1
  * 🟨 4.2 Extensions: [🟨25, 🟨26, 🟨27, 🟨28, 🟨29, 🟨30] ↔ mirrors 1.2
  * 🔴 4.3 Enable Next Cycle: [🔴31, 🔴32] ↔ mirrors 1.3

### Stage Progression Guide (Doubling Pattern: 4→8→16→32)

#### 🌱 Stage 1: Core Skeleton (4 sentences)
**Goal**: Establish problem↔solution symmetry
**Write these sentences**:
```yaml
- 🟣1: Industry failure case (phenomenon start)
- 🔴9: Core contribution statement
- 🟣23: Model's main limitation (mirrors 🟣1)
- 🔴31: Synthesis of contribution's impact (mirrors 🔴9)
````

**Why**: Creates immediate problem→solution→limitation→synthesis arc

#### 🌿 Stage 2: Double to 8 sentences (+4)

**Goal**: Add one key element per major section **From 🌱(4), add**:

yaml

```yaml
- 🟣2: Success counter-example
- 🟨3: CS - Strategic cause from literature
- 🟧11: Problem formulation (strategic)
- 🟢17: Core finding statement
```

**Why**: Adds depth to phenomenon + initiates each methodological section

#### 🌳 Stage 3: Double to 16 sentences (+8)

**Goal**: Complete structural symmetry **From 🌿(8), add**:

yaml

```yaml
- 🟨5: SS - Strategic solution from literature
- 🟨7: CO - Operational cause from literature
- 🔴10: Broader impact statement
- 🟧14: Cost structure (operational)
- 🟢20: First case application
- 🟣24: Complexity not addressed (mirrors 🟣2)
- 🟨25: CS Extension (mirrors 🟨3)
- 🔴32: Forward vision
```

**Why**: Achieves complete left-right helix symmetry

#### 🌲 Stage 4: Double to 32 sentences (+16)

**Goal**: Fill all remaining sentences with full depth **From 🌳(16), add all remaining**:

yaml

```yaml
Introduction: 🟨4, 🟨6, 🟨8
Methods: 🟧12, 🟧13, 🟧15, 🟧16
Results: 🟢18, 🟢19, 🟢21, 🟢22
Discussion: 🟨26, 🟨27, 🟨28, 🟨29, 🟨30
```

**Why**: Completes full technical and empirical detail

### Sentence Templates (Key Examples)

**🟣 Phenomenon ↔ Unsolved (Violet)**

- 🟣1: "Company X built Y before Z, resulting in [failure]"
- 🟣23: "Our model assumes [X], yet cannot capture [Y]"

**🟨 Literature ↔ Extensions (Yellow)**

- 🟨3: "Prior work on [CS] shows [finding] (Author, Year)"
- 🟨25: "Future models could incorporate [CS enhancement]"

**🔴 Contribution ↔ Next Cycle (Red)**

- 🔴9: "We develop [specific model/framework] that [capability]"
- 🔴31: "By solving [problem], we enable [future possibility]"

**🟧 Methods (Orange)**

- 🟧11: "We formulate the problem as: [mathematical notation]"
- 🟧14: "The objective function minimizes: [cost structure]"

**🟢 Results (Green)**

- 🟢17: "Our analysis reveals [optimal policy] under [conditions]"
- 🟢20: "Applying to [Company], we find [specific insight]"

### Analysis Examples
- [[🌲2🌱halving🧬(yoo16)]]
### Current Session Quick Check

python

```python
def session_status(written_sentences):
    total = len(written_sentences)
    if total <= 4:
        stage = "🌱"
        next_target = 8
        priority = "Add 🟣2, 🟨3, 🟧11, 🟢17"
    elif total <= 8:
        stage = "🌿"
        next_target = 16
        priority = "Complete symmetry pairs"
    elif total <= 16:
        stage = "🌳"
        next_target = 32
        priority = "Fill technical depth"
    else:
        stage = "🌲"
        next_target = "Complete!"
        priority = "Polish and refine"
    
    return f"Stage: {stage} ({total}/32) → Target: {next_target}"
```

### Writing Rules

1. **Symmetry First**: Always maintain left↔right helix mirrors
2. **Color Balance**: Each stage should add multiple colors
3. **Doubling Pattern**: 4→8→16→32 (never skip stages)
4. **Coherent Flow**: Each sentence must connect to adjacent IDs

### Stopping Rule for Model Development

**When to stop adding model complexity in one paper:**

```
IF (CS + SS + CO + SO addressed) AND
   (3+ limitations identified) AND
   (validation shows clear value)
THEN stop_model = true
```

Leave remaining complexity for 4.2 Extensions (🟨25-30).
