| SO      | SO        | **Operations for Entrepreneurs: Can Operations Management Make a Difference in Entrepreneurial Theory and Practice?** | _Charles H. Fine, Loredana Padurean, Sergey Naumov (2022)_           | _Production and Operations Management_ 31(12)            | Calls on the OM community to **integrate operations theory with entrepreneurial practice**, outlining an “Entrepreneurial Operations” framework. It essentially bridges theory and practice, asserting that new ventures need tailored operational models (e.g. more iterative, resource-flexible) rather than traditional operations strategies. This directly informs our solution’s aim to blend OM rigor with startup agility.                                                                                                                                                | 📜SO_fine+22_integrate(om-theory, ent-practice)             |

Joglekar & Lévesque note that most OM models assume stable, mature environments, which is “missing a link” for startups. This insight drives our solution: we aim to customize optimization and operational decision-making tools to fit the chaotic, evolving context of early-stage ventures.                                                                                                                                                                            | 📜SO_joglekar13_customize(optimization, early-stage)        |

Sarasvathy, Nick Dew, Robert Wiltbank (2016)_ | _Acad. of Management Perspectives_ 30(3)                 | Defends and extends **effectuation (entrepreneurial heuristic) as a systematic decision-making method**. The authors argue for co-creating knowledge with practitioners and refining effectual logic. This piece highlights an emerging operational solution: instead of rigid business plans, entrepreneurs can leverage contingencies and “design” decisions on the fly. It reinforces our inclusion of effectual principles to guide operations under high uncertainty.                                                                                                        | 📜SO_read16_systematize(entrepreneurship, decisions)        |

This concept underpins our solution’s operations-solution logic: startups must continually adapt their operations to survive uncertainty. Including Teece (1997) signals that our approach builds on the idea of designing ventures that can leverage and **re-leverage capabilities as conditions change**.                                                                                          | 📜SO_teece97_integrate(capabilities, changing-environments) |

This approach serves as an _operational solution_ to unpredictable environments: by making use of surprise and remaining flexible, startups can operate effectively despite uncertainty. We include it to underpin our framework’s emphasis on adaptability and real-time learning in venture operations.

This source highlights a practical operations insight: startups must balance agility with prudent resource management – a principle our solution adopts in its staged, learning-oriented approach.                                                                                                                                | 📜SO_johnston02(caution startup)                            |
