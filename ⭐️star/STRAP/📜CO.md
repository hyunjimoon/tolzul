## CO – Cause-Operations (Operational Execution Gaps)

|CO|CO|**Operations for Entrepreneurs: Can Operations Management Make a Difference in Entrepreneurial Theory and Practice?**|_Sergey Naumov, John D. Sterman, David R. Keith (2022)_|_Production and Operations Management_ 31(12)|Argues that startups have **unique operational needs** compared to large firms and that traditional OM tools don’t directly apply. They propose adapting OM frameworks to the startup context (“operations for entrepreneurs”), highlighting an operational cause of failure: early ventures lack tailored processes. This justifies our agenda to bridge OM principles with entrepreneurial practice.|📜CO_naumov22_adapt(om-tools, startup-context)|
|CO|CO|**A Scientific Approach to Entrepreneurial Decision Making: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial**|_Alberto Camuffo, Alessandro Cordova, Alfonso Gambardella, Chiara Spina (2020)_|_Management Science_ 66(2)|Demonstrates that entrepreneurs who followed a **structured, hypothesis-driven operational process (Lean Startup method)** achieved higher pivoting success and learning than those with ad-hoc approaches. This indicates an execution gap: without systematic experimentation, startups operate inefficiently. It provides causal evidence that improving operational rigor (the problem our work tackles) can significantly boost venture outcomes.|📜CO_brinckmann19_adapt(om-tools, startup-context)|
