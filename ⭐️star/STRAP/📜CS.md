## CS – Cause-Strategy (Cognitive/Strategic Causes)

|Cluster|Five-Area|Full Title|Authors (Year)|Journal / Source|Key Reason for Inclusion|Filename|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|CS|CS|**Causation and Effectuation: Toward a Theoretical Shift from Economic Inevitability to Entrepreneurial Contingency**|_Saras D. Sarasvathy (2001)_|_Acad. of Management Review_ 26(2)|Introduces _effectuation theory_, showing that entrepreneurs often **use iterative, non-predictive strategies under uncertainty** instead of classic planning. This suggests cognitive causes for venture outcomes: rigid “causation” logic vs. flexible, contingency-based thinking – highlighting a strategic mindset gap our solution will address.|📜CS_sarasvathy01_bridge(causation, effectuation)|
|CS|CS|**Startup Metrics That Tech Entrepreneurs Need to Know**|_Kai-Kristian Kemell, Xiaofeng Wang, Anh Nguyen-Duc, et al. (2020)_|In _Fundamentals of Software Startups_ (Springer)|Identifies **118 metrics** important for software startups, highlighting that entrepreneurs often lack or misidentify the right performance measures. This implies a strategic cause: without the right metrics, founders make biased decisions. It underscores the need for better guidance on what to measure (a gap our work can fill with cognitive decision support).|📜CS_kemell20_identify(metrics, startups)|
|CS|CS|**Discovery and Creation: Alternative Theories of Entrepreneurial Action**|_Sharon A. Alvarez, Jay B. Barney (2007)_|_Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal_ 1(1)|Distinguishes **“discovery” opportunities (pre-existing) vs. “creation” opportunities (enacted)** in entrepreneurship. This theoretical divide indicates a strategic-cognitive cause: entrepreneurs who only search for discovered ideas may miss created ones. It highlights the need to bridge both views, aligning with our aim to incorporate different opportunity logics in strategy.|📜CS_alvarez07_bridge(discovery, creation)|
|CS|CS|**Entrepreneurial Action and the Role of Uncertainty in the Theory of the Entrepreneur**|_Jeffrey S. McMullen, Dean A. Shepherd (2006)_|_Acad. of Management Review_ 31(1)|Proposes a model that an entrepreneur’s **action depends on their perceived uncertainty and willingness to bear it**. It pinpoints a cognitive cause of strategic failure: if uncertainty is misperceived or not handled, entrepreneurs may not act when they should (or act blindly when they shouldn’t). This underscores the need for frameworks (like ours) that help founders better handle uncertainty in decision-making.|📜CS_mcmullen06_handle(uncertainty, action)|
|CS|CS|**How Does Information Overload Affect Consumers’ Online Decision Process? An Event-Related Potentials Study**|_Minjing Peng, Zhicheng Xu, Haiyang Huang (2021)_|_Frontiers in Neuroscience_ 15|Demonstrates that **information overload impairs decision quality** and induces decision regret. By analogy, startup founders often face information overload (e.g. too much feedback or data), leading to strategic misjudgments. This highlights a cognitive cause – human limits in processing complex information – suggesting our solution should streamline and prioritize information for better entrepreneurial decisions.|📜CS_peng21_overload(information, decisions)|
|CS|CS|**Programs of Experimentation and Pivoting for (Overconfident) Entrepreneurs**|_John S. Chen, Daniel W. Elfenbein, Hart E. Posen, Ming Z. Wang (2022)_|_Acad. of Management Review_ 47(4) (Forthcoming)|Uses simulation to show that a well-designed **program of experiments can mitigate entrepreneurs’ overconfidence bias**. Overconfident entrepreneurs often make poor strategic choices; this work implies a solution: structured experimentation (with aggressive pivot thresholds) helps _de-bias_ founders. It supports our effort to incorporate decision-support tools that counter cognitive biases in entrepreneurial strategy.|📜CS_chen22_debias(entrepreneurs, overconfidence)|
