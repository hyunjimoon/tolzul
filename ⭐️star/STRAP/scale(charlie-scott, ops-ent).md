# Master Plan: Scaling from Charlie-Scott to Angie

## Phase 1: Beachhead with Charlie-Scott Evangelists

**Target**: MIT/Stanford entrepreneurship programs

- **Charlie's Role**: Teach operational stages (Nail/Scale/Sail)
- **Scott's Role**: Teach strategic choices (4 strategies × uncertainty)
- **Integration**: Show stage-strategy optimal mapping

## Phase 2: Simplification for Angie

Transform academic framework into practitioner-friendly version:

### From Charlie-Scott → Angie Translation

|**Academic Version**|**Angie Version**|**One-Line Wisdom**|
|---|---|---|
|Nail + Disruptor + Statistical Uncertainty|**"Test Fast, Fail Cheap"**|Try 10 things quickly, keep what works|
|Scale + Value Chain + Approximation Error|**"Build the Machine"**|Turn chaos into repeatable processes|
|Sail + Architectural + Optimization|**"Own the System"**|Control the whole game, not just pieces|

### Simplified Decision Tree for Angie

```
Q1: Do your customers exist yet?
├─ No → You're NAILING (be a Disruptor)
│       Use: Cheap experiments, talk to everyone
└─ Yes → Q2: Is your business repeatable?
         ├─ No → You're SCALING (be a Value Chain)
         │       Use: Charlie's 10 tools, hire specialists
         └─ Yes → You're SAILING (be Architectural)
                 Use: Optimize everything, defend position
```

## Phase 3: Mass Market Rollout

### Three-Rule Framework for Angie

1. **Match Your Stage**: Where you are determines what strategy works
2. **Use Right Tools**: Different stages need different tools (machete → swiss army → navigation)
3. **Watch Your Clock**: Move fast when uncertain, slow down when clear

### Success Metrics

- **Beachhead** (Charlie-Scott): Deep understanding, academic rigor
- **Early Mainstream** (Simplified): 80% comprehension, practical application
- **Mass Market** (Angie): 3 memorable rules, immediate action

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Months 1-6**: Test with 100 academic entrepreneurs
2. **Months 7-12**: Simplify based on feedback, test with 1,000 practitioners
3. **Year 2**: Launch "3 Rules for Startup Success" mass market campaign

## Key Insight

The min-cost max-flow framework naturally simplifies: optimal paths become rules of thumb, academic precision becomes practical wisdom, and Charlie-Scott's expertise becomes Angie's intuition.
