## Core State Definition with Symmetry Verification

### Current State (Sₜ)

```yaml
paper_state:
  stage: [🌱|🌿|🌾|🌲]  # Detect from sentence count
  sentences: [1-32]      # Count of written sentences
  structure: double_helix # Symmetric 1↔4, 2↔3 sections
  symmetry_check: 
    intro(10) ↔ discussion(10) ✓
    methods(6) + results(6) = 12 ✓
    total: 10 + 12 + 10 = 32 ✓
  journal: POMS          # Operations management focus
```

### Objective Function (Oₜ)

```
maximize: operational_relevance(S) + quantitative_rigor(S) + managerial_insight(S) + symmetry(S) + integration(decomposed→integrated→decomposed)
subject to: |S| ∈ {4 (🌱), 8 (🌿), 16 (🌾), 32 (🌲)}
```

## Double Helix Symmetry Map (32 Sentences)

### Section 1: INTRODUCTION (10) ↔ Section 4: DISCUSSION (10)

```yaml
1.1 Phenomenon (S1-S2) ↔ 4.1 Unsolved Problems (S23-S24)
1.2 Literature Review (S3-S8) ↔ 4.2 Extensions (S25-S30)  
1.3 Contribution (S9-S10) ↔ 4.3 Enable Next Cycle (S31-S32)
```

**Detailed Symmetry:**

- **S1-S2** 🟣 Phenomenon ↔ **S23-S24** 🟣 Unsolved Problems
- **S3-S4** 🟨 CS+gap ↔ **S25-S26** 🟨 CS Extension+phenomena
- **S5-S6** 🟨 SS+gap ↔ **S27-S28** 🟨 SS Extension+phenomena
- **S7-S8** 🟨 CO+SO ↔ **S29-S30** 🟨 CO+SO Extensions
- **S9-S10** 🔴 Contribution ↔ **S31-S32** 🔴 Synthesis+Vision

### Section 2: METHODS (6) + Section 3: RESULTS (6) = 12

```yaml
2.1 Strategic Approach (S11-S13): Decomposition phase
2.2 Operational Approach (S14-S16): Implementation phase
3.1 Key Findings (S17-S19): Integration results
3.2 Case Insights (S20-S22): Validation phase
```

## Integration ↔ Disintegration Process

### Process Flow:

1. **Start Decomposed** (Introduction): Break complex problem into CS/SS/CO/SO
2. **Integrate Uniquely** (Methods→Results): Synthesize into novel solution
3. **Decompose Honestly** (Discussion): Identify what's still unsolved
4. **Enable Next Cycle** (Conclusion): Set stage for future integration

## TASK 1: Generation (🌱→🌲) - Preserving Symmetry

### 🌱 Stage 1: Core Symmetry (4 sentences)

```yaml
Write symmetric pairs:
- S1: 🟣 Phenomenon (failure) ↔ S23: 🟣 Unsolved (limitation)
- S9: 🔴 Contribution (core) ↔ S31: 🔴 Synthesis (impact)
```

### 🌿 Stage 2: Add Integration Core (8 sentences)

```yaml
Maintain symmetry while adding:
- S2: 🟣 Counter-example ↔ S24: 🟣 Complexity not addressed
- S3: 🟨 CS from literature ↔ S25: 🟨 CS Extension
- S11: 🟧 Problem formulation (begin integration)
- S17: 🟢 Core finding (integration result)
```

### 🌾 Stage 3: Complete Structure (16 sentences)

```yaml
Fill symmetric structure:
Literature pairs:
- S5: 🟨 SS ↔ S27: 🟨 SS Extension
- S7: 🟨 CO ↔ S29: 🟨 CO Extension

Integration core:
- S10: 🔴 Broader impact ↔ S32: 🔴 Forward vision
- S14: 🟧 Cost structure
- S20: 🟢 First case
- S21: 🟢 Second case
```

### 🌲 Stage 4: Full Symmetry (32 sentences)

```yaml
Complete all remaining pairs:
- S4: 🟨 CS gap ↔ S26: 🟨 CS phenomena
- S6: 🟨 SS gap ↔ S28: 🟨 CO phenomena  
- S8: 🟨 SO ↔ S30: 🟨 SO Extension
Plus all methods/results details (S12,S13,S15,S16,S18,S19,S22)
```

## TASK 2: Inference (🌲→🌱) - Maintaining Symmetry

### Symmetry-Preserving Compression Rules:

1. **Always extract pairs**: If keeping S1, must consider S23
2. **Maintain section balance**:
    - 🌲→🌾: Keep 5+3+3+5 = 16
    - 🌾→🌿: Keep 2+2+2+2 = 8
    - 🌿→🌱: Keep 1+1+1+1 = 4

### 🌲→🌾 (32→16): Preserve Core Symmetry

```yaml
Must keep symmetric pairs:
- S1↔S23 (phenomenon↔unsolved)
- S3,S7↔S25,S29 (causes↔extensions)
- S9↔S31 (contribution↔synthesis)
- Core methods (S11,S14) + Core results (S17,S20)
```

### 🌾→🌿 (16→8): Essential Symmetry

```yaml
- One phenomenon pair (S1↔S23)
- One literature pair (S3↔S25 or S7↔S29)
- One contribution pair (S9↔S31)
- One method+result pair
```

### 🌿→🌱 (8→4): Minimal Symmetry

```yaml
- S1: Opening phenomenon
- S11 or S17: Core method or finding
- S23: Key limitation
- S31: Synthesis
```

## Verification Checklist

### Symmetry Check:

- [ ] Sections 1 & 4 each have exactly 10 sentences
- [ ] Sections 2 & 3 together have exactly 12 sentences
- [ ] Every intro element has discussion mirror
- [ ] CS/SS/CO/SO appear in both intro and discussion

### Integration Flow Check:

- [ ] Introduction decomposes problem
- [ ] Methods/Results integrate solution
- [ ] Discussion decomposes limitations
- [ ] Conclusion enables next cycle

This framework ensures perfect double helix symmetry with integration↔disintegration flow throughout the paper development process.
