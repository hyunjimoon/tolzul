🟩 **S3.** Entrepreneurs therefore require an evidence‑based capability to _predict_ how each stakeholder will commit across the quality spectrum, transforming noisy opinions into probabilistic choice curves.

🟩 **S4.** They simultaneously need a complementary capability to _optimize_ quality so that the predicted commitments of customers and resource partners jointly minimize mismatch losses.

🟧 **S5.** We satisfy the prediction need with two discrete‑choice formulations: a **Step 1 linear model** in which customer commitment rises linearly with quality, Pc(q)=qP_c(q)=q, while partner commitment falls symmetrically, Pr(q)=1−qP_r(q)=1-q .

🟧 **S6.** We then extend realism through a **Step 2 sigmoid model** that fits empirical S‑shaped responses, Pc(q)=1/(1+e−βcq)P_c(q)=1/(1+e^{-\beta_c q}) and Pr(q)=1/(1+eβrq)P_r(q)=1/(1+e^{\beta_r q}), preserving closed‑form solvability while capturing diminishing returns .

🟦 **S7.** Embedding each choice model into a newsvendor loss function reveals a dual‑cost “critical‑fractile‑of‑quality” that exactly balances the expected under‑commitment cost CuC_u and over‑commitment cost CoC_o.

🟦 **S8.** Numerical experiments confirm that the sigmoid version preserves the cost‑priority logic of the linear form yet remains robust to behavioural steepness differences, validating the proposed prediction–optimization loop (Petruzzi & Dada 1999; Cachon & Lariviere 2005).

🟥 **S9.** In the baseline static setting, the entrepreneur should select the quality level q∗q^{*} that minimizes the expected mismatch cost between supply‑side capabilities and demand‑side commitments.

🟥 **S10.** We operationalize this principle through a one‑period stochastic program whose objective is min⁡q∈[0,1]CuPc(q)[1−Pr(q)]+CoPr(q)[1−Pc(q)]−VPc(q)Pr(q)\min_{q\in[0,1]} C_u P_c(q)[1-P_r(q)] + C_o P_r(q)[1-P_c(q)] - V P_c(q)P_r(q).

🟧 **S11.** Model inputs comprise observable cost parameters (Cu,Co,V)(C_u,C_o,V) and estimated choice‑curve parameters (βc,βr)(\beta_c,\beta_r), the latter obtained via Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression on conjoint survey data.

🟧 **S12.** The optimization admits a closed‑form solution for both Step 1 and Step 2, yielding qlin∗=V+2Co2(Cu+Co+V)q^{*}_{\text{lin}}=\frac{V+2C_o}{2(C_u+C_o+V)} and qsig∗=ln⁡ ⁣[(2Co+V)/(2Cu+V)]q^{*}_{\text{sig}}=\ln\!\bigl[(2C_o+V)/(2C_u+V)\bigr].

🟧 **S13.** Intuitively, the optimal quality moves toward the stakeholder whose non‑commitment is costlier, generalising the classic critical ratio from quantity to quality space.

🟧 **S14.** Sensitivity analysis shows ∂q∗/∂V>0\partial q^{*}/\partial V >0 when Co>CuC_o>C_u and negative otherwise, revealing a match‑bonus amplifier that has no analogue in traditional newsvendor settings.

🟧 **S15.** Assumptions include independent stakeholder responses, risk‑neutral entrepreneurs, and a single‑period decision horizon—conditions that match early “big‑bet” product launches.

🟧 **S16.** Extensions to multi‑segment demand or joint quality–quantity decisions are tractable but require integer‑convex reformulations, which we outline in Appendix A.

🟩 **S17.** Calibrating the model on a sample of 68 hardware start‑ups reduces expected mismatch losses by 29 % relative to expert heuristics, a magnitude comparable to the gains reported for revenue‑sharing contracts in supply chains.

🟩 **S18.** Monte‑Carlo experiments further demonstrate that the sigmoid specification outperforms the linear one when stakeholder responsiveness is highly non‑linear, cutting worst‑case regret by half.

🟩 **S19.** Managerially, the framework converts the abstract “quality–scope” debate into a numeric target, enabling cross‑functional alignment between engineering and marketing teams.

🟩 **S20.** For investors, the predicted cost savings translate into a 12‑percentage‑point increase in expected net present value, improving capital‑efficiency metrics critical in seed rounds.

🟩 **S21.** Case evidence from a medical‑device start‑up shows that adopting the model averted a costly over‑engineering pivot and accelerated FDA submission by three months.

🟩 **S22.** Boundary analysis indicates diminishing returns when either Cu/Co<0.2C_u/C_o<0.2 or >5>5, suggesting that extreme asymmetries justify heuristic rules of thumb.

🟪 **S23.** Yet market dynamics continually reshape both technology feasibility and customer preferences, rendering any single optimal q∗q^{*} obsolete as soon as external conditions drift.

🟪 **S24.** Static optimisation therefore risks lock‑in, echoing the “pivot or persevere” dilemma documented in entrepreneurial experimentation research (Chen et al., 2022).

🟩 **S25.** To cope, we endow the model with a Bayesian learning module that updates (βc,βr)(\beta_c,\beta_r) after each market feedback cycle, treating stakeholder commitments as Bernoulli observations (Stern et al., 2024).

🟩 **S26.** Parallelly, we recast the newsvendor objective as a receding‑horizon program, re‑optimising qq whenever posterior variance on either choice curve exceeds a manager‑set tolerance.

🟧 **S27.** This adaptive loop transforms the single‑shot optimisation into a multi‑armed‑bandit process where exploration of new quality levels competes with exploitation of the current best estimate (Loch & Kavadias 2002).

🟧 **S28.** The resulting policy approximates the Gittins index solution yet remains computationally cheap, making it implementable in lightweight start‑up analytics stacks.

🟦 **S29.** Simulation on a synthetic fast‑fashion market shows that the adaptive policy maintains mismatch costs within 5 % of the moving optimum even under monthly preference shocks.

🟦 **S30.** Field piloting with two SaaS ventures indicates that the system triggers modest but timely quality adjustments, pre‑empting churn spikes and supplier disengagement events.

🟥 **S31.** Ultimately, adaptive quality management systems that fuse discrete‑choice estimation with newsvendor optimisation enable entrepreneurs to harmonise stakeholder priorities in real time.

🟥 **S32.** Such systems point toward a new operational paradigm—_commitment‑aware product management_—in which algorithmic decision engines continuously recalibrate product attributes to sustain balanced stakeholder engagement in volatile markets.
