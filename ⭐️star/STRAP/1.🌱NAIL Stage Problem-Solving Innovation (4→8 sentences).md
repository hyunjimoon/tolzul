**Mission**: "Carry as little as possible but choose that little with care"

### Stage Overview
**ADGC Focus**: Establish first two lines of MÃ¶bius progression (A0â†’Dâ†’G0â†’C0)
**Key Dilemma**: Theory push vs. literature pull
**Key Output**: Core anomaly-to-development linkage established
**Strategic Principles**:
- Speed over perfection: Identify anomaly quickly
- Experimentation mindset: Test different anomaly-development pairs  
- Customer intimacy: Focus on specific reader needs
- Pivoting readiness: Willing to change development path if anomaly shifts

**Validation Test**: Can you explain Lines 1-2 in 2 minutes?

#### STARTING POINT (4 sentences):

- **A (Anomaly)** ðŸŸªâ¬œ A0: Core degenerate problem
- **D (Develops)** â¬œâ¬œ (empty)
- **G (Grows)** â¬œâ¬œ G0: Baseline model preview
- **C (Contribution)** ðŸŸ¥â¬œ C0: Core robustness vision

#### YOUR TASK: Add 4 sentences to reach Lines 1-2

**Line 1: A0â†’A12â†’[A1,A2]**
- ðŸŸª A12: Show how core anomaly amplifies 
- ðŸŸª A1, A2: Split into two specific variations

**Line 2: [A1,A2]â†’D0â†’[D1,D2]**
- ðŸŸ© D0: Core development need emerges
- ðŸŸ© D1, D2: Specific development dilemmas

#### NAIL OUTPUT: 8 sentences = Lines 1-2 complete

- **Movement 1 Line 1** ðŸŸªðŸŸªðŸŸªðŸŸª A0â†’A12â†’[A1,A2]
- **Movement 1 Line 2** ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬œ [A1,A2]â†’D0â†’[D1,D2]
- **Preview** ðŸŸ§â¬œðŸŸ¥â¬œ G0, C0

#### APPENDIX A: NAIL Stage Examples (Lines 1-2)

**Line 1: A0â†’A12â†’[A1,A2]**
- ðŸŸª A0: "Variables dwarf constraints - fundamental paradox"
- ðŸŸª A12: "Paradox amplifies through stakeholder interaction"
- ðŸŸª A1: "Stakeholders hold different maps (q, Î²)"
- ðŸŸª A2: "Stakeholders move at different clocks"

**Line 2: [A1,A2]â†’D0â†’[D1,D2]**
- ðŸŸ© D0: "Need to navigate through surplus choice"
- ðŸŸ© D1: "One-step dilemma: learn-only vs act-only"
- ðŸŸ© D2: "Two-step lag: sequential approaches waste time"
