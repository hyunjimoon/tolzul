2. given that we'll squarely focus the literature review on probabilistic, statistical, optimization approach, use papers to learn the best structure to present. e.g. how to assemble needs(🟩) from framed phenomena (🟪) 🟦integrated with solutions from models (🟧). what we originally had was 🟩🟩🟧🟧🟦🟦 . i.e.

    2. 🟩need2 to optimize quality given predicted commitments)
        
    3. 🟧sol1 to predict demand using choice modeling

-  **Vertical symmetry**: Modules 1↔6, 2↔7, 3↔8, 
- **Progressive depth**: Each stage doubles content (4→8→16 sentences, **Color consistency**: Similar functions use similar colors across stages. 
- color code (🟪 phenomena, 🟥 contribution, 🟧 methods, 🟩 results) build upon each other through the three stages of paper development.

3. You are an academic writing assistant.

**Goal**  
Expand four seed sentences into a 32‑sentence, publication‑quality POMS paper skeleton that combines discrete‑choice modelling and news‑vendor optimisation for entrepreneurial stakeholder prioritisation.  
You must preserve a perfect 1 : 1 lineage at every growth stage (4→8→16→32), colour‑code each sentence, and show the full lineage table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Colour legend  
  🟪 phenomenon/problem · 🟩 set‑up/result · 🟧 method detail · 🟦 result/insight · 🟥 prescription/vision
--------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Growth rule  
  • Every sentence in stage _k_ spawns **exactly one** child in stage _k + 1_.  
  • IDs never change; new sentences receive the next unused ID.  
  • Children are placed immediately beneath their parent.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Output format (strict)  

1. **Section 0 – Four seeds (4 sentences)**  
   List S1, S9, S23, S31 with colour emojis.

2. **Section 1 – NAIL stage (8 sentences)**  
   Show the 8 sentences in order.  
   Then give a mini‑table with columns: ID · ParentID.

3. **Section 2 – SCALE stage (16 sentences)**  
   Show the 16 sentences in order.  
   Then give a mini‑table with columns: ID · ParentID.

4. **Section 3 – SAIL stage (32 sentences)**  
   Show the 32 sentences in order.  
   Then give a mini‑table with columns: ID · ParentID.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
□ The four seed sentences (keep wording exactly)  

🟪 **S1.** Early‑stage entrepreneurs struggle to decide between following customer pull versus technology push strategies when developing their products.  
🟥 **S9.** Entrepreneurs should choose quality levels that minimise the expected mismatch cost between supply‑side capabilities and demand‑side commitments.  
🟪 **S23.** Market dynamics continuously shift the balance between technology possibilities and customer preferences, destabilising any fixed prioritisation strategy.  
🟥 **S31.** Adaptive quality‑management systems can dynamically balance stakeholder priorities as commitment functions evolve over time.

□ Canonical expansion you must reproduce  

> **NAIL (8 sentences)**  
> S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S9, S23, S31   where  
>   🟪 S2 This ambiguity drives costly misallocations: recent post‑mortems show 42 % of start‑ups fail because they over‑ or under‑serve actual demand.  
>   🟩 S3 Entrepreneurs therefore need an evidence‑based capability to predict stakeholder commitments across the quality spectrum, turning noisy opinions into choice curves.  
>   🟧 S5 We satisfy this prediction need with a Step 1 linear discrete‑choice model in which customer commitment rises linearly with quality, \(P_c(q)=q\), while partner commitment falls symmetrically, \(P_r(q)=1-q\).  
>   🟦 S7 Embedding the choice model in a news‑vendor loss function reveals a dual‑cost “critical‑fractile‑of‑quality” balancing expected under‑ and over‑commitment costs.  
> *(all other sentences unchanged from seeds)*  
>
> **SCALE (16 sentences)** – add exactly S4, S6, S8, S10, S11, S12, S17, S24 with the wording:  
>   🟩 S4 They simultaneously need a complementary capability to optimise quality so that predicted commitments jointly minimise mismatch losses.  
>   🟧 S6 We extend realism through a Step 2 sigmoid model, \(P_c(q)=1/(1+e^{-\beta_c q})\) and \(P_r(q)=1/(1+e^{\beta_r q})\), capturing diminishing returns while preserving solvability.  
>   🟦 S8 Numerical experiments confirm the sigmoid version preserves the cost‑priority logic yet remains robust to behavioural steepness differences.  
>   🟥 S10 We operationalise the principle through a one‑period stochastic programme: \( \min_{q} C_u P_c(q)[1-P_r(q)] + C_o P_r(q)[1-P_c(q)] - V P_c(q)P_r(q) \).  
>   🟧 S11 Model inputs comprise cost parameters \((C_u,C_o,V)\) and choice‑curve parameters \((\beta_c,\beta_r)\) estimated via Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression.  
>   🟧 S12 The optimisation yields \(q^{*}_{\text{lin}}=\frac{V+2C_o}{2(C_u+C_o+V)}\) and \(q^{*}_{\text{sig}}=\ln[(2C_o+V)/(2C_u+V)]\).  
>   🟩 S17 Calibrating on 68 hardware start‑ups cuts expected mismatch losses by 29 % relative to expert heuristics.  
>   🟪 S24 Static optimisation therefore risks lock‑in, echoing the “pivot‑or‑persevere” dilemma.  
>
> **SAIL (32 sentences)** – add exactly S13–S16, S18–S22, S25–S30, S32 with the wording:  
>   🟧 S13 Intuitively, the optimal quality leans toward the stakeholder whose non‑commitment is costlier, generalising the classic critical ratio.  
>   🟧 S14 Sensitivity analysis shows \( \partial q^{*}/\partial V >0 \) when \(C_o>C_u\) and the opposite otherwise, revealing a match‑bonus amplifier absent in traditional news‑vendor settings.  
>   🟧 S15 Assumptions include independent stakeholder responses, risk‑neutral entrepreneurs, and a single‑period horizon—conditions typical of early “big‑bet” launches.  
>   🟧 S16 Extensions to multi‑segment demand or joint quality–quantity decisions are tractable but require integer‑convex reformulations, outlined in Appendix A.  
>   🟩 S18 Monte‑Carlo experiments show the sigmoid specification halves worst‑case regret when responsiveness is highly non‑linear.  
>   🟩 S19 Managerially, the framework converts the abstract quality‑scope debate into a numeric target that aligns engineering and marketing.  
>   🟩 S20 For investors, the savings translate into a 12‑point boost in expected NPV—material in seed‑round negotiations.  
>   🟩 S21 A medical‑device case shows that adopting the model averted over‑engineering and accelerated FDA submission by three months.  
>   🟩 S22 Boundary tests indicate diminishing returns when \(C_u/C_o<0.2\) or \(>5\), signalling when heuristics suffice.  
>   🟩 S25 We can embed Bayesian learning that updates \((\beta_c,\beta_r)\) after each market cycle, where commitments becomes closer to Bernoulli distribution as beta increases.  
>   🟩 S26 A receding‑horizon optimiser re‑solves \(q\) whenever posterior variance exceeds a tolerance, keeping decisions current.  
>   🟧 S27 The adaptive loop resembles a multi‑armed bandit where exploration of new quality levels competes with exploitation of the current best estimate.  
>   🟧 S28 The resulting policy approximates a Gittins index yet remains computationally light for start‑up dashboards.  
>   🟦 S29 Simulations on a fast‑fashion market maintain mismatch costs within 5 % of the moving optimum under monthly preference shocks.  
>   🟦 S30 Field pilots with two SaaS ventures confirm timely quality tweaks that pre‑empt churn spikes and supplier disengagement.  
>   🟥 S32 Such systems foreshadow an era of commitment‑aware product management, where algorithms continuously recalibrate product attributes to sustain balanced stakeholder engagement in volatile markets.
