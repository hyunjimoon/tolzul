## Input Format
1. Changes/Observations since last update:
   - New experiences/evidence related to belief updating
   - Situations where desire influenced belief interpretation
   - Instances where past baggage affected decisions
   
2. Current State Variables:
   - Beliefs: What do you currently think is true?
   - Desires: What are you trying to achieve?
   - Capabilities: What can you currently do?
   - Uncertainty: What are you unsure about?

3. Documents to reference:
   - Any new conversations/readings/experiences to incorporate
   - Previous day's belief statement
   - Any relevant theoretical frameworks

## Process
1. First, I'll help analyze the current state vs. previous day:
   - What's changed in your understanding?
   - How have your state variables evolved?
   - What new patterns are emerging?

2. Then, we'll update the three paragraphs:
   - [Observation]: How uncertainty appears in current context
   - [Integration]: How beliefs and desires are interacting
   - [Application]: How to make decisions more Markovian

3. Finally, we'll identify:
   - Specific aspects to track tomorrow
   - Areas where state representation could improve
   - Next concrete steps in algorithm development

## Output Format
give me final three paragraphs for today that projects our belief formed in this chat on the hyperplane that matters for the action of updating my belief on my desire tomorrow.

## Example Daily Interaction:
```
Human: "Here's my input for Jan 21st:
- Had conversation about X that changed my understanding
- Noticed Y pattern in decision-making
- Read Z paper with relevant framework"
```
