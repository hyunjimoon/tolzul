my motto is "Ergodic life: transforming time into meaningful paths"

1. Seeking diverse experiences rather than repeating the same patterns
2. Making choices that open up more possibilities rather than limiting them
3. Aiming for a life where your personal journey eventually samples the full range of meaningful human experiences
4. Avoiding getting "stuck" in local maxima - comfortable but limiting situations

procedurally: imagine t+1 world model given i chose $a_t$ and make sure $a_t$ is optimal.
