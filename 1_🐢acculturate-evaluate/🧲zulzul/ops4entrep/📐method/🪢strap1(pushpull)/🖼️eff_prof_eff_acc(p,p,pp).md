This figure visualizes how the three approaches (prediction, prescription, prediction-prescription) evolve in the 3D parameter space (q, Œ≤r, Œ≤c).

### **G1 Panel (Symmetric Case: Œ≤r = Œ≤c = Œ≤)**

In the symmetric responsiveness case where resource partners and customers exhibit equal sensitivity to quality (Œ≤r = Œ≤c = Œ≤), the parameter space collapses to two dimensions (q, Œ≤). Assuming, (q, Œ≤r, Œ≤c) changes from (0,1,1) to (q*, 2,2), the üü¶ **Prediction (Dual)** approach moves vertically from (0,1) to (0,2), achieving high **prediction accuracy** by correctly learning Œ≤=2, but suffers from zero **prescription effectiveness** as it remains stuck at q=0, unable to leverage its knowledge. The üü´ **Prescription (Primal)** approach moves horizontally from (0,1) to (ln(3/2),1), achieving moderate **prescription effectiveness** by reaching the newsvendor-optimal q* for its assumed Œ≤=1, but with poor **prescription profitability** due to using incorrect responsiveness parameters. The üü• **Integrated** approach moves diagonally from (0,1) to (ln(3/2),2), simultaneously achieving both high **prediction effectiveness** (correctly learning Œ≤=2) and optimal **prescription effectiveness** (reaching the true optimal q*), while demonstrating superior **update efficiency** by converging along the optimal curve q* = 1/Œ≤ ln((2Co+V)/(2Cu+V)) rather than requiring sequential steps.

### **G2 Panel (Asymmetric Case: Œ≤r << Œ≤c)**

In the asymmetric case where resource partner responsiveness dominates (Œ≤r << Œ≤c), the full three-dimensional parameter space reveals how different approaches handle complexity. Assuming, (q, Œ≤r, Œ≤c) changes from (0,1,1) to (q*, 2,5), the  üü¶ **Prediction (Dual)** approach moves from (0,1,1) to (0,2,5), achieving high **prediction accuracy** for both parameters but wasting computational resources learning the irrelevant Œ≤c=5, resulting in poor **update efficiency** and zero **prescription effectiveness**. The üü´ **Prescription (Primal)** approach moves from (0,1,1) to (ln(4),1,1), reaching a suboptimal q* based on incorrect Œ≤ assumptions, yielding moderate **prescription effectiveness** but potentially catastrophic **prescription profitability** when the true Œ≤r=2 differs substantially from the assumed Œ≤r=1. The üü• **Integrated** approach demonstrates intelligent dimensional reduction by moving from (0,1,1) to (ln(4),2,1), anchoring Œ≤c=1 upon recognizing its minimal impact, achieving optimal **prescription effectiveness** while maximizing **update efficiency** through selective learning - it ignores the irrelevant Œ≤c dimension and focuses computational resources on the critical Œ≤r parameter, converging along the reduced-dimension optimal surface q* = 1/Œ≤r ln((Co+V)/Cu).
