**The "evaluation complexity" problem formulation** (entrepreneurs can't evaluate which stakeholder to prioritize) is recommended over **the "missing metrics" problem formulation** (entrepreneurs lack effectiveness metrics) because academic literature shows [[📜CS_kemell20_identify(metrics, startups)]] demonstrates entrepreneurs have 118+ available metrics but struggle with evaluation complexity due to uncertain operating contexts, while [[📜CS_peng21_overload(information, decisions)]] proves that abundant information exceeds processing capacity and damages decision quality, supporting computational intractability rather than information absence as the core problem.
