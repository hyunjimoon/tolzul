This is the Earth4All-global jr model of a modern capitalist economy with endogenous distribution and an active state (the "Human World"). It is coupled to simple models of energy/climate and food/land (two important elements of the "Natural World"). The model is an early example of a (dynamic and causal)  global integrated assessment model, made to study the evolution of human wellbeing within planetary boundaries in the 21st century.
