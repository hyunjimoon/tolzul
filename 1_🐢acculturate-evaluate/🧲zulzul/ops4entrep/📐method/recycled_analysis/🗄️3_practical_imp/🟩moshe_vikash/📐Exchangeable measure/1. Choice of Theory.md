dd## Two choices
#### Practice chose theory and theory chose practice 

 simulation-based calibration
1. Data infrastructure: The pallet company already had an established infrastructure for data collection. This solved the problem you faced with bakeries, where inputting data was cumbersome and led to low user engagement.
2. Automation focus: The goal with the pallet company was to purely automate previously manual demand forecasting. This eliminated the need to account for cognitive biases, which had been an issue in the bakery project where you struggled with balancing mathematical optimization against customer satisfaction.

During my startup experience, I lost friends as I wasn't aware that I should also learn my desire, what I want, and what to choose. Loneliness is one reason that people sign up for entrepreneurship but calibrating my and other's expectation incurs great computational cost.

## Reason of Choice
Importance of entrepreneurship

## Chosen Complexities: Entrepreneurial Action}
Entrepreneurial ventures often face two overarching dimensions of complexity:

\paragraph{\textbf{Different Motivations Within One Venture}}
Entrepreneurs and early stakeholders can hold multiple, sometimes opposing, motivations. This is especially vivid in the mobility sector, where the same startup might include \textbf{profit-driven entrepreneurs} who prioritize near-term revenue from electric vehicles or ride-hailing services, \textbf{product enthusiasts} who love mobility itself and focus on building high-performance cars or aircraft, and \textbf{sustainability advocates} who see eco-friendly transportation as a core contribution and are willing to delay returns to lower emissions. Even if all parties align on “transforming mobility,” each group interprets market signals and technology updates differently. A surging demand for electric scooters, for instance, might be hailed by the profit-seeker as a rapid scaling opportunity, while the product enthusiast worries about reliability, and the sustainability advocate weighs its impact on urban congestion. Because each perspective influences practical choices—such as resource allocation, product features, or market timing—an entrepreneur must continually weigh and synthesize multiple streams of feedback. In doing so, they face conflicting signals, trade-offs, and evolving priorities that require ongoing re-evaluation of assumptions. This persistent tension underscores that effective modeling of an entrepreneurial venture must capture how heterogeneous desires interact with new data, rather than merely updating probabilities.

\paragraph{\textbf{Contrasting Approaches Across Multiple Ventures Pursuing the Same Vision}}
Complexity also arises when two different ventures, sharing the same ultimate vision, choose fundamentally different paths. \textbf{Tesla}, for instance, emphasizes a vision-only system powered by cameras and neural networks; its desire for a scalable, mass-market solution supports the belief that cameras alone can master human-like visual learning, focusing updates on neural nets and continuous fleet data. \textbf{Waymo}, on the other hand, employs a multi-sensor approach (LiDAR, radar, cameras) and invests in detailed digital maps; its desire for maximum safety drives the belief that redundancy and comprehensive sensor data are crucial, prompting methodical expansion in controlled geographies with multiple data sources. Although both companies aspire to a self-driving future, their core theories of how to achieve autonomy diverge, influencing how they filter incoming information, interpret experimental outcomes, and decide whether or not to pivot. These contrasting frameworks illustrate that even with the same end goal in mind, entrepreneurs can select fundamentally different solutions, each generating unique insights and trade-offs, while the broader ecosystem evolves around these divergent yet coexisting strategies.

\paragraph{Abstract Theory}
\label{par:sbc_theory}
\textbf{SBC (simulation-based calibration)} offers entrepreneurs a systematic way 
to evaluate critical assumptions about their ventures by testing how well a chosen 
business model or strategy “fits” the realities of the market. Instead of relying 
on gut instinct alone, founders can use simulated or real observations of customer 
behavior, costs, and other factors to \emph{update} (“calibrate”) their beliefs. 
By gradually reconciling what they expect to see (their prior assumptions) with 
what they actually see (data from experiments or early adopters), entrepreneurs 
reduce uncertainty and focus on the highest-impact levers. In turn, this process 
helps them avoid “noisy learning,” where scattered feedback or untested assumptions 
waste resources. Ultimately, SBC lets founders zero in on viable opportunities 
faster and pivot when evidence shows their initial strategy needs adjusting.

\paragraph{Example: Tesla’s “Vision‐Only” Assumption}
A concrete illustration comes from autonomous vehicle (AV) development. 
Tesla pursues a “vision‐only” approach, betting that camera sensors and neural 
networks alone can enable full self‐driving capabilities. This choice rests on 
two core beliefs: first, that large‐scale real‐time video data will be enough 
to handle the complex edge cases of driving, and second, that advanced algorithms 
can match or exceed the safety of sensor‐redundant systems used by competitors 
like Waymo. If Tesla’s core theory is correct, it gains a major cost and speed 
advantage—no LiDAR or high‐definition maps required. But if the assumption falters 
(e.g., unexpected scenarios that vision systems struggle to interpret reliably), 
the entire plan risks major setbacks. Here, rigorous calibration is essential: 
Tesla must keep testing how well “vision‐only” autonomy performs under varied 
conditions, comparing actual outcomes against the theory of camera‐based driving.

\paragraph{How Simulation‐Based Calibration Helps Entrepreneurs}
\label{par:sbc_how}
Building on “Simulation‐Based Calibration Improvements” from the draft thesis, 
entrepreneurs can keep their assumptions honest by weaving simulation and iterative 
inference into a single workflow. First, they run simulated scenarios under different 
parameter values—such as Tesla’s neural‐network accuracy or unexpected policy shifts— 
and compare these simulations against real‐world observations (\emph{posterior 
predictive checks}). Next, they adapt their priors if the simulations consistently 
deviate from reality (\emph{adaptive priors}). Finally, they repeat these cycles 
periodically, ensuring fresh data—from on‐road edge cases to changing customer 
demographics—continually reshapes the model. By integrating simulation results 
with SBC‐based re‐estimation, founders avoid drifting into blind spots and maintain 
a clear, up‐to‐date picture of how their chosen theory is holding up. This closes 
the loop between strategic planning and on‐the‐ground feedback, reducing “noisy 
learning” and enabling more confident, evidence‐driven action.

## Chosen Sector and Cases}
The transportation sector serves as an ideal test case for studying entrepreneurial decision-making due to its convergence of smart city initiatives, artificial intelligence, and sustainability goals. The sector exemplifies complex entrepreneurial challenges where technical feasibility and market dynamics are deeply intertwined, as seen in electric vehicle startups balancing battery technology with infrastructure development, and mobility-as-a-service companies discovering hidden patterns in customer behavior. This makes transportation ventures particularly suitable for applying the Bayesian Calibrated Choice framework, which helps understand how entrepreneurs navigate dual uncertainties in technical capabilities and market adoption while maintaining logical consistency in their beliefs and strategies. As cities worldwide invest heavily in autonomous systems and zero-emission mobility, studying how entrepreneurs in this sector learn and adapt provides crucial insights into decision-making under deep uncertainty.

## Chosen Belief}
This research builds on two beliefs I chose not to doubt. First, \textbf{probability theory is universally useful for agent calibrating for its action}. Universality is well established within probability theory domain. means modeling entrepreneurial decision processes, leading to internal exchangeability - the idea that our forward predictions should be consistent with backward inferences. I don't believe this tool can do everything but believe this is the best tool humanity has to distinguish what is representable and what is not yet representable. Second, \textbf{market responses are inherently heterogeneous}, leading to external exchangeability - the principle that any discovered patterns in this heterogeneity reveal meaningful structure.

Agent who accept two beliefs would be surprised by two types of information. Here, we use surprise as a cue to initiate belief update given one's desire and belief. Internal exchangeability helps detect inconsistencies where consistency is expected - for instance, when forward and backward reasoning about startup success contradict each other. External exchangeability helps detect patterns where randomness is expected - for instance, when similar patterns are discovered from two types of customer, it reveals unrepresented underlying structure.


## Chosen Questions}
This thesis addresses three key questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can entrepreneurs validate their mental models using internal exchangeability?
    \item How can they discover market structure using external exchangeability?
    \item How can these principles be implemented in practical decision tools?
\end{enumerate}
