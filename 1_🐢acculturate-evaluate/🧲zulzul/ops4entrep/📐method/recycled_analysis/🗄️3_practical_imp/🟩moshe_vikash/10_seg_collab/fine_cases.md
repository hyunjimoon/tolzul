## 4.1 Brief synopses of our cases

### 1. Angularity (disguised name) 
was founded in 2000 in Asia by a team of high-capability, young engineering graduates that developed expertise in the design and development of manufacturing process technology equipment for components and products for the electronics industry. Following its launch, the company repeatedly experienced challenges and disruptions to its markets, but each time used its deep manufacturing and technological capabilities to pivot to new products and new markets. For example, the company launched as a provider of manufacturing equipment for certain electronics components and products, which led to several years of signiﬁcant market success. However, an economic downturn led to an extreme collapse of the equipment market. 5 But the ﬁrm pivoted to enter the market for electronics components and products rather than for the manufacturing equipment—essentially choosing to go into direct competition with some of its customers. Their superior manufacturing knowledge enabled them to become the low-cost producer in these end-product markets. Across several later pivots, the ﬁrm’s technical capabilities enabled them to repeatedly enter new markets, ﬁrst for manufacturing equipment, and later for the end products. The company’s successful repeated pivots, in the context of fast-moving, technology-intensive markets, seemed to be due to its deep manufacturing and technical capabilities rather than to its connection to particular customers, markets, or products.

### 2. Banza
shorthand for garbanzo pasta, was founded in 2013 to provide a healthy, tasty pasta that was easy to cook and gluten-free. The founders had no experience in the food industry but started the project from their home kitchen and ran many experiments trying to ﬁnd a viable recipe. The company landed on a national reality television (TV) cooking show, Restaurant Startup, and despite a rocky start, it caught the attention of one of the judges who ended up investing in the company and became one of their ﬁrst distributors, stocking the shelves of the trendy restaurant Eataly with the new product. The TV show brought Banza instant exposure and other orders followed. When the young team began to scale production, their factory could not replicate their home kitchen recipe success and the startup lost many orders. As the team burned through their seed-round money, efforts shifted from promotion to production. The founding team “lived in the factory” as they frantically tried to perfect a scalable, reproducible pasta recipe. The initial Banza manufacturing process included over 50 variables that had to be constantly monitored. These intense efforts paid off, and Banza expanded from two stores to over 10,000 in the United States alone and garnered signiﬁcant media attention. Early tailwinds in marketing helped the ﬁrm, but unpreparedness for production scaling almost killed it.

### 3. BGI 
was founded in Beijing in 1999 (as Beijing Genomics Institute) with a mission to master the technologies of genomics—decoding the DNA of plants and animals to beneﬁt agriculture and human healthcare. BGI’s two founders were exceptional and passionate scientists, and the early years of their company’s life were devoted to seeking research grants for technical academic research and scientiﬁc capability building, not searching for markets and customers. Over time, their superior knowledge and capabilities enabled them to create products and markets for genomic sequencing and data. As a market leader, BGI employed segmentation to exploit multiple revenue-generating product lines including research, genomic sequencing for others, education, human health care, agriculture, and genomic data cloud services. However, after a great initial success, essentially creating and dominating these marketplaces, BGI subsequently faced severe competition in gene sequencing from upstarts focused on cost minimization, harvesting from the “ﬁelds” that were initially “plowed” by BGI.

### 4. MediTech 
developed sophisticated technology to improve brain imaging before and during cranial surgery by heightening image resolution through the exploitation of technological advances in imaging, plus adding in algorithmic innovation and computational horsepower to interpret the images. Presenting their improved images with an appealing user interface, MediTech’s solution had the potential to markedly improve cranial surgery outcomes. MediTech hired top-ﬂight engineers who were tasked with achieving the highest possible performance for its system. As a result, the engineering team selected suppliers with technologically superior capabilities and components. These suppliers, intended as collaboration partners, were mostly large and well-established players in their industries. However, collectively, the geography and size of the chosen supply chain created a logistical and business nightmare for small-lot prototype production and assembly. Not only were the transport lead times across the supply chain painfully long, but MediTech also lacked bargaining power to get fast turnaround times on prototype and component production from their chosen suppliers. Consequently, the prototype development and manufacturing cycles were dramatically elongated and the company did not have enough cash to endure the resulting delays, resulting in selling the company to a competitor. The net result was that early supply chain designs, implemented by engineers solely focused on the technological performance of the sourced components, were a key factor in preventing the company from meeting critical targets set by its capital suppliers.

### 5.MicroMetal 
was an Asia-based company, founded in the late 1990s, focused on ultra-high precision metal machining. The company manufactured top quality, technologically complex, high precision, machined metal parts for a demanding set of clients, and assembled subsystems for those same clients. Despite its strong customer relationships achieved over time, MicroMetal’s early activities focused on achieving and perfecting its manufacturing processes while postponing the development of markets or customers. MicroMetal was founded by a seasoned entrepreneur/investor who had prior experience in the metal machining business. That founder hired a CEO and a CTO and instructed them: “First achieve excellence in machining precision, then the customers will come.” With the resulting strong emphasis on perfecting its capabilities, MicroMetal’s state-of-the-art technologies and know-how eventually grew to serve leading companies in various industries. The company exploited segmentation to develop markets in machine tool, heavy-duty machines, commercial printing, aerospace, semiconductors, and manufacturing equipment industries. As the company grew, the CEO and CTO gradually deployed professionalization by adding experts in marketing, sales, manufacturing, ﬁnance, and human resources.

### 6. Metropoli 
is a family-owned business in India with a long history of traditional manufacturing and export of leather wallets, handbags, and other accessories as a contract manufacturer for fashion brands. Within global markets, Metropoli leveraged low labor costs in India to establish itself as a reliable, affordable provider of manufacturing services for (primarily European) brand name, high-end leather goods companies. Early reliance on channel partners for design concepts, market intelligence, and endcustomer channels enabled Metropoli management to focus on operational excellence and high quality, but they were also exposed to the processiﬁcation and professionalization of their value chain partners in design and marketing to high-end consumer brands. That exposure, and proﬁts from their role as a contract manufacturer, enabled internally generated capitalization to purchase and license some high-end brands and expand downstream into the design and marketing of these (licensed) branded items, capturing a much larger fraction of the value in its value chain.

### 7. MoS
was founded in 2010 at MIT by a team of engineers, designers, and material scientists, with the mission to invent a line of men’s business apparel that was classy, yet comfortable, and durable in the face of extreme usage conditions. The team combined clever marketing of “MIT meets Fashion” (e.g., images of James Bond’s need for extreme-performance tuxedos for his inevitable ﬁght scenes) with advanced materials and innovative product design. Their ﬁrst two product concepts raised 10 times their funding goal on Kickstarter. However, the very successful capitalization and sales campaigns ran ahead of operational capabilities. The company promised an expanded line of shirts, socks, undershirts, pants, and so forth, in volume, to their retail store customers. This segmentation sprint provides an example of “naked scaling,” where their marketing and sales ran ahead of disciplined processiﬁcation and professionalization in operations and supply chain management. They had to retrench and revise their plans as they built stronger operations capabilities, but their strong market position gave them the ability to maintain a positive image as a consumer brand as they built proper scaling capabilities.



### 8. Novaconfort
was founded in 2005 as a small family-owned construction company based in Cluj Napoca, Romania. The founders, with no experience in the construction business, started by bootstrapping a small renovation contract, in which they exploited contractors with well-developed professionalization capabilities to help them with processiﬁcation within their own small organization as they developed knowledge of the business and a network of experts. Despite their initial lack of experience in the industry, the small company ambitiously took on ever larger projects over time. The founders initially outsourced the most complex steps and jobs in each process but paid careful attention to the work done and documented all the learning, to the point where they became autonomous from outside experts. After the 2008 crisis in the real estate market, the company pivoted beyond construction and went into development and the rental business, remaining one of the few surviving companies of that size. Post crisis, Novaconfort continued to grow proﬁtably, yet ran into scaling constraints due to a reluctance to expand capitalization and senior management beyond the family owners.

### 9. Tesla
Roadster was Tesla’s ﬁrst car sold to the public. The company designed an initial supply chain that spanned three continents and resulted in very long prototyping cycles. In that initial model, the design and engineering of the key electronics and battery modules were performed in California, along with the ﬁnal vehicle test and tuning. The manufacturing and supply chain team lacked professionals from the automotive industry, and with a focus on low labor costs outsourced the manufacture of key modules to multiple sites in Asia. Further, due to capability requirements, vehicle assembly was located in Europe. The footprint of this outsourcing model yielded very long design-manufacturetest cycles—from California to Asia to Europe and back to California. Such long debugging cycles, especially for a ﬁrst-of-its-kind product, were not sustainable, and the company went through a major re-capitalization and a radical organizational change to restructure and redesign its operations toward more a more insourced and geographically compact manufacturing footprint, which enabled it to then debug and deliver the Roadster vehicles. The initial concept of minimizing costs by outsourcing manufacturing to low-cost geographies was supplanted by the insight that supply chain speed can often save more money than low-cost labor.

### 10. Renetech
was founded in 2003 as a professional services ﬁrm specialized in consulting and technology solutions for small- and medium-size companies facing challenges with legal compliance in the face of ever-changing global, regional, and local regulations in the energy industry. Renetech’s initial hires were all seasoned experts from the consulting and energy industries, and by 2018 employed over 150 people worldwide in ofﬁces across four continents. Due to the deep experience of the founder and his early hires, success in obtaining clients and installing high-quality technology solutions was straightforward for the lean staff that formed the early Renetech Solutions team. However, as volume and complexity increased, fresh college graduates were hired and had to be trained to a Renetech standard. Renetech realized late that had not given forethought to processiﬁcation needed for standardization and training, to improvement efforts with automation of many processes to manage their systems, and to evaluation capabilities to track metrics to measure success.

### 11. SkinnyGirl Cocktails
was founded in 2009 by Bethenny Frankel, a television personality who hit upon a concept for a premixed low-calorie cocktail drink marketed exclusively to women, a segment previously ignored by the major spirits companies. In very short order, SkinnyGirl became the fastest growing spirits brand in the United States, but the founder’s initial collaboration partner for fulﬁllment struggled to develop operational and supply chain capabilities to keep up with the market demands. Ultimately, due to this inability to rapidly scale its production and distribution alongside its exploding demand, the startup sold itself to a large beverage company for a value seemingly below the net present value of its future cash ﬂows. Subsequently, the larger ﬁrm was able to fulﬁll the order backlog but was unable to maintain the popularity of the brand. Although ex-post, one could argue that the founder got a proﬁtable exit for her startup, the case illustrates how an inability to scale operations in sync with market demand can impair the ability of

The extreme operations pivot that Tesla was forced to undergo under duress, is often not possible for a company that does not have backers with deep pockets. The lesson that Tesla drew from the Roadster experience was how short supply chains can increase development speed, which encouraged it to invest in a large, much more integrated facility (in Fremont California) for its next product generation, the Model S.

Unity Homes was founded by Tedd Benson in 2012 as a subsidiary of Bensonwood Homes, which had been a leader in designing and building high-end, timber-frame homes in the United States since the 1970s. Bensonwood invested heavily in learning Japanese and European manufacturing and homebuilding methods and invested in automation and human capital over the long term rather than hiring much cheaper day labor for house construction that would be shed at every downturn. Further, the company’s continual push for higher quality, durability, and precision led it to invest in digital design and Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) capabilities for manufacturing highly engineered, complex home components—wall panels, roof structures, and ﬂoor structures—in their enclosed factory in New Hampshire. On-site construction of homes became a single-week exercise of ﬁnal assembly with these panels rather than a months-long process of cutting, fabricating, framing, and installing thousands of components on the job site while exposed to the weather. The resulting homes had very high energy conservation capabilities and generated dramatically fewer defects and less waste. In an industry rife with defects, rework, and delays, Bensonwood came close to the zero-waste, zero-defects, zero-delay production



performance envisioned by the developers of the famed Toyota Production System.

Unity Homes was conceived to offer lower-priced homes but with a similar value proposition with regard to quality and energy efﬁciency. Unity homes were custom designed on a modular platform but offered less variety, less complexity, and smaller footprints than the typical Bensonwood home. Unity initially produced its panels in the Bensonwood factory, but that facility was not optimized for lower costs or lower variety required for the mid-tier market. In 2018, Unity opened a second factory in New Hampshire, designed for higher volume, lower variety, and lower cost, and had plans for replication of this factory design in different locations across the United States. The desire to maintain family control and expand through internally generated cash only slowed the growth as compared with what might be possible with a broader capitalization strategy.

VFA deployed a platformization strategy to create a business and management internship “fellows” program to match high-capability US millennials with startup companies that might not otherwise have ready access to such talent. Inspired in part by Teach for America, VFA aimed to recruit the best and brightest from the top universities, with a culturalization strategy to instill common innovation and entrepreneurship values throughout their network. VFA targeted small, entrepreneurial ventures in “second tier” entrepreneurial US cities (i.e., outside places like Silicon Valley, Boston, etc.) and deployed its elite troops into those ﬁrms, providing these startups with ﬁrst-class, albeit raw talent, and providing its recruits with a worm’s eye, hands-on experience in building a business. The ﬁrst cities selected, Detroit, New Orleans, and Providence, had existing entrepreneurial ecosystems in place but had a high need for exceptional talent. VFA then scaled their model with a replication strategy, copying the initial model for many other cities. The startups paid salaries to the fellows, but much of the organization’s overhead was covered by benefactors, whose donations represented charitable contributions for the sake of driving an industrial renaissance in some of America’s bygone business centers.

The resulting platform business model required a careful balance of the needs of all these stakeholders: entrepreneurial employers, fellows, donors, and civic leaders. The initial reactions to the model were strongly positive. VFA had a formula that worked. Having successfully nailed the model, VFA then faced the challenge of scaling the model from dozens to thousands of fellows, while managing its growing alumni and partner network.

The ASB was founded in 2015, in Kuala Lumpur, as a greenﬁeld collaboration between the MIT Sloan School and Bank Negara Malaysia. The ASB launched with a mission to become a “premier” business school in Asia and initially staffed its courses primarily with MIT Sloan faculty and curriculum, using generous scholarships in the early years to attract high-caliber students drawn from more than three-dozen countries from across six continents.

ASB’s platformization strategy was to leverage its Bank Negara funding and its MIT afﬁliation to attract high-caliber faculty, students, and corporate partners, exploiting positive

cross-externalities across these groups. ASB’s culturalization strategy was to blend key cultural features of MIT (egalitarian, meritocratic, entrepreneurial) in a very different environment from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and with a collection of students, faculty, and staff who had grown up with a very diverse set of cultural and educational values and norms. As a result, attempts at professionalization of numerous staff jobs led to challenges of (1) needing signiﬁcant acculturation for some new hires who had deep experience in their ﬁelds but did not have the context for a very different organization from their previous job(s), or (2) trying to build professional skills for people who were intellectually and culturally aligned but lacked experience in the areas they were hired to staff. The ﬁrst job of virtually every new hire in the early years was to ﬁgure out what his/her job should be. Not everyone could do that.

Processiﬁcation proceeded at very different rates in different parts of the organization, with the admissions and action learning teams formalizing their processes quite early, whereas marketing, career development, and faculty review processes, for example, evolved more slowly. Each new element of market segmentation, including new degreed programs or non-degreed executive education, for example, added new layers of operational complexity that strained the small organization and often required new subprocesses. Automation in the form of an industrial strength ERP system came too early to ASB and the resulting cost and human overhead were disproportionate to the need in the early stages of development. Measurement of progress in the early years was informal: Could ASB ﬁll its ﬁrst MBA class? Could ASB hire enough faculty, ﬁll key staff positions, source enough student projects, and ultimately help graduates get job placements? With light oversight in the early years, ASB moved very quickly and ﬂexibly, and its curriculum was noted in 2020 as being one of “The 10 Biggest B-School Innovations Of The Decade.” 6 Over time, however, board oversight driven by the shareholder led to the imposition of many layers of evaluation controls and measures, which slowed decision-making and forced cultural change from a risk-taking, jungle-trekker mentality toward a much more bureaucratic orientation driven by Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and fear of “audit ﬁndings” from SOP non-compliance.
