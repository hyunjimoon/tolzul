SEGMENTATION
"SEGMENTATION IS NOT JUST BRINGING ON NEW CUSTOMERS, BUT ALSO REQUIRES THE CAPABILITIES OF DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION. AND DELIVERY"

Early in the nailing stage, entrepreneurs are encouraged to develop their "minimum viable product for their "beachhead market" (Bill Aulet, MIT, 2024), and by necessity, a single market segment is typically targeted. If that target is well chosen, the

"total addressable market" will enable the firm to begin generating revenue and trigger the growth process. However, as, successful firms saturate their beachhead markets, they must explore how to drive growth into adjacent or different market segments. Such segmentation almost always accompanies the scaling stage and requires additional and more fragmented efforts in marketing, sales, engineering, product development, finance, and operations.

If processification is well underway, some of the developed processes will need to give way to specialized sub-processes. If automation commences too early, costly rework of automated processes may be required to accommodate new market segments with different needs. Segmentation almost always adds complexity and cost to the operations functions that support the products and services designed for the multiplicity of segments.

Thus, segmentation is critical for scaling but will challenge the operations function to expand its breadth of activities. Despite scale economies, unit costs may increase.

In the nailing stage, the first customers, are often found one by one, requiring significant investment by the founding team. As a company scales, this approach no longer physically works, but it is critical to continue the mindset of staying close to the customers, to continue to test new product or service ideas, and to remain responsive to feedback.

Segmentation can bring conflict - particularly between the sales and operations teams. Sales will typically want to serve as many customers as possible, despite a plethora of idiosyncratic demands. Operations will want to exploit high-volume processes and automation, made easier by lower product variety. Such tension must be addressed by senior leadership. A well-worn adage states that the first requirement of a good strategy is knowing what you are willing to say "NO" to. Some segments may not be worth pursuing.

Senior leadership therefore must articulate a strategy that addresses potential segmentation and growth conflicts - and put in place (with the help of Finance and HR) metrics and incentive structures to enable teamwork toward common goals, rather than creating silos with opposing objectives.



## Customer Value Proposition

|Customer value proposition|Understanding of competitors in your product category upon launch.|Very Poor; Poor; Somewhat; Fairly Well; Very Well|
|---|---|---|
|Customer value proposition|Number of direct competitors faced at product launch.|Various options based on startup age and type|
|Customer value proposition|Product comparison to key competitor one year after launch in terms of unique features and|Rival Had Big/Modest Advantages; Parity; We Had Modest/Big Advantages|
|Customer value proposition|Assessment of the breadth of customer segments targeted one year after product launch.|Too Few/Far Too Few; About Right; Too Many/Far Too Many|

## Marketing Sales

|Marketing sales|Understanding of conversion funnel, customer lifetime value, and customer acquisition costs one year after launch.|Little/No Understanding; Some; Moderate; High; Very High Understanding|
|---|---|---|
|Marketing sales|Percentage of customers acquired through channel partners in the first year.|0%; 1-24%; 25-49%; 50-100%|
|Marketing sales|Satisfaction with channel partners' performance in customer acquisition and service during the first year.|Extremely/Somewhat Dissatisfied; Balanced; Somewhat/Extremely Satisfied|
|Marketing sales|Assessment of overall spending to generate customer demand in the first year, given the capital available.|Overspent Significantly/Modestly; Optimal; Underspent (with reasons)|

These tables appear to be assessment criteria for evaluating a startup or new product launch, focusing on customer value proposition and marketing/sales metrics after the first year of operation.
