 After reviewing the transcript about the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) mentorship system, I'll extract relevant equations and comments, then express my answer as mathematical equations.

### Relevant Equations/Comments from the Transcript:

1. Quality improvement model: "Qj,t+1 = Qj,t + œâ1Aj,t + œâ2Mj,t + Œµj,t" (where Q is startup quality, A is advice implementation, M is mentorship received, and Œµ represents other factors) [From slide ~1:19:27]

2. Mentor learning rate: "They only update their beliefs from actually observing the startup itself, 2.8% most of their new perception is based on their initial perception of the startup plus whatever weight they put on." [1:39:19]

3. Information spillover between mentors: "The information spillover... is 71% so there's a really high degree of information sharing and mentorship interaction informs other mentors in the network." [1:39:30]

4. Impact estimate: "An extra hour of mentoring increases the amount of capital raised by 1.5 percentage points." [1:30:18]

5. Mentor belief updating: "Œºj,t+1 = Œ±1Qj,t + (1-Œ±1-Œ±2-Œ±3)Œºj,t + Œ±2Aj,t + Œ±3Mj,t" (where Œº is mentor belief about startup quality) [Simplified from belief updating discussion ~1:33:00]

### Three Mathematical Equations Summarizing the Findings:

1. **Quality Evolution Equation**:
   Qj,t+1 = Qj,t + 0.253Aj,t + 0.673Mj,t + Œµj,t

2. **Mentor Belief Updating Equation**:
   Œºj,t+1 = 0.028Qj,t + 0.699Œºj,t + 0.153Aj,t + 0.12Mj,t

3. **Information Sharing Equation**:
   Œºi,j,t+1 = Œºi,j,t + 0.71(Œºk,j,t - Œºi,j,t)
   
   Where Œºi,j,t is mentor i's belief about startup j at time t, and Œºk,j,t is another mentor k's belief who directly observed the startup.

üß¨digesting as influe think of this as selfish gene logic where human's nature is to desire for influence (whether biological or spiritual) and invest money, time, effort to satisfy that desire. i.e. my business model is to create and capture value using optimism of the five professors. several success examples is implementing the advice of mentor/investors have increase the startup quality as measured by one research using creative destruction lab venture accelerator database (description attached). using charlie's advice - you want others to feel excited about your research, and the recipe for others to get excited about something is, first find a shared vision (as you go up the ladder of abstraction, you can find shared vision with everyone e.g. from optimism of small scope like entrepreneurship to bigger scope of world peace). then given the shared vision, help them understand what they can contribute to they would find a "how" themselves.

## first paper
homogenous product
time path of demand and price ard deterministic and known
no aggregate product (can't affect the product)

decision1: enter market or not
decision2: observe profit - update my prior based on theta 

update my prior and choose exit or enter and if enter how many to produce

expected sum of disounted profit
theta bar (avergae)

firm's efficiency function x_t is determined by firm type (monot)

product decision

xi is not theta but theta + noise

-c(q)x_t (firm chooses quantity), 
expected sum of discounted 

every firm can't get profit


theta upper bar is theat i need to enter the market, 

given profit and cost function, production cost is lower than expected

‚≠êÔ∏ècost is noisier than profit

recovery cost is less than the (w<k)

after entering the market, every round significantly update their priors leading to large variability inoutputs overtimes

bad type -> lowers (overtime, everything evens out)

don't need cognition if selection pressure is high

disciplining effect of competition 

currently 

what do they know when they enter and what do they learn

sales and markeing vs product development

different levels of mentorshipi
