# 🛠️ KF2 Propose Model Hypotheses

## Question 🔐
How can proactive proposal-testing explicitly reduce computational complexity in entrepreneurial decision-making?

## Answer 🔑
Proactively proposing explicit entrepreneurial model hypotheses—clear, testable combinations of assumptions or modules—directly simplifies entrepreneurial decisions by eliminating complex recursive reasoning loops. Each hypothesis is directly evaluated with stakeholders (customers, investors, operational partners), drastically reducing unnecessary cognitive and computational overhead.

## Difference from Existing Models
Existing entrepreneurial decision models rely heavily on recursive reasoning, continuously revisiting uncertain hypotheses. Our proactive proposal-based approach directly presents explicit scenarios for stakeholder validation, significantly simplifying and clarifying decision-making processes.

## Production Plan⚙️
- Define explicit entrepreneurial scenarios as clear, structured hypotheses.
- Systematically present these hypotheses to stakeholders for direct evaluation.
- Capture stakeholder feedback systematically to clearly evaluate each hypothesis.
- Iteratively refine entrepreneurial proposals based on explicit stakeholder feedback, eliminating unnecessary recursive reasoning.
