```
        🐢 Can?                👾 User?
   Development chain:      Segment & 
   - Acculturate          Replicate chain:
   - Evaluate             Who needs process
   - Professionalize      improvement?
   - Processify           
              \                  /
               \                /
         Deliver? ←→  Sell?
                /              \
               /                \
        🐅 Goal?              🐙 Offer?  
    Process & Quality     Fulfillment chain:
    Improvement          - Collaborate
    (Internal &          - Automate
     External)           - Platformize
                        - Capitalize
```

**Deliver**: 🐅×🐢 = ✓ Development chain enables process/quality goals
**Sell**: 👾×🐙 = ✓ Users need fulfilled through CAPC progression
**$/time**: ✓ Value flows from culture → profit

**Learning**: Three cultures organize our capability development:
- **Bayes** (Mind): Acculturate → Evaluate (experiment & validate)
- **Innovate** (Bridge): Professionalize → Processify (scale what works)
- **Operate** (Hand): CAPC chain execution (deliver value)

## Key Insights from Diagrams
1. Employee satisfaction ↔ Rigidity tradeoff
2. Process improvement → Productivity → Cost management
3. Quality improvement → Revenue through replication
4. Culture drives experimentation drives improvement
