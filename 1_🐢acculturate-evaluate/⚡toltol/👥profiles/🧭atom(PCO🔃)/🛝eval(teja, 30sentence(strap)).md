Fine et al.'s Non-Integration Problem
- Quote: _"We could offer entrepreneurs our standard operations sessions... but mostly with cases and context from mature firms"_ - Shows optimization tools divorced from probabilistic startup uncertainty
- Quote: _"Business schools seem to have little to teach entrepreneurs"_ - Result of fragmented rather than integrated approaches
- Their 10 scaling tools are presented as separate components rather than integrated mathematical framework

Angie's key contribution: integrating statistical (`Uj(x) = β0j + β1j·price + β2j·quality` - Entrepreneurs statistically estimate stakeholder utility parameters from observable market data), probabilistic (`pr = exp[URP(x)]/[exp[URP(x)] + exp[UC(x)]]` - Converts utilities into probabilistic predictions about commitment timing under uncertainty), optimization (`Minimize expected cost via CR = Cu/(Cu + Co)` - Uses probabilistic predictions to optimize engagement sequencing) approach.

# V1. 30-Slide Sentence Composition Using Double Helix Structure

Based on the Double Helix framework and the STRAP paper structure from **🗄️(📜🪢🔴).md**, here are the 30 sentences that will become the opening sentences of each section:

## Phase 1: INTRODUCTION - Start Decomposed (Slides 1-12)

### 1.1 Phenomenon (Slides 1-4) - Practice Challenge

|Slide|Opening Sentence|
|---|---|
|1|Entrepreneurs face a critical sequencing dilemma when building ventures – whether to secure resource partners first or validate customer demand before committing resources.|
|2|Better Place built extensive battery-swapping infrastructure before securing EV adoption, burning $850M; Webvan scaled supply across 26 cities assuming demand would follow, losing $1B+.|
|3|Tesla initially focused on proving market demand while scrambling to finalize supply chains; Redwood prioritized processing technology before scaling customers, achieving market dominance.|
|4|These contrasting outcomes reveal that sequencing decisions – beyond individual action merits – significantly influence venture trajectories and survival rates.|

### 1.2 Literature Review (Slides 5-9) - Knowledge Need → Solution

|Slide|Opening Sentence|
|---|---|
|5|Entrepreneurs face a constrained optimization problem with freedom to choose stakeholder engagement order, resource limitations allowing only sequential engagement, uncertainty in acceptance probabilities, and noisy learning from stakeholder interdependence.|
|6|While Bayesian entrepreneurship advances heterogeneous belief theory, its focus on "venture success probability" as a random variable creates operationalization barriers for entrepreneurs and false positive problems for social planners.|
|7|Existing entrepreneurship literature lacks quantitative frameworks that integrate operations management principles with strategic stakeholder engagement under uncertainty and resource constraints.|
|8|We reframe entrepreneurial validation as a two-stage decision process where entrepreneurs first specify value propositions that directly affect resource partners' and customers' acceptance probabilities, transforming heterogeneous beliefs into operationalizable binary variables.|
|9|We apply newsvendor logic to the second-stage decision of stakeholder prioritization, where entrepreneurs optimize engagement timing by balancing 'overage costs' of idle capacity against 'underage costs' of missed opportunities.|

### 1.3 Contribution (Slides 10-12) - Integration Promise

|Slide|Opening Sentence|
|---|---|
|10|STRAP provides entrepreneurs actionable decision rules based on comparing overage versus underage costs, replacing intuitive heuristics with probability-informed optimization.|
