# Lecture 1: McDonald's vs. Burger King - Process Analysis and Trade-offs

**Date:** July 21  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Instructor:** Prof. Vivek Farias

## Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental process analysis concepts
- Identify trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility in operations
- Apply process mapping and capacity analysis techniques
- Recognize strategic alignment between process choice and market demands

## Case Studies
- **Primary Cases:**
  - [[Lec1_McDonald_s_Corp__Condensed_.pdf]] (Students M-Z)
  - [[Lec1_Burger_King_Corp_.pdf]] (Students A-L)
- **Supporting Materials:**
  - [[Lec1_Production_Processes.pdf]]
  - [[Lec1_Types_of_Processes.pdf]]

## Key Concepts

### Process Types Spectrum (PJBLC)
1. **Project** - Unique, one-time products
2. **Job Shop** - Low-volume, high-variety
3. **Batch** - Medium-volume, medium-variety  
4. **Line Flow** - High-volume, low-variety
5. **Continuous** - Very high-volume, commodity products

### Core Trade-offs
- **Efficiency vs. Flexibility**
- **Cost vs. Customization**
- **Speed vs. Variety**

## Case Analysis Framework

### McDonald's Strategy
- **Process Type:** Line Flow (standardized)
- **Value Proposition:** Speed, consistency, low cost
- **Operational Characteristics:**
  - Highly standardized menu
  - Pre-made inventory (make-to-stock)
  - Specialized equipment and layout
  - Minimal customization

### Burger King Strategy  
- **Process Type:** Hybrid (attempting customization in line flow)
- **Value Proposition:** "Have it your way" - customization
- **Operational Challenges:**
  - Conflict between customization and speed
  - Increased complexity in operations
  - Higher labor requirements
  - More inventory complexity

## Discussion Questions for Class
1. **Process Mapping:** Map out the production process for hamburger production, showing major process steps, inventories, and flows.

2. **Capacity Analysis:** For your assigned case, analyze peak hourly capacity vs. peak hourly demand for burger patties. Can they produce enough burgers?

3. **Strategic Alignment:** How well does each company's operational process align with its stated value proposition?

4. **Trade-off Analysis:** What are the fundamental trade-offs each company faces? How do they manage these trade-offs?

## Key Takeaways
- **Strategic Message:** A standardized, make-to-stock process (line flow) delivers low cost and speed, but struggles to accommodate customization, creating a core strategic trade-off.

- **Process Choice Implications:** The selection of production process type must align with market demands and competitive positioning.

- **Operational Excellence:** Success requires consistency between process design, capabilities, and customer value proposition.

## Preparation for Next Class
- Review capacity analysis concepts
- Prepare [[Lec2_JetBlue_Airways__Deicing_at_Logan_Airport.pdf]]
- Read predictable variability concepts

## Teaching Notes
- Emphasize the fundamental nature of the efficiency-flexibility trade-off
- Use concrete examples from the cases to illustrate process mapping
- Connect process choice to competitive strategy
- Highlight how operational decisions support or undermine business strategy
