## Required Readings
- **[SaaS Metrics 2.0: A Guide to Measuring and Improving What Matters](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/)**

### SaaS Metrics Article Key Insights:

**Core SaaS Principles:**
1. **Customer Acquisition:** Getting new customers
2. **Customer Retention:** Keeping customers engaged and subscribed
3. **Customer Monetization:** Increasing revenue per customer over time

**Critical Metrics:**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Total cost to acquire a new customer
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** Should be >3:1 for healthy SaaS businesses
- **Months to Recover CAC:** Should be <12 months, ideally 5-7 months
- **Churn Rate:** Monthly customer/revenue loss rate
- **Net Negative Churn:** When expansion revenue exceeds churn losses

**Unit Economics Framework:**
Can you make more profit from customers than it costs to acquire them? This fundamental question drives all operational decisions in subscription businesses.

## Key Concepts

### Customer Choice Modeling
- **Discrete Choice Theory:** How customers select among alternatives
- **Utility Functions:** Mathematical representation of customer preferences
- **Price Sensitivity:** Elasticity of demand to price changes
- **Substitution Patterns:** How customers switch between products

### Product Assortment Optimization
- **Attribute-Based Approach:** Focus on product characteristics customers value
- **Sales Data Limitations:** Past performance doesn't predict future preferences
- **Cannibalization Effects:** How new products affect existing sales
- **Variety vs. Complexity:** Trade-off between choice and operational efficiency

### Subscription Business Models
- **Recurring Revenue:** Predictable income streams
- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Total revenue over customer relationship
- **Retention Focus:** Keeping customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones
- **Expansion Revenue:** Upselling and cross-selling to existing customers

## Blue Apron Case Analysis

### Business Model Overview
- **Meal Kit Delivery:** Pre-portioned ingredients with recipes
- **Subscription Model:** Weekly recurring deliveries
- **Customer Acquisition:** High marketing spend to acquire subscribers
- **Operational Challenges:** Complex supply chain and logistics

### Unit Economics Challenges
**High Customer Acquisition Costs:**
- **CAC Problem:** Very expensive to acquire customers through marketing
- **LTV Challenge:** Low customer lifetime value due to high churn
- **Unit Economics:** CAC often exceeded LTV, making business unsustainable

**Churn Issues:**
- **Novelty Factor:** Initial excitement wears off quickly
- **Convenience vs. Cost:** Customers find alternatives more convenient/cheaper
- **Product-Market Fit:** Unclear if there's sustainable long-term demand

### Operational Implications
**Supply Chain Complexity:**
- **Fresh Ingredients:** Short shelf life requires precise demand forecasting
- **Portion Control:** Exact quantities needed for each meal
- **Logistics:** Cold chain distribution with tight delivery windows
- **Waste Management:** High perishability leads to significant waste

**Customer Experience:**
- **Meal Variety:** Need to continuously innovate recipes
- **Dietary Preferences:** Customization adds operational complexity
- **Delivery Reliability:** Service quality affects retention

### Strategic Questions
1. **Unit Economics:** How can Blue Apron improve its LTV:CAC ratio?
2. **Retention Strategy:** What operational changes could reduce churn?
3. **Market Position:** Is the business model fundamentally viable?
4. **Competitive Advantage:** What sustainable differentiators exist?

## Product Assortment Case Analysis

### Traditional Approach Problems
- **Sales-Based Decisions:** Drop products with low sales volume
- **Ignores Customer Preferences:** Doesn't consider why products succeed/fail
- **Limited Innovation:** Conservative approach to new products
- **Competitive Vulnerability:** Predictable assortment decisions

### Attribute-Based Optimization
**Customer Preference Modeling:**
- **Conjoint Analysis:** Understand relative importance of product attributes
- **Choice Experiments:** Test customer preferences under controlled conditions
- **Market Research:** Direct feedback on desired product characteristics
- **Behavioral Data:** Actual purchase patterns and sequences

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Better Forecasting:** Predict demand for new products based on attributes
- **Strategic Assortment:** Design product mix to maximize customer satisfaction
- **Reduced Risk:** Data-driven decisions rather than intuition
- **Competitive Advantage:** Unique assortments competitors can't easily copy

## Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

### CLV Calculation Framework
**Basic Formula:**
- CLV = (Average Revenue per Customer) × (Gross Margin %) × (Customer Lifespan)

**Advanced DCF Approach:**
- Account for time value of money
- Include acquisition and retention costs
- Consider expansion revenue potential
- Factor in churn probability over time

### Operational Decision Making
**Investment Justification:**
- **Customer Service:** How much to invest in retention?
- **Product Development:** Which features drive long-term value?
- **Acquisition Channels:** Which sources provide highest-value customers?
- **Pricing Strategy:** How to maximize long-term customer value?

**Segmentation Strategy:**
- **High-Value Customers:** Provide premium service and retention focus
- **Growth Customers:** Invest in expansion and upselling
- **At-Risk Customers:** Targeted retention campaigns
- **Low-Value Customers:** Cost-efficient service models

## Choice Modeling Applications

### Revenue Management Extensions
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices based on demand elasticity
- **Product Bundling:** Combine products to increase customer value
- **Personalization:** Customize offerings to individual preferences
- **Capacity Allocation:** Optimize inventory mix for customer choice

### Supply Chain Implications
- **Demand Forecasting:** Better predictions based on customer preferences
- **Inventory Planning:** Stock levels aligned with choice patterns
- **Product Lifecycle:** Understand when to introduce/discontinue products
- **Supplier Relationships:** Align sourcing with customer-driven demand
