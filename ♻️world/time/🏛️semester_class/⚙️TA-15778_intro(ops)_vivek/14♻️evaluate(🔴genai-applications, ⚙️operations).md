### TechCrunch Article Key Insights:

**AI Startup Proliferation:**
The article identifies a pattern in Y Combinator's 2023 batch where many startups followed a formula: "Pick a use case, do a little fine tuning of an available model, cherry pick some good examples for screenshots and bolt on a prefab UI."

**Critical Questions About AI Applications:**
- Is this really what's needed?
- Won't this need lots of oversight?
- Does this introduce liability or decrease transparency?
- Did anyone ask customers if they want this?
- Who verifies and audits the results?
- Who is displaced by these tools?

**Customer Experience Concerns:**
"Having AI, as it currently exists, do something for you is kind of like admitting that it doesn't matter." The article raises important questions about when AI enhancement actually degrades the customer experience.
