### Revenue Management Fundamentals
- **Definition:** The application of disciplined analytics to predict customer behavior and optimize product availability and price to maximize revenue growth
- **Core Principle:** Sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price
- **Prerequisites:** Perishable inventory, heterogeneous customers, advance booking capability

### Industry Applications

#### Airlines
- **Perishable Inventory:** Seats on specific flights
- **Price Discrimination:** Business vs. leisure travelers
- **Booking Patterns:** Advance purchase vs. last-minute
- **Capacity Constraints:** Fixed number of seats per flight

#### Hotels
- **Perishable Inventory:** Room-nights
- **Demand Patterns:** Business vs. leisure, seasonal variations
- **Length of Stay:** Different value segments
- **Ancillary Revenue:** Food, beverage, services

#### Other Industries

- **Cruise Lines:** Cabin category management
- **Theaters/Sports:** Event ticket pricing
- **Restaurants:** Peak time pricing
- **Ride-sharing:** Surge pricing (Uber/Lyft)

### Customer Segmentation

#### Willingness to Pay
- **Business Travelers:** High willingness to pay, low price sensitivity
- **Leisure Travelers:** Lower willingness to pay, high price sensitivity
- **Price-Sensitive:** Budget-conscious customers
- **Convenience-Focused:** Value time over money

#### Booking Behavior
- **Early Bookers:** Plan ahead, price-sensitive
- **Late Bookers:** Less flexible, higher willingness to pay
- **Group Bookings:** Different pricing dynamics
- **Frequent Customers:** Loyalty program considerations

### Demand Patterns

#### Time-Based Variation

- **Reference Pricing:** Customer expectations based on past prices
- **Competitor Pricing:** Market positioning considerations
- **Value Perception:** Quality-price relationship

## Revenue Management Models

### Single-Resource Models

#### Static Pricing
- **Newsvendor Extension:** Optimal capacity given fixed price
- **Price Optimization:** Find price that maximizes expected revenue
- **Demand Function:** Relationship between price and demand
- **Mathematical Formulation:** max p·E[min(D(p), C)]

#### Dynamic Pricing
- **Price Evolution:** How prices change over booking period
- **Information Updates:** Adjust prices based on observed demand
- **Optimal Control:** Dynamic programming approaches
- **Real-Time Optimization:** Continuous price adjustment

### Capacity Allocation Models

#### Two-Class Problem
- **High-Fare Class:** Limited inventory, higher revenue
- **Low-Fare Class:** Remaining capacity, lower revenue
- **Booking Limit:** Maximum low-fare reservations to accept
- **Protection Level:** Capacity reserved for high-fare class

#### Multi-Class Extensions
- **Fare Class Hierarchy:** Multiple price points
- **Nested Booking Limits:** Cumulative availability controls
- **Bid Price Models:** Opportunity cost pricing
- **Network Revenue Management:** Multi-leg optimization

### Overbooking Models

#### No-Show Problem
- **Customer Behavior:** Some confirmed customers don't arrive
- **Revenue Loss:** Empty capacity due to no-shows
- **Service Risk:** Denied boarding if everyone shows up
- **Optimization:** Balance revenue gain vs. service cost

#### Overbooking Decision
- **Costs:** Denied boarding compensation and customer dissatisfaction
- **Benefits:** Revenue from additional bookings
- **Probability Model:** No-show and demand distributions
- **Optimal Level:** Minimize expected total cost

## Implementation Strategies

### Demand Forecasting
- **Historical Data:** Past booking and consumption patterns
- **Market Intelligence:** Competitor pricing and capacity
- **External Factors:** Events, weather, economic conditions
- **Machine Learning:** Advanced predictive models

### Price Optimization
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different pricing strategies
- **Competitive Monitoring:** Track competitor prices and availability
- **Demand Sensing:** Real-time demand signal detection
- **Price Elasticity:** Measure customer response to price changes

### Technology Systems
- **Revenue Management Software:** Automated optimization engines
- **Distribution Channels:** Online, travel agents, direct sales
- **Real-Time Updates:** Dynamic pricing and availability
- **Performance Monitoring:** KPI tracking and reporting

## Strategic Considerations

### Customer Experience

## Performance Metrics

### Revenue Metrics
- **Revenue per Available Unit (RevPAR):** Total revenue / Available capacity
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** Total revenue / Units sold
- **Load Factor:** Capacity utilization percentage
- **Yield:** Revenue per unit of capacity

### Customer Metrics
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Service quality scores
- **Retention Rate:** Repeat customer percentage
- **Net Promoter Score:** Customer recommendation likelihood
- **Complaint Rate:** Service failure frequency

### Operational Metrics
- **Forecast Accuracy:** Prediction vs. actual demand

## Mathematical Framework

### Basic Revenue Function
- **Revenue = Price × Quantity Sold**
- **R(p) = p × min(D(p), C)**
- Where D(p) is demand function and C is capacity

### Optimal Pricing
- **First-Order Condition:** MR = MC (Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost)
- **With Capacity Constraint:** Consider opportunity cost of capacity
- **Dynamic Setting:** Future revenue implications of current decisions

### Capacity Allocation
- **Expected Marginal Revenue:** EMR of last unit in each class
- **Optimal Allocation:** Equalize EMR across classes
- **Protection Levels:** Reserve capacity for higher-value segments
