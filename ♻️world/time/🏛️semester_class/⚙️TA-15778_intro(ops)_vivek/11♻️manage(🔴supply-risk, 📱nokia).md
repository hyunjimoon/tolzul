# Lecture 11: Value Chain Resilience - Supply Chain Risk Management

**Date:** August 7  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Instructor:** Prof. Vivek Farias

## Learning Objectives
- Understand supply chain risk types and their impacts
- Analyze resilience strategies and their effectiveness
- Evaluate proactive vs. reactive risk management approaches
- Apply risk management frameworks to real-world scenarios

## Case Studies
- **Primary Case:** [[Lec11_Nokias_Supply_Chain_Management.pdf]]

## Required Readings
- **HBR Article:** [From Superstorms to Factory Fires: Managing Unpredictable Supply-Chain Disruptions](https://hbr.org/2014/01/from-superstorms-to-factory-fires-managing-unpredictable-supply-chain-disruptions)

### HBR Article Key Points:
Traditional methods of managing supply chain risk require estimations of how likely a disruption is to occur. For fairly common risks—poor supplier performance, forecast errors, transportation breakdowns—the traditional methods work quite well. But it's a different story for rare, high-impact events such as megadisasters, pandemics, and political upheavals. These risks are hard to quantify using traditional models, and as a result, many companies do not adequately prepare for them, which can have calamitous consequences when catastrophes do strike. A new model allows managers to quantify the impact of a supply chain disruption on a company's operational and financial performance, rather than focusing on the cause or likelihood of the disruption.

**Key Insights:**
- **Traditional Risk Management:** Works well for predictable, common risks
- **Black Swan Events:** Rare, high-impact events are harder to quantify
- **New Approach:** Focus on impact rather than probability
- **Risk Agnostic:** Mitigation strategies effective regardless of disruption cause

## Key Concepts

### Types of Supply Chain Risks
