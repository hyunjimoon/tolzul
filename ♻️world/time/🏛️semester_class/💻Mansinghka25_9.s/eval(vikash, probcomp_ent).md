# Entrepreneurial Decision Modeling with Uncertainty Minimization: A GenJAX Framework

  

## Abstract

  

Entrepreneurial decisions involve multiple sources of uncertainty that traditional models often oversimplify. Many entrepreneurs abandon formal decision models, defaulting to heuristic strategies like imitation. This project introduces a sequential uncertainty minimization framework for entrepreneurial decision-making. By modeling entrepreneurial strategy as a Markov decision process (MDP) with domain-specific state transition probabilities and uncertainty reduction metrics, our approach captures the complex interaction between temporal and spatial uncertainty in a computationally tractable way. We combine: (1) Explicit Uncertainty Measurement -- using a federated approach to quantify uncertainty reduction across stakeholder dimensions; and (2) Proactive Hypothesis Testing -- reducing complexity via efficient experiments.

  

We present an open-source GenJAX example demonstrating this framework in a Jupyter notebook, with step-by-step documentation for educational clarity. The example guides users through defining state spaces, uncertainty metrics, and transition tensors, then uses gradient-based optimization to identify actions that maximize uncertainty reduction per resource unit. This implementation serves as both a proof-of-concept and a teaching tool. Our model addresses the complexity of multi-dimensional entrepreneurial decision problems by providing tractable approximations based on practical uncertainty reduction principles.

## Introduction and Problem Context

  

Entrepreneurs often struggle to apply formal decision models in practice. Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDMs) from research tend to be unusable in real-world settings, especially when decisions involve many operational factors and diverse stakeholders. Current models rarely make uncertainty reduction explicit, despite evidence showing that quantifying uncertainty reduction is possible and that acquiring this information always comes at a cost.

  

Without a systematic framework for uncertainty reduction, founders resort to intuition or mimic successful peers. This imitation heuristic can sometimes yield quick answers, but it sacrifices the rigor of systematic uncertainty reduction and can mislead entrepreneurs when conditions differ from those imitated. The core challenge is that entrepreneurial decision-making is fundamentally an information acquisition problem, where each action's value should be measured by how efficiently it reduces uncertainty in the decision space.

  

Entrepreneurs face two fundamental dimensions of uncertainty:

  

- **Temporal uncertainty**: Entrepreneurial decisions unfold over time with significant unknowns. Founders must navigate how current actions (product development, market entry, partnership) influence future states of the venture. Traditional models often assume away these dynamics or bury them in intuition. In practice, entrepreneurs face unpredictable outcomes because cause-and-effect relationships over time remain unclear, forcing them into constant guesswork about the future.

- **Spatial uncertainty**: Decisions span multiple stakeholders -- founders, customers, investors, regulators, partners -- each with different objectives and information needs. Standard approaches typically collapse this into a single profit metric, ignoring the rich interdependencies across stakeholder domains. In reality, entrepreneurs must navigate market uncertainty, investor uncertainty, technical uncertainty, and regulatory uncertainty simultaneously.

  

When these two forms of uncertainty interact -- specifically when entrepreneurs face non-additive utility functions that depend on opportunity states -- the decision problem becomes provably NP-complete, as we demonstrate through reduction to the 0-1 knapsack problem (see Appendix B). This computational complexity result has significant implications for entrepreneurial practice, explaining why entrepreneurs often resort to heuristics rather than exhaustive optimization.

  

## Limitations of Existing Approaches

  

Entrepreneurial decision-making research offers a spectrum of approaches, but each has drawbacks in capturing the full complexity of uncertainty:

  

- **Heuristic-Based Approaches**: Methods like effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) rely on patterns from experience and "gut feeling." While cognitively tractable and sometimes effective, they lack a principled integration of all uncertainties. Entrepreneurs might imitate strategies of successful startups or use thumb-rules, achieving O(1) decision-making time but at the cost of inefficient information acquisition.

- **Classical Optimization Models**: One could formulate entrepreneurship as a multi-objective utility optimization problem or dynamic programming over a state space. Traditional models often reduce to a single objective (e.g., profit) with constraints, or use oversimplified representations of uncertainty. Comprehensive formulations quickly become NP-hard and computationally infeasible for realistic cases.

  

Our framework, **Sequential Uncertainty Minimization**, addresses these gaps by recasting entrepreneurial decision-making as a structured information acquisition process. We recognize that uncertainty provides a measurable quantity, and each action's value can be evaluated by its uncertainty reduction efficiency.

  

## Methodology: A Structured Uncertainty Minimization Framework

  

Our approach combines theoretical rigor with practical decision aids. The framework is grounded in practical uncertainty assessment and reduction techniques and decision science (MDPs, Bayesian learning) but is designed to be usable by entrepreneurs via an interactive tool. We break the solution into two complementary pillars:

  

### 1. Explicit Uncertainty Measurement (Federated Learning Analogy)

  

To tackle temporal uncertainty, we introduce an industry-specific state transition model. We construct a state space S capturing key venture states and an action space A for entrepreneurial actions. We then define a state transition tensor D of shape (I × A × S × S), where each entry D[i, a, s, s'] represents the probability that taking action a in state s will lead to state s' under scenario i.

  

By making D explicit, the entrepreneur can see how current decisions influence future uncertainties with concrete probabilities. This "Inform" step drastically reduces temporal complexity: it imposes a Markovian structure on the future, so the entrepreneur does not need to mentally simulate endless what-if scenarios--those are encoded in D.

  

For spatial uncertainty, we implement a multi-stakeholder uncertainty model. We formalize uncertainty reduction potential ΔUj across key dimensions for the venture's success. We define a cost function C(a) for each action, enabling us to calculate the efficiency of uncertainty reduction per dollar spent: ΔUj/Cj.

  

### 2. Proactive Hypothesis Testing (Explicit Proposal Evaluation)

  

Even with a clear model, entrepreneurs face computational limits in evaluating complex strategies. We incorporate an experimental approach akin to the scientific method in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs formulate explicit decision hypotheses and then test them directly with stakeholders and real-world feedback. Each experiment is designed to maximize uncertainty reduction relative to its cost.

  

This approach reduces both temporal and spatial uncertainty. Temporal, because testing provides early information about future states. Spatial, because stakeholder feedback directly reveals which uncertainties are being reduced. The net effect is a dramatic pruning of the decision problem: entrepreneurs focus on a few explicit uncertainty reduction experiments rather than an unbounded universe of possibilities.

  

### 3. Integration: Sequential Uncertainty Minimization

  

Combining (1) and (2), we arrive at an integrated framework for entrepreneurial decision-making:

  

- We maintain an explicit model (S, A, D, ΔU, C) that captures our current understanding of the venture's uncertainty landscape.

- We use this model to compute or approximate an optimal policy π: S → A that suggests the next action a for a given state s based on uncertainty reduction efficiency ΔUj/Cj.

- Rather than executing π blindly, each recommended action or sequence is treated as a tentative hypothesis. The entrepreneur gathers stakeholder input and outcome data, then updates the model.

- Over time, the model becomes a better reflection of reality, and the recommended strategies become more reliable. The process continues iteratively, creating an adaptive decision-making loop that is both data-informed and systematically reduces uncertainty.

  

## Application: Mobility Startup Example

  

To demonstrate the practical application of our framework, consider a mobility startup developing an innovative electric vehicle sharing service. The founders face numerous uncertainties across multiple dimensions:

  

**Market Uncertainties:**

  

- Will consumers adopt the service at projected rates?

- What pricing model will maximize adoption and revenue?

- How will competitors respond to market entry?

  

**Technical Uncertainties:**

  

- Can the vehicle battery performance meet service requirements?

- How reliable will the vehicle location tracking system be?

- What maintenance schedule will optimize vehicle uptime?

  

**Regulatory Uncertainties:**

  

- Will local transportation authorities grant necessary permits?

- What insurance requirements will apply to the service?

- How might regulations around shared mobility change?

  

Using our framework, the founders model these uncertainties explicitly and define actions to reduce them efficiently:

  

1. **Defining the State Space**: The state space includes customer adoption rates, technical performance metrics, regulatory status, and competitive landscape.

2. **Action Space**: The founders identify key actions like:

    - Running a small-scale pilot in a specific neighborhood

    - Conducting technical tests of battery performance

    - Meeting with regulatory authorities

    - Testing different pricing models

3. **Uncertainty Reduction Metrics**: For each action, they estimate:

    - Percentage uncertainty reduction across stakeholder dimensions

    - Cost and time required for each action

    - Uncertainty reduction efficiency (ΔU/C)

  

Using our GenJAX implementation, the founders discover that:

  

- A limited neighborhood pilot would reduce market uncertainty by 35% at a cost of $50,000 (efficiency: 0.7% per $1,000)

- Battery performance testing would reduce technical uncertainty by 60% at a cost of $30,000 (efficiency: 2.0% per $1,000)

- Regulatory meetings would reduce compliance uncertainty by 40% at a cost of $10,000 (efficiency: 4.0% per $1,000)

  

The model suggests prioritizing regulatory meetings first (highest efficiency), followed by technical testing, and finally the market pilot. This sequence maximizes total uncertainty reduction within budget constraints.

  

After conducting the regulatory meetings, the founders update their model with new information, recalculate uncertainties, and determine the next optimal action. This iterative approach ensures that resources are always directed toward the most efficient uncertainty reduction activities.

  

## Project Scope

  

This project lies at the intersection of entrepreneurial strategy and computational decision science. Its scope includes:

  

1. **Theoretical Framework Construction**: We develop a formal uncertainty minimization framework that integrates practical uncertainty assessment with entrepreneurial decision-making.

2. **Computational Complexity Analysis**: We provide formal proof of the NP-completeness of comprehensive entrepreneurial decision optimization and develop tractable approximation methods.

3. **GenJAX Model Implementation**: Using the GenJAX probabilistic programming toolkit, we implement the framework in an executable form. This involves writing clean, well-documented code that defines the model and performs inference/optimization within a Jupyter Notebook.

  

We consciously delineate what is outside our project's scope to maintain focus. We do not aim to solve the full general case of multi-objective MDP optimization. Instead, we focus on structured instances relevant to entrepreneurship, leveraging domain structure to simplify. We also limit the scope of the GenJAX example to a scale that can be run on a standard computer, ensuring it's educational rather than an industrial-strength optimizer.

  

## Technical Risks and Mitigation Strategies

  

We identify three primary categories of risk with corresponding mitigation strategies:

  

1. **Algorithmic Complexity Risk**: The decision model might become computationally intractable as we increase the number of states, actions, or uncertainty dimensions. We mitigate this by leveraging approximation methods and efficient computing through JAX for automatic differentiation and vectorized computation. We simplify the state space via abstraction and implement heuristic search algorithms that handle large MDPs with function approximation.

2. **Implementation & Integration Risk**: Developing a functional tool that integrates our theoretical model, data, and user interface could prove challenging. We adopt an agile, iterative development approach that breaks the implementation into manageable phases with working subsets of the system at each milestone. We use well-supported libraries (e.g., xarray for handling state data, Plotly for visualization) and conduct informal user testing.

3. **User Adoption & Validation Risk**: Entrepreneurs might be skeptical of the model's recommendations or find it difficult to trust a tool over intuition. We address this by designing a transparent methodology that shows the workings of the model. We plan to pilot the framework with institutional partners like MIT DesignX and the Martin Trust Center at MIT for early testing with student founders.

  

## Conclusion

  

This uncertainty minimization framework transforms entrepreneurial decision-making from gut feeling to systematic uncertainty reduction. By recasting entrepreneurial decision-making as a structured information acquisition process rather than utility maximization, we align our models with both theoretical principles and the reality of how entrepreneurs navigate complexity. This approach gives founders a systematic way to measure and maximize uncertainty reduction per resource spent, providing structure without sacrificing the flexibility needed in highly uncertain environments.

| 🔭    | **Scope and Introduction**                                 | We reframe entrepreneurial strategy as a polyhedral navigation problem, using probabilistic programming to simulate startup decision sequences under uncertainty.                         |
| 🧩    | **Mapping Segway’s Tasks to Action Categories**            | Segway’s development tasks are classified into four business functions—team, operations, market, finance—and mapped to four action types: culturate, collaborate, capitalize, segment.    |
| 🔁    | **Simulating Action Sequences Under Different Objectives** | We contrast two action sequences (original vs. balanced) using GenJAX-based uncertainty reduction trajectories to show how objective function preferences drive different decision paths. |
| 🧮    | **Polyhedral Model and Task Navigation Formalization**     | We formalize startup action selection as movement across vertices in a model polyhedron, guided by a simplex-like algorithm and informed by gradients of uncertainty reduction.           |
| ⚙️    | **Prototype Implementation with GenJAX**                   | We implement a simulation using GenJAX modules to model uncertainty dynamics, allowing sequential action optimization and posterior trace analysis for startup navigation.                |
| 🚧    | **Technical Risks and Mitigation Strategies**              | We address model misspecification, inference tractability, and data calibration challenges with modularization, structural heuristics, and analogical priors.                             |

Entrepreneurs may miscalibrate their strategy, as lessons from early experiments (often anecdotal) don’t easily generalize without a systematic framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

At each juncture, **KF1** recommends the next best action (whether to **Cultivate** employees, **Collaborate** with a partner, **Capitalize** by seeking funding, or **Segment** the market) based on maximum uncertainty reduction. This helps founders “find their path” from their unique starting state to their goal ([10104research to ocean_otter_ai.txt](file://file-2wk9rqtpnqmouqflib9yux%23:~:text=stated%20fine%20and%20find%20some,state%20to%20find%20their%20path/)), removing guesswork and giving a sense of direction amid ambiguity.**Personalized strategy via Strategic Identity:** With **KF2**, the founder’s own goals and values become part of the objective function. For instance, a technically minded founder might weight “team know-how” higher, whereas another might emphasize “market traction.” The tool adjusts its recommendations accordingly ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=cognitive%20science%20concept%20called%20resource,got/)), ensuring the strategy resonates with the founder’s identity. This customization builds the founder’s confidence in the plan and ensures that the suggested actions align with what they care about (their “why”).**Calibration and experiential learning:** Each proposed action updates a visual radar chart (KF3) showing the startup’s profile improvement (e.g. a previously critical uncertainty in product-market fit shrinking after a customer interview action). By seeing these effects, founders can calibrate their mental model – learning which actions have big impacts and which don’t. The interactive visualization serves as a sandbox for “learning by doing” in simulation, akin to a flight simulator for startups ([10104research to ocean_otter_ai.txt](file://file-2wk9rqtpnqmouqflib9yux%23:~:text=so%20alpha,%20how%20would%20i,what%20i'm%20thinking%20is%20it's/)), where asking the right questions and making small bets teaches the entrepreneur before real stakes are on the line. |

By using **KF2** to include stakeholder objectives in the simulation (applying the same strategic identity concept to an investor’s priorities, for example), the founder can perform “inverse planning” – predicting what an investor might do next ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=angie,okay/)). This capability turns opaque negotiations into more transparent, game-like scenarios, where the founder can test how changing a term or strategy might influence investor behavior. Such foresight encourages a shift to collaborative, win–win thinking (as all parties see value in uncertainty reduction ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=angie,know%20when%20i%20first%20met/)) rather than in exploiting gaps in knowledge).**Modular curriculum design:** For institutions like accelerators or university programs, **KF3**’s radar dashboard doubles as an assessment tool. A startup’s status in each dimension (team, product, market, financial, etc.) is made explicit. If the radar shows, say, a weakness in “team cohesion” or an exceedingly high “market uncertainty,” that is a signal to intervene. Using **KF1** to identify the most critical bottleneck and **KF3** to display it, the program can assign the founder to a targeted training module addressing that area ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=collaborate%20would%20be%20because%20it's,so/)). For example, a team with a toxic culture indicator would be routed to a culture-building workshop, whereas a team with high burn-rate (financial uncertainty) would get mentoring on capitalization and investor relations. This data-driven, modular approach means entrepreneurship education is tailored to each startup’s needs, making support more effective and timely.                                                                                                                                                                    |

KF2 aligns the tool’s recommendations with the founder’s own vision (so they are more likely to follow and learn from them), and KF3 provides continuous feedback – the visual trajectory lets founders see improvement and adjust their strategy in a cognitively digestible way ([10104research to ocean_otter_ai.txt](file://file-2wk9rqtpnqmouqflib9yux%23:~:text=stated%20fine%20and%20find%20some,state%20to%20find%20their%20path/)).**2.3 (Institution):** KF1 and KF2 together enable modeling of stakeholder incentives and responses, giving entrepreneurs a structured way to predict and include others’ behavior in their planning ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=angie,okay/)). KF3’s multi-factor visuals highlight each startup’s bottlenecks for mentors and educators, facilitating **modular support** (targeted advice or training where it’s needed most) ([svafa_Entrepreneur Strategy Integration_otter_ai.txt](file://file-dyudiqn26unyfjcebbg49z%23:~:text=collaborate%20would%20be%20because%20it's,so/)). This combination promotes a more transparent, collaborative startup ecosystem where every stakeholder can engage with a shared uncertainty-reduction framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Start with pilot programs at an accelerator or entrepreneurship course to gather data on various startup scenarios. **Iteration:** Calibrate the KF1 decision-rule with feedback from experts and adjust the visualization (KF3) for clarity. Integrate real startup case data (e.g. common metrics from programs like MIT DesignX) to refine the simulation’s realism. **Deployment:** Partner with incubators, venture studios, and investor networks to roll out the tool as part of their curriculum and due-diligence processes. Over time, this could standardize a new genre of “learning by simulating” in entrepreneurship, making the startup journey less trial-and-error and more systematically navigable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

2. Structured Jupyter notebooks with explanations, visualizations, and interactive examples
3. A more formally structured 4-page research abstract following academic conventions

# 🏭 Version 1: Technical Implementation Focus

## Title: ProbComp-Ent: Probabilistic Computing for Entrepreneurial Decision Making

### Scope Description

ProbComp-Ent leverages probabilistic programming with GenJAX to address the NP-complete nature of entrepreneurial decision-making under high uncertainty. It implements bottleneck-breaking operations through three integrated modules: room creation (business model space representation), motion planning (strategy exploration), and sensing (uncertainty reduction). The framework specifically targets far-horizon opportunities where traditional approaches fail due to the inability to pre-define evaluation metrics and predict stakeholder behaviors under causal complexity.

### Technical Risks and Mitigation Plan

1. **Computational Complexity Risk**: Entrepreneurial decision models may become computationally intractable as the number of stakeholders and interdependencies increases.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Implement approximate inference using Sequential Monte Carlo with rejuvenation techniques, and leverage JAX's parallelization capabilities to distribute computation across multiple processing units.
2. **Model Validity Risk**: Ensuring the probabilistic model accurately represents real-world entrepreneurial dynamics.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Implement simulation-based calibration checking to validate model consistency, and incorporate sensitivity analysis of objective functions to test robustness across varying conditions.
3. **Usability Risk**: Complex probabilistic models may be difficult for entrepreneurs to understand and utilize effectively.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Develop intuitive visualizations of the polyhedron business model space and uncertainty reduction paths, with interactive Jupyter notebook examples demonstrating practical applications to familiar entrepreneurial scenarios.

### Need-Solution Framework

|Step|Substep|Argument|
|---|---|---|
|**Need**||Entrepreneurial decision-making under high uncertainty lacks effective computational tools to model and reduce uncertainty|
|**Root Cause**|**Nature**|High causal density in entrepreneurial environments makes simple one-at-a-time experiments insufficient for finding optimal strategies|
||**Individual**|Entrepreneurs cannot generate reliable estimates of idea value and strategy effectiveness through traditional methods|
||**Institution**|Lack of tools to effectively model and update complex entrepreneurial decisions under uncertainty|
|**Solution**|**System**|Implement probabilistic programming with GenJAX for entrepreneurial strategy decisions|
||**Individual**|Develop Bayesian models to represent uncertainties in idea value and strategy effectiveness|
||**Institution**|Create simulation capabilities to explore potential outcomes of different strategies|
|**Implementation**||1. Develop polyhedron representation of business model space (room creation)2. Implement uncertainty sensing module for stakeholder interactions3. Create motion planning for strategy exploration4. Design interactive visualizations for strategy optimization|

# 🏯 Version 2: Entrepreneurial Application Focus

## Title: BayesStrat: Bayesian Strategy Optimization for Entrepreneurial Decision-Making

### Scope Description

BayesStrat addresses the fundamental challenge entrepreneurs face: making strategic decisions under extreme uncertainty where traditional evaluation metrics cannot be defined in advance. This open-source tool leverages GenJAX's probabilistic programming capabilities to help entrepreneurs "de-risk to the next milestone" through a subtractive rather than accumulative approach. By modeling interdependent opportunities and stakeholder relationships, BayesStrat transforms entrepreneurial strategy from an art into a systematic process of uncertainty reduction, particularly valuable for far-horizon opportunities where traditional linear planning fails.

### Technical Risks and Mitigation Plan

1. **Stakeholder Complexity Risk**: Accurately modeling multi-stakeholder interactions and their impact on venture outcomes presents significant challenges.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Implement a modular approach allowing incremental complexity, starting with core stakeholders (customers, investors) and expanding to include partners and employees as the model matures.
2. **Learning Curve Risk**: Entrepreneurs may struggle to integrate Bayesian thinking into their decision processes.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Create interactive tutorials with real-world entrepreneurial scenarios and develop a visual interface that translates probabilistic concepts into familiar business language and visualizations.
3. **Validation Risk**: Difficulty in validating model predictions against real-world entrepreneurial outcomes.
    
    - _Mitigation_: Partner with venture studios like Flagship Pioneering to implement parallel testing approaches, allowing comparison of model recommendations against actual outcomes in similar ventures over time.

### Need-Solution Framework

|Step|Substep|Argument|
|---|---|---|
|**Need**||Entrepreneurs struggle with noisy learning in the search for product-market fit, hindering effective decision-making|
|**Root Cause**|**Nature**|Rapid changes in business environments require frequent updates to decision-making models|
||**Individual**|Entrepreneurs lack effective tools for probabilistic reasoning in business contexts|
||**Institution**|Insufficient integration of Bayesian methods in entrepreneurship education and software tools|
|**Solution**|**System**|Develop Bayesian software that allows for rapid model updates and adapts to changing business environments|
||**Individual**|Create educational materials and tools that bridge Bayesian methods and entrepreneurial thinking|
||**Institution**|Integrate Bayesian software into entrepreneurship curricula and incubator programs|
|**Implementation**||1. Implement case studies of successful Bayesian entrepreneurship (e.g., Tesla's approach)2. Create interactive simulations demonstrating Bayesian decision-making3. Develop collaborative platforms for knowledge sharing4. Build a certification program for "Bayesian Entrepreneurship"|

## Addressing the "Why" from Bottleneck Breaking Operations

The traditional approaches to entrepreneurial decision-making face critical bottlenecks that our probabilistic programming approach addresses:

1. **Uncertainty Bottleneck**: Entrepreneurs traditionally struggle with defining evaluation metrics for success in advance, especially for far-horizon opportunities. Our approach inverts the problem from maximizing revenue to minimizing uncertainty, aligning with founders' practical mindset of "de-risking to the next milestone."
    
2. **Complexity Bottleneck**: The high causal density in entrepreneurial environments makes simple experimentation ineffective. Our approach handles this through sophisticated probabilistic models that can represent complex interdependencies between stakeholders, actions, and outcomes.
    
3. **Learning Bottleneck**: Traditional approaches produce noisy learning that fails to accumulate effectively. Our approach implements principled Bayesian updating that allows entrepreneurs to systematically reduce uncertainty over time, making learning cumulative rather than episodic.
    

By breaking these bottlenecks, our approach transforms entrepreneurial strategy from an intuitive art to a systematic process of uncertainty reduction through computational modeling.

## Key Concerns from Entrepreneur Strategy Integration

Several key concerns emerged from the entrepreneur strategy integration discussions:

1. **Integration of Operational Variables**: Current research lacks integration of operational variables with multi-stakeholder considerations. Our approach explicitly models interactions with key stakeholders (employees, operational resource partners, investors) as a ten-state vector representing uncertainty.
    
2. **Sequence Rigidity**: Traditional approaches impose rigid sequences from goal setting to hiring. Our approach allows for flexible action sequencing based on uncertainty reduction potential rather than predetermined steps.
    
3. **Scale Consideration**: Lean startup and effectuation approaches emphasize execution without considering scale in early phases. Our approach incorporates scale considerations from the beginning by modeling how early decisions affect later scaling options.
    
4. **Evaluation Metric Understanding**: Entrepreneurs often don't understand the meaning or implications of certain evaluation metrics. Our approach helps clarify the relationship between metrics and satisfaction with action sequences through simulation.
    
5. **Interdependence of Decision Making**: Entrepreneurial decisions are highly interdependent, making the problem NP-complete. Our probabilistic approach handles this complexity through advanced computational methods that can represent these interdependencies.
    

These concerns inform both versions of our approach, with the technical implementation addressing the computational challenges and the entrepreneurial application focusing on making these solutions accessible and relevant to practitioners.

# intro

- edm is np-complete as the opportunities are dependent and utilty are interdependent (proof in appendix)

# literature review

doesn't address operational variables between multistakeholders. i address this by defining four actions as investing resource to interact with 

  

far horizon opportunities require inverting the problem from maximizing the revenue to minimizing uncertainty. as founders often say "it's less about making progress, but more about de-risking to the next milestone, given long term goal" which shows their mentality is more subtractive, approximating from the outside, rather than accumulative, approximating from the inside. (terweisch) action sequencing approach has the benefit of

# methodology
- two algorithms: bottleneck breaking and consistency checking 
  
#### room generation
- module graph to polyhedron: ryan's multimodel programmaing as creating a room to search

#### sensor and motion function

it receives the data from the founder survey as a ten state vector representing uncertainty in employee, operatioal resource partner, investor, g(uncertainty can be reformulated as a distance between the value distirbution with the stakeholders)
- vikash's lab exercise as sense and motion module (localize to specific vertex on the polyhedron, move according to the direction that minimizes the uncertainty given the weight)

- weight is determined on the dilemma axis:
