weak version (RAT🐀) - is cognition well described (some way to construct a sensible prior; optimal "are you using the correct one")

strong version (OPT)
understanding, engineering

gelb/gilchrist (was able to make black white - probabilistic inference); how inference change in 1,2,3 examples

anchoring is helpful when you have lots of data (level2)

L= IR ()

making other people feel or act atypical, you'd set the stage more atypical -

reflectance value is uniform (L ~ [0,I])
size principle from number game (continuous vs discrete; possible pychophysics)

two different hypothesis on (smaller range ) - b
lumin (light level of the room and reflectance)

overall llight of the light is low, harder to (hard to see the difference) - not as many different value to detect

as I increase ()

L is data coming in you eey (R is what we're inferring; given L 0 to 1)
L = I * R, R is ratio, given L is higher than 9, then we know I is at least 9, 
I and R is same and R values (one)
weak preference for lowest possible illuminant (hypothesis. - )

p(t_total|t_total)

different between cognition (prior plays more role) and perception ()
connect this with size principle

first (size principle; tufa, horse) + second (tufa hier.clustering) -> third: prior and likelihood together (tree-structured hypothesiss )

generalization branch (how far in the tree we're probing) - one dog vs three dogs, three very different animals
after seeing three examples (change generalization - either narrow or broad)


suspicious coincidence (50%-50% nondumination)

best fitting simple function for prediction

jointly testing hypothesis; median of people (collective judgement; median of people and posterior median of ; whole distribution of people; different prior; but estimating differently)

avg prediction () optimal predictor (approximate bayesian)
form of (cure is close; function of different prior, different judgement)


sample from distribution (no mean or median) - give people distribution (typical value); 

exception proves the rule

right prediction from the right prior

cognitive impenetrable perceptual tasks, 
prior vary with qualitative form (plower law vs exponential; people perceive flow, not stock)


multiples of 10 to 2 (increase hypothesis of fifth greater)
lower probability but keep hypo.size;

first on decreased its confidence linearly, but second on sharpens up faster
(josh called avg over different regularity (trained to do ); how strongly should i generralize
