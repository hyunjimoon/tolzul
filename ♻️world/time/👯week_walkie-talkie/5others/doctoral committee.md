elimination list: In charge of a lot of programs, Unrelated to your field, Conflicting hypotheses, Unfair in classes, Already on 5+ committees
whether they care about the student's project, if they were helpful during the time of qualifying exams, if they have time to be on a committee, and finally if they are planning to leave the university
how the professors you are committed to your research

Adviser/Committee member 1:
I have a fantastic adviser who always stands by me and supports my work. He essentially fights for me if things go awry.
He is also the PI of the project I am working on so my successful graduation and publications do interest him.
Co-adviser/Collaborator/Committee member 2/Extradepartmental committee member:
He champions ideas behind my research and has done so for the last 20+ years. So there is no problem that I'll get support from him

Committee member 3:
Doesn't have anything invested in my research but since it is generally related to his work, he is on board.
He is sitting on the fence as far as criticism goes.
Committee member 4:
He doesn't like my work since his adviser didn't like this work and its implications.
However, since I have a generally pro-me committee, I should be alright but not without breaking a sweat.
If I convince him of the merit of my work, I'll have no problem in the future convincing any other detractors See comment by JeffE.
