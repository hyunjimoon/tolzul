Speakers highlighted the challenges of applying academic theories to real-world scenarios and emphasized the need for rigorous design and data collection. They discussed the role of experimentation in creating a mechanism for founders to adjudicate disputes with investors, streamlining the process of collecting data, and validating experiment design. The speakers also touched on the trade-off between experiment cost and valuation, and proposed a university-investor partnership to generate benchmarks. Overall, the conversation emphasized the crucial role of experimentation in gaining insightful results and making informed decisions in entrepreneurship research.

## **Outline**


### **The role of theory in business and economics.**



* Expert discusses the challenges of applying theoretical models to real-world problems in economics.
* Speaker 1 discusses the concept of a "moat" in business, highlighting the difference between competing on execution versus investing in intellectual property protection.
* Speaker 1 references a white paper on the topic, which emerged from a process of questioning and discussion with others in the field.


### **Entrepreneurship and decision-making.**



* Scott's wife Kathy shared how he had a different perspective on scientific work, valuing empathy and doing the right thing, which led to a friendship despite their differences.
* Kathy's conversation with Scott highlighted the importance of considering customer feedback in a more systematic and unbiased way, using randomization to get to the truth.
* Speaker 1 discusses the importance of modeling in entrepreneurship, using the example of oil prices to illustrate how probabilities can be assigned to uncertain events.
* Speaker 1 highlights the challenge of convincing oneself to continue pursuing an entrepreneurial venture, despite potential failure, and discusses the role of beliefs and probability in this process.


### **Decision-making in economics with optimal information.**



* Speaker 1 discusses the "workhorse model" for decision-making under uncertainty, which involves balancing the costs of exploration and the potential payoffs of exploitation.
* The speaker highlights the importance of considering the entrepreneur's perspective and the potential biases that can arise when using econometric techniques to analyze data.
* Speaker 1 explains the concept of "choosable" in economics, which refers to the ability to make decisions based on available data.
* Speaker 1 discusses the trade-offs between minimizing false positives and false negatives in experimentation, and how these choices are influenced by prior beliefs and product.


### **Entrepreneurial experiments and their success measures.**



* The speaker emphasizes the importance of conducting low BAR experiments in entrepreneurship, which are easy to pass and provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn't.
* The speaker notes that people often understand how to interpret low BAR experiments differently than high BAR experiments, with low BAR experiments providing affirmation and high BAR experiments providing the truth.
* Speaker 1 discusses the importance of experimentation in product development, highlighting the value of minimal viable products (MVPs) in reducing false positives and startups.
* Speaker 1 also mentions the concept of "high BAR" experiments, which require minimal effort and provide valuable insights into customer preferences.


### **Optimizing experiments for entrepreneurs.**



* Entrepreneurs prioritize low-bar experiments over high-bar experiments, despite potential biases.
* Speaker discusses the use of noise in decision-making, with a focus on the Bayesian approach.


### **Entrepreneurial optimism and experimentation.**



* Entrepreneurs choose high bar experiments to convince investors, as they are more optimistic and want to maximize upside potential.
* Minimum Viable experiments are valuable for businesses and investors, as they provide convincing evidence and demonstrate potential for growth.
* Entrepreneurs' optimism influences likelihood of starting a venture, with lower probability of success for those who need to persuade others.
* Pioneer of experiments on unbiased data to gain insights, but challenges remain in interpreting results and understanding data-generating process.


### **Multistage financing and real options in entrepreneurial finance.**



* Speaker 2 discusses multistage financing as a fundamental application of Bayesian entrepreneurship ideas, highlighting the importance of tying milestones to value inflection.
* Speaker 2 explains how to calculate the post-money valuation of a company at the B round, using the example of a biotech investment.
* Scott, a skeptical investor, is willing to pay $8.9 million to fund an experiment that could improve his expected value, despite only having a 10% chance of success.


### **Entrepreneurship, investment, and experimentation.**



* Speaker 2 discusses the importance of experimentation in entrepreneurship, emphasizing the need for informative experiments that provide valuable insights.
* The speaker highlights the benefits of high-bar experiments for both entrepreneurs and investors, as they provide more information and increase the value of the venture.
* Entrepreneur raises money at higher valuation, potentially increasing chances of success but also increasing risk of failure.
* Guidance on how much money to raise based on the amount of time needed to run experiments and generate information for next round of financing.
* Airbnb's early high valuation led to significant dilution in later rounds.


### **Low learning efficacy in early-stage tech ventures.**



* Speaker 2 argues that the growth of venture capital financing over the past decade has been uneven, with most of the increase going to IT, consumer products, and business services, while sectors like healthcare and hardware have seen little growth.
* Speaker 2 suggests that this dearth of capital in certain sectors may be due to a lack of investor interest or a lack of resources available to build these companies, particularly in universities.
* Speaker 2 discusses low learning efficacy in the materials sector, citing examples of long-term stability of electric catalysts and drug development.
* The rate of failure from preclinical to clinical trials is high, with less than 10% of drugs making it through Phase 123 and launch, due to a lack of predictive power in lab experiments.


### **Experimentation and entrepreneurship in venture capital.**



* Speaker 2 discusses the lack of well-developed benchmarks for customer discovery and experiment design in the venture capital industry, which can lead to moral hazard and friction in the investment process.
* Speaker 2 references a paper co-authored with Simon and others on the idea of moral hazard in experiment design, which explores the degree to which entrepreneurs might want to run less informative experiments to avoid killing the killer experiment.
* Professor suggests co-designing informative experiments with investors to validate entrepreneurial ideas.
* Speaker 2 highlights the need for clarity on the definition of "expert" in the context of experimentation.


### **AI research and data collection.**



* Speaker 2 questions the market size and feasibility of a medical device company's approach, citing lack of common language and ineffective distribution model.
* Entrepreneurs and experts discuss the importance of considering outliers in experimentation and data collection.
* Efficient data collection process streamlined, with 7000 data points collected in 8 years.


### **Startup financing and experimentation.**



* Speaker 5 highlights the challenge of making progress in a field despite feedback and suggests experiments to enhance legitimacy and social acceptance.
