modilgliani miller (investment opportunity set): doase

debt 

trade property right (resource allocation doesn't affect outcomes)

equity and debt are contingent 

⭐️if we agree on discount rate -> market imperfection 

Why This is a Problem

The Modigliani Miller Propositions

1 This is the backbone of research in corporate finance.

[What does it say?

I FIX THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY SET.

1 Assume perfect capital markets.

1 Then the value of a project is unrelated to how it is financed.

I (Note that this is a special case of the Coase Theorem)

The original upshot:

I Debt is not "cheaper" than equity.

1 In equilibrium, the risk of the assets determines the cost of capital

1 Adding debt just increases the riskiness of the equity

1 As a result, if capital structure matters, it must be because capital market imperfections matter.

I This has laid out a 75-year, still-ongoing research agenda.

BUT IT ASSUMES THAT THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY SET IS FIXED

OPERATIING AND FINANCING DECISION ARE SEPARABLE

1. who are the ones who agree on discount rate (perfect capital market - market friction - relaxing )
2. does increasing opportunity set usually lowers discount rate? (angie thinks more things happen with fixed period of time)
robinson has written on product market concentration - market power (less risky - absorb market shock)

perfect capital market (can have as much money at that price - bbc i can separate - cash flow and discount them -> can't do that)

human components in capital decision (e.g. when capital )

source of capital augements cash flow
value of project is function of the capital type , cash flows are contingent on capital, then we cannot do standard npv calculation

feedback loop and available capital 

⭐️corporate finance tells mayor to go home whereas ent.finance explains inavailabilty of capital as root cause of lack of innovative idea and give chance for capital reallocation

overall rights fall away -> early investor lose control as startup's gets more round
control rights (veto rights of budge, launching new product, ) tilted to vc early in the firm

why vc and founder would reach to different decision (answer: founder and )

poor information mapping and solution of 

not only different of information set but also their utility as well -> conception of opportunity set would also differ

dual class share separates control rights and cash flow

anti dilution clause 

entrepreneur and vc have different opinion (allow the ppl to disagree to come together) 

term sheets allow ENT and INVESTOR who had different mean and sd for success to collaborate 
- ENT: thinks the mean outcomes is high and variance is low (knock it out of the park) - lower variance, higher mean, 
- INVESTOR : swing  (higher variance, low mean)

strategy and finance collaboration

selection and treatment are different is known back tehn (didn't know what VC actually did)

  
more of your company for the amount of money.

nature of sorting and bargain power of (selection of unobservable - )

ask great question, thoughtful execution, creative in data

distribution of vc is exogenous to distribution of entrepreneur

vc has a fund (10yr) - 12 investments by 5miliion (100milion; 1)

another four goes sideway and kill you slowly; double down and follow on, move out capital out the door - vc have to get the money out the door (2004 - 3,4 years to deploy the capital)

capital you're raising, you're a VC, and I'm an institutional investor, and I like your investment ideas, so I commit capital to your farm. I do not like you a chair. I sign a legal agreement that compels me to provide capital when you call and you would generally have a five year window

fund underinvested, concentration toward the end

performance persistence (vc with strong fund1, fund2)

most favorable nation (extend to every other firms)

QnA with Robinson:
- both the goal utility and information differ for nerdy ent and vc
- want optimism; relative !=absolute optimism; cannot know venture success; term sheet

robinson mentioned venture sucess is difficult as it inclues knightian sense ->
