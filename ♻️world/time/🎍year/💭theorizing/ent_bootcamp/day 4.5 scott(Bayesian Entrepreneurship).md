🟪A12: How the components interact to amplify the anomaly: The decision is not a simple trade-off. The entrepreneur is incentivized to pursue the high-upside V, fundamentally altering the balance between the cost of over-promising (Co) and the cost of under-promising (Cu).  
🟩D12: The integration challenge: The central task is to solve this new objective function to find an optimal "promise level" (q*) that balances these competing forces.  
🟧G12: The integrated system that emerges: The solution to the model—an explicit formula for the optimal promise level: q* = ln((2Cu + V) / (2Co + V)). This is the core engine of our contribution.  
🟥 C12: This unified framework explains that an entrepreneur's apparent "overpromise bias" is not a simple cognitive flaw, but a rational output of their strategic posture. The framework (C12) works by showing how an entrepreneur's strategic lens (C2) determines their perception of the model's parameters (Cu, Co, V), which, when plugged into the prescriptive rule (C1), generates their promise level (q*). It unifies the mindset and the math, reframing bias as a calculated, context-dependent strategy.

### **A Walking Review: Classifying Strategy Literature with the Promise Vendor Lens**

This review sorts papers by how they align with our model's logic:

- **🟪 A12 (The Anomaly):** Papers that identify a complex puzzle where multiple forces interact, altering a simple trade-off.
- **🟧 G12 (The Engine):** Papers whose core contribution is a formal model or mechanism that provides a direct solution.
- **🟥 C12 (The New Lens):** Papers that offer a unified framework or paradigm, reframing a known phenomenon and changing how we think about strategy.

### 🟪 A12: Papers that Define the Anomaly

_(These papers highlight a complex interaction that breaks a simple trade-off, just as `V` alters the `Co` vs. `Cu` balance.)_

- **Gans, Stern & Wu (2019) – “Foundations of entrepreneurial strategy”:** Identifies the paradox of "strategic indeterminacy," where entrepreneurs face multiple equally good paths. The anomaly is that standard optimization fails, and the real challenge becomes the _process of choosing_ itself.
- **Gans & Stern (2017) – “Endogenous Appropriability”:** Pinpoints the anomaly that the ability to profit isn't a given; it's a choice. Entrepreneurs must actively build "endogenous appropriability," fundamentally altering the simple view of them as passive players in a fixed environment.
- **Lamoreaux & Sokoloff (2001) – “Market Trade in Patents and the Rise of a Class of Specialized Inventors in the 19th Century United States”:** Uncovers the historical anomaly of a thriving 19th-century "market for ideas." The existence of specialized inventors who only sold patents complicates the simple narrative of the lone inventor-entrepreneur.

### 🟧 G12: Papers that Provide the Engine

_(These papers deliver a formal model or explicit mechanism that solves a complex trade-off, like our `q*` formula.)_

- **Anton & Yao (1994) – “Expropriation and Inventions: Appropriable Rents in the Absence of Property Rights”:** Provides the game-theoretic "engine" for selling an idea without IP. The model of partial, strategic disclosure is the explicit mechanism that solves the information paradox.
- **Gans, Hsu & Stern (2008) – “The Impact of Uncertain Intellectual Property Rights on the Market for Ideas”:** Delivers a dynamic game model that acts as the engine for decision-making under IP uncertainty. The model explicitly shows how uncertainty levels shift the optimal strategy from cooperation to competition.
- **Luo (2014) – “When to Sell Your Idea: Theory and Evidence from the Movie Industry”:** Offers an "optimal stopping" model as the engine to solve the "when to sell" problem. It provides a formal rule for balancing the value of further development against market risk.
- **Malmendier & Lerner (2010) – “Contractibility and the Design of Research Agreements”:** Builds the contract theory "engine" for R&D deals with incomplete information. The model specifies how to use mechanisms like milestones and options to align incentives.
- **Gambardella, Gius & Stern (forthcoming) – “Homo Entrepreneuricus”:** Proposes a "Behavioral-Bayesian" model as the engine to understand entrepreneurial decisions. It formally integrates psychological biases with rational updating.

### 🟥 C12: Papers that Offer a New Lens

_(These papers provide a unified framework that reframes a behavior or choice as rational and context-dependent, just as we reframe "overpromise bias.")_

- **Teece (1986) – “Profiting from Technological Innovation: Implications for Integration, Collaboration, Licensing and Public Policy”:** The foundational "Profiting from Innovation" framework. It reframes the puzzle of why innovators fail to profit by showing that value capture is a rational, predictable outcome of the interplay between IP and complementary assets.
- **Gans, Hsu & Stern (2002) – “When Does Start-up Innovation Spur the Gale of Creative Destruction?”:** Offers the "deal or duel" framework. It reframes the startup-incumbent interaction not as a default war, but as a rational choice contingent on IP strength.
- **Arora, Fosfuri & Gambardella (2001) – “Markets for Technology: The Economics of Innovation and Corporate Strategy”:** Establishes the "markets for technology" paradigm. It reframes corporate strategy by showing that specializing in innovation and trading ideas is often a more rational and efficient system than vertical integration.
- **Hellmann & Puri (2000) – “The Interaction between Product Market and Financing Strategy: The Role of Venture Capital”:** Provides a unified theory of "finance-strategy fit." It reframes financing not as a separate decision, but as a strategic tool that must be rationally aligned with the speed and nature of the product market.
- **Eesley, Hsu & Roberts (2014) – “The Contingent Effects of Top Management Teams on Venture Performance: Aligning Founding Team Composition with Innovation Strategy and Commercialization Environment”:** Delivers the "team-strategy fit" prescription. It reframes the concept of a "good team" from a list of universal traits to a context-dependent alignment between team skills and strategic needs.
- **Hsu (2006) – “Venture Capitalists and Cooperative Start-up Commercialization Strategy”:** Presents a unified view of "VCs as strategic catalysts." It reframes the value of venture capital beyond money, showing it provides a rational pathway to a cooperative exit by signaling quality and reducing information friction.

A symmetric information model yields thresholds when deals occur versus competition. _Deal-or-entry model_                                                                      | C12: **Conditional Strategy Framework** – Prescribes that strong intellectual property and high transaction efficiency favor cooperation (market for ideas), whereas weak IP forces market competition. This bridged understanding guides entrepreneurs on when to sell or go it alone. _“Deal vs. duel” guidelines_                                                                          |

Entrepreneurs must deliberately **forgo** attractive alternatives when they cannot pursue all, requiring a method to navigate surplus options. _Forced strategic trade-off_                                                       | G12: **Integrated Choice Model** – Develops an integrated framework linking uncertainty and learning: as founders gather noisy information, they reach a “flat maximum” scenario of strategy choices. The model emphasizes process (choice architecture) over static solution. _Uncertainty–learning interplay model_    | C0: **Reframed Strategy Logic** – Reconceptualizes entrepreneurial strategy by highlighting _choice_ itself as central, not just analysis of environment. The contribution is a paradigm treating multiple viable strategies (degeneracy) as a feature of entrepreneurship, requiring proactive elimination of options. _Choice-centric strategy_                                             |

In a no-patent world, asymmetric information (inventor vs. buyer) creates belief gaps about invention value. _IP absence dilemma_                                                                                                                             | D12: **Reveal vs. Conceal** – Need to balance disclosing enough to attract buy-in while preventing idea theft. The inventor must harmonize trust and secrecy in negotiations. _Selective disclosure challenge_                                                                                                 | G1: **Signaling Model** – Offers a game-theoretic model where inventors partially reveal quality signals to strike deals without formal IP. Equilibrium shows some rent can be secured via clever information release. _Partial disclosure mechanism_                                                                    | C2: **Appropriability without IP** – Shows inventors can capture some value even absent legal protection, though not fully efficiently. Implies that improving contract institutions (or IP rights) would increase innovation efficiency. _Innovation rent with weak IP_                                                                                                                      |

Aligning incentives for teacher (licensor) and learner (licensee) is critical. _Tacit transfer arrangements_                                        | G2: **Contracting Model** – Develops a model for licensing agreements including know-how transfer (e.g. contingent contracts, royalties, training periods). Often a dynamic approach (learning by doing over time) is modeled to address gradual knowledge diffusion. _Tacit licensing model_                            | C12: **Extended Appropriability Theory** – Expands understanding of markets for technology by incorporating tacit knowledge. Suggests that even “unwritten” know-how can be sold via relationship-based contracts, bridging formal IP theory with real-world practice. _Selling the intangible_                                                                                               |

Without this, they struggle to innovate in complex domains (like medical devices), highlighting the need to integrate external knowledge. _External sourcing imperative_                    | G0: **Natural Experiment** – Uses an exogenous policy change as an empirical model to examine innovation outcomes. The analysis (difference-in-differences) tracks how blocked collaborations affect patents and quality, rather than introducing a new theoretical model. _Policy shock analysis_                       | C12: **Evidence for Idea Markets** – Provides causal evidence that open idea exchange increases innovative output and quality (firms without access shifted to less novel, lower-quality patents). Supports policies and strategies fostering collaboration for both effective (high-quality) and efficient (faster) innovation. _Value of open innovation_                                   |
| **Eesley, Hsu & Roberts (2014)** – _Contingent effects of top management teams on venture performance: Aligning team composition with strategy and environment_ (SMJ) | A12: **Misalignment Risk** – The impact of founding team makeup on performance is context-dependent. A “great team” on paper can underperform if their skills don’t fit the innovation strategy or market environment (strategy–team mismatch). _Contextual team fit_                                                                          | D12: **Team–Strategy Fit** – Need to align team composition with venture strategy and commercialization context. Entrepreneurs must recruit or structure leadership to complement their innovation type (e.g. R&D-intensive vs. market-driven) and external environment. _Adaptive team building_              | G12: **Contingency Analysis** – Employs an empirical contingency model: interactions between team characteristics and external factors predict performance. No single optimal team—uses statistical models to show different combinations win under different conditions. _Fit-dependent performance model_              | C1: **Alignment Prescription** – Recommends matching cofounders’ expertise to the venture’s strategic focus and industry setting for superior outcomes. Demonstrates that **effectiveness** in startups comes from the right team–strategy alignment, not one-size-fits-all team quality. _“It depends” principle_                                                                            |

Evidence from the U.S. patent “lottery”_ (Journal of Finance)                                   | A1: **Patent Value Uncertainty** – Innovators and investors held conflicting beliefs on how much a patent truly contributes to a startup’s success. The value of patents was an open question with anecdotal heterogeneity. _Patent value debate_                                                                                              | D0: **Appropriation Decision** – Need to decide whether seeking patents is worth the cost. Entrepreneurs require hard evidence on payoff (funding, growth) to guide IP strategy under uncertainty. _IP strategy choice_                                                                                        | G0: **Quasi-Experiment** – Leverages a “lottery” of patent examiners as a natural experiment to isolate patent effects. By comparing startups that barely got a patent vs. barely didn’t, it quantifies causal impact without a new theoretical model. _Patent lottery analysis_                                         | C1: **Patents’ Payoff** – Finds patents significantly boost firm outcomes (e.g. financing, scaling), providing concrete evidence that securing IP can be an **effective** strategy for startups. This informs entrepreneurs and policymakers of the tangible private value of patenting. _Patent premium quantified_                                                                          |

The paper emphasizes incorporating cognitive science to calibrate decision-making. _Debiasing and updating need_                   | G12: **Behavioral-Bayesian Model** – Proposes a model blending behavioral factors with Bayesian updating – entrepreneurs as “Homo Entrepreneuricus” who update beliefs but with subjective priors and biases. This hybrid model addresses both rational learning and psychological factors. _Bayesian-behavioral fusion_ | C12: **Behavioral Entrepreneurship Theory** – Contributes a richer theory that bridges psychology and strategy: entrepreneurs can be modeled as Bayesian decision-makers with personal twists. Suggests training and policies to account for these human factors, integrating prescriptive insights on how founders should adapt their decision processes. _Bayesian entrepreneurial mindset_ |
| **Gans (2017)** – _Negotiating for the Market_ (Advances in Strategic Management, Vol. 37)                                                                            | A12: **Preemptive Deals** – Highlights an anomaly in tech markets: rather than competing in a new market (“in the market”), startups and incumbents often negotiate **for** the market (one acquires control). This defies the assumption of inevitable market competition by showing an alternate path via deal-making. _End-run competition_ | D12: **Deal-or-Duel Choice** – Entrepreneurs need to decide whether to enter a market or sell/partner beforehand. This requires balancing the value of independent play vs. collaborating with a powerful incumbent – a navigation of conflicting incentives between parties. _Market entry vs. exit strategy_ | G1: **Strategic Bargaining Model** – Introduces a strategic model analyzing bargaining outcomes when a startup can negotiate transfer of a market (e.g. acquisition) instead of head-to-head competition. It identifies conditions (bargaining power, outside options) under which a deal occurs. _For-the-market game_  | C12: **Policy and Strategy Implications** – Shows that the prospect of negotiation changes innovation incentives (e.g. startups may innovate _to be acquired_). Bridges industrial organization and strategy by explaining when markets will be served via hierarchy (merger) vs. competition, guiding antitrust and startup strategies alike. _Deal-oriented strategy lens_                  |
| **Gans, Hsu & Stern (2008)** – _The impact of uncertain intellectual property rights on the market for ideas_ (Management Science)                                    | A12: **IP Uncertainty Friction** – When patent protection is uncertain (e.g. pending or weak enforcement), the market for ideas falters. Startups and incumbents face a misfit: they can’t trust deals fully, altering the usual cooperate-vs-compete calculus. _Patent uncertainty hurdle_                                                    | D2: **Timing Strategy** – Need to decide whether to wait for IP to solidify or proceed without it. Entrepreneurs must manage a sequential dilemma: delay partnering until rights are clear (slowing progress) versus moving ahead and risking expropriation. _Wait-or-go decision_                             | G2: **Dynamic Game Model** – Extends the collaboration vs. competition model by adding a stage of patent uncertainty. A two-stage game (pre- and post-IP resolution) shows that higher uncertainty pushes startups toward building a venture (competition) since secure deals are harder. _Two-stage IP game_            | C2: **Importance of IP Clarity** – Concludes that strengthening IP certainty can make idea markets more **efficient** (more licensing, less duplicative competition). It provides theoretical support for policies improving patent clarity and for startups to strategically patent to enable cooperation. _Secure IP, smoother deals_                                                       |

| **Gans & Stern (2000)** – _Incumbency and R&D incentives: Licensing the gale of creative destruction_ (JEMS) | A1: **Creative Destruction Detour** – Presents the puzzle of incumbents sometimes encouraging new innovation through licensing rather than being displaced by it. Incumbents can remain atop the “gale” by striking deals, which contrasts with the expected incumbent–entrant war. _Incumbent–entrant paradox_ | D12: **Co-optive Strategy** – Need for incumbents and startups to align incentives. Rather than racing, they can design licensing or acquisition arrangements so both benefit (incumbent preserves position; startup gains reward). _Collaborative innovation incentive_ | G1: **Innovation Race Model** – Offers a formal model of R&D competition where an entrant innovates and an incumbent decides whether to license or fight. The model shows how incumbency can increase R&D incentives if licensing is feasible, by internalizing the threat. _License-or-fight model_ | C12: **Bridging Schumpeter and Coase** – Integrates the Schumpeterian idea of destruction with Coasian bargaining: demonstrates conditions where the market for ideas allows incumbents to maintain innovation leadership through cooperation. This theoretical insight bridged innovation economics with strategy by showing incumbents can pay for peace. _Cooperative Schumpeterianism_ |

| **Gans & Stern (2003)** – _The product market and the market for ideas: Commercialization strategies for technology entrepreneurs_ (Research Policy) | A1: **Dual Market Paths** – Observes that technology entrepreneurs face two markets — product and idea — as alternative paths to commercialization, an anomaly relative to the one-path (product) assumption. _Two-route opportunity_ | D0: **Strategy Selection** – Entrepreneurs need to determine their commercialization route: either build a product/service company or sell/license the innovation. This entails evaluating internal capabilities vs. partnering opportunities from the start. _Route-to-market choice_ | G0: **Framework & Typology** – Provides a conceptual framework and case-based evidence categorizing startup strategies (integration vs. licensing). Rather than a novel model, it lays out a typology of factors (IP, competition, asset needs) influencing strategy choice. _Strategy typology_ | C12: **Entrepreneurial Strategy Playbook** – Contributes a practical and theoretical guide for entrepreneurs: emphasizes assessing both product-market and idea-market options. Bridges theory with actionable insight by linking market conditions to recommended startup strategies (e.g. license when incumbents hold necessary assets, go alone when you can build them). _Commercialization strategy compass_ |

| **Guzman & Li (forthcoming)** – _Measuring founding strategy_ (Management Science) | A1: **Latent Strategy Heterogeneity** – Not all startups are alike at founding; there are unobserved strategic orientations (e.g. high-growth “unicorn” vs. niche small business) that are not captured by traditional metrics, indicating hidden heterogeneity in entrepreneurial approaches. _Hidden startup types_ | D0: **Need for Strategic Metrics** – To manage and research startups effectively, we need reliable measures of founding strategy. This paper identifies the operational need to quantify a startup’s strategic intent early (for investors, policymakers, founders themselves). _Early-stage strategy signals_ | G12: **Empirical Classification** – Develops a measurement model using data (registrations, founding team, IP, etc.) to categorize startups’ strategies. Likely uses machine learning or econometric clustering, bridging qualitative strategic typologies with quantitative indicators. _Startup strategy index_ | C12: **Strategy–Outcome Link** – Offers a new tool linking founding strategy to eventual outcomes, enabling broader theoretical and practical implications. By measuring strategy, it bridges entrepreneurial theory with empirical analysis, and guides decision-makers (e.g. targeting support or capital to particular strategy types). _Founding strategy revealed_ |

| **Koning, Hasan & Chatterji (2022)** – _Experimentation and start-up performance: Evidence from A/B testing_ (Management Science) | A1: **Adaptive vs. Intuitive** – Some startups systematically experiment (A/B test) while others rely on intuition. This behavioral heterogeneity is an anomaly given the expectation that all data-driven approaches would be uniformly adopted in high uncertainty environments. _Experimentation divide_ | D1: **Data-Driven Decision Need** – Entrepreneurs need to resolve the “one-step split” between acting on gut instinct versus incorporating structured experiments. The paper underscores the need for startups to adopt an experimental mindset to avoid stagnation from guesswork. _Embed experimentation in decisions_ | G0: **Field Evidence** – Uses statistical analysis of startups that implement A/B testing versus those that don’t. Rather than introducing a new model, it leverages observational data (and perhaps instrumental variables) to assess the impact of experimental methods on growth. _A/B adoption study_ | C1: **Validated Learning Yields Success** – Finds that startups engaging in disciplined experimentation perform better (e.g. higher conversion, growth rates), implying that embracing **effective** scientific testing improves outcomes. This provides prescriptive insight that iterative testing is not just hype but adds real value. _A/B testing payoff_ |

| **Marx, Gans & Hsu (2014)** – _Dynamic commercialization strategies for disruptive technologies: Evidence from the speech recognition industry_ (Management Science) | A2: **Timing of Strategy Shift** – Startups with disruptive tech often change strategies over time (e.g. from licensing to product or vice versa). The anomaly is that the “best” commercialization mode is not fixed – it evolves as technology and markets mature (a clockspeed issue). _Evolving strategy puzzle_ | D2: **Sequential Strategy Adaptation** – Entrepreneurs need to manage a two-step (or multi-step) process: an early strategy that might differ from a later one. They must learn and pivot their commercialization approach as conditions change, rather than stick to an initial plan. _Pivot timing management_ | G2: **Longitudinal Case Analysis** – Combines industry case history with a dynamic perspective, possibly using a multi-period model or simulations. It traces how strategy choices (OEM licensing, direct entry, etc.) unfold over a technology’s life cycle, solving for optimal switch points. _Dynamic strategy model_ | C12: **Contingent Path Theory** – Demonstrates that the path to market for disruptive tech can involve planned transitions (not a single strategy). This contributes a nuanced theoretical lens: successful commercialization may require **efficient** early moves (alliances when young) followed by **effective** later moves (going direct when strong). It bridges static strategy theories with a temporal dimension. _Two-stage commercialization insight_ |

| **Gans & Stern (2010)** – _Is there a market for ideas?_ (Industrial & Corporate Change) | A1: **Cross-Industry Puzzle** – Asks why markets for ideas thrive in some sectors (biotech) but not in others. Variation in idea trading activity is the anomaly investigated, challenging any uniform view of innovation markets. _Uneven idea markets_ | D0: **Environmental Scan** – Entrepreneurs and policymakers need to assess the “market for ideas” in their domain. The paper highlights the need to identify whether conditions (IP regime, tacitness, buyer-seller matching) support an active idea marketplace or not. _Assessing idea market viability_ | G0: **Empirical Survey** – Provides empirical patterns and qualitative analysis rather than a new formal model. It surveys instances of idea transactions and their drivers, effectively creating a diagnostic framework for idea market presence (e.g. metrics of licensing prevalence). _Market prevalence analysis_ | C12: **Boundary Conditions** – Concludes that markets for ideas are not ubiquitous; they depend on factors like appropriability and complementary assets. This nuanced contribution integrates theory with real-world observation, guiding where an open innovation approach is **effective** and where internal development remains necessary (thus informing both strategy and policy). _When ideas trade (and when not)_ |

| **Gans & Stern (2017)** – _Endogenous appropriability_ (AER P&P) | A0: **Assumption Inversion** – Traditional models treat appropriability (ability to capture returns) as exogenous; this work identifies it as partly endogenous – entrepreneurs can shape how much of the value they keep (e.g. via strategy or technology choices). This overturns a core assumption, revealing a hidden anomaly in standard theory. _Appropriability as choice_ | D0: **Designing for Appropriability** – Need for entrepreneurs to proactively design strategies (patenting, secrecy, complementary assets) that increase their share of value. Instead of taking the environment as given, they must navigate choices that affect appropriation. _Appropriability strategy need_ | G1: **Model Extension** – Presents a stylized model where the innovator’s actions (e.g. development of complementary assets, contract design) feed back into the share of returns captured. By extending standard innovation models, it shows outcomes where appropriation is a decision variable, not a constant. _Strategic appropriation model_ | C12: **New Innovation Lens** – Contributes to theory by integrating strategy into the concept of appropriability: entrepreneurs are not passive takers of profit conditions; they actively manage them. This bridging perspective influences both theory (innovation models incorporating strategy) and practice (urging firms to invest in appropriability-enhancing activities). _Shaping the rewards of innovation_ |

| **Hellmann (2007)** – _The role of patents for bridging the science–market gap_ (JEBO) | A12: **Science–Market Disconnect** – Many scientific discoveries struggle to reach market because knowledge is hard to transfer and appropriate. This institutional gap is the anomaly: significant innovations languish in labs without mechanisms to bridge to commercialization. _Valley of death_ | D12: **Bridge Mechanism** – Need tools (especially patents) to connect inventors with entrepreneurs/companies. Patents serve as a bridge by codifying knowledge and providing tradable rights, aligning incentives between scientists and commercializers. _Linking invention to venture_ | G1: **Theoretical Model** – Proposes a model where patenting an invention improves the odds of it being commercialized by making transactions feasible (e.g. reducing uncertainty for investors or firms). It likely formalizes how a patent signal or right increases investment in an idea. _Patent bridging model_ | C12: **Policy Insight** – Argues that patents facilitate technology transfer, turning scientific advances into market products. The contribution bridges innovation policy and entrepreneurship: strong IP regimes can **effectively** increase commercialization of science (but excessive friction impedes it). This guides policy toward fostering patenting in academia and encouraging licensing. _Patents as commercialization bridges_ |

| **Hellmann & Puri (2000)** – _The interaction between product market and financing strategy: The role of venture capital_ (RFS) | A12: **Strategy–Finance Interplay** – Contrary to treating financing as independent, this study finds a nuanced anomaly: product market conditions (e.g. competition intensity) influence whether startups take VC money and how fast they go to market. Strategy and financing are entwined. _Competitive financing link_ | D12: **Synchronizing Funding & Strategy** – Founders must align financing choices with their competitive strategy. For example, in a fast-moving market, the need is to secure venture funding to scale quickly (outrun rivals), whereas in a slow market the need might be patience and control. _Financing–strategy alignment_ | G2: **Empirical & Model Combo** – Uses data on startups’ time-to-market and VC backing, and may present a model illustrating how competition affects the optimal financing path. Likely employs survival analysis or regressions showing faster launch with VC under high competition – capturing a dynamic decision. _Competition-driven financing model_ | C12: **Integrated Guidance** – Shows that venture financing isn’t one-size-fits-all: its value depends on market context. This contributes an integrated view that **efficient** startup success requires matching the financing strategy (VC vs bootstrapping) to product-market conditions. It informs entrepreneurs (and VCs) to consider market clockspeed in funding decisions. _Finance–market fit insight_ |

| **Hsu (2006)** – _Venture capitalists and cooperative start-up commercialization strategy_ (Management Science) | A1: **VC-Driven Path** – Finds heterogeneity in commercialization: startups with reputable VCs often choose cooperative strategies (e.g. being acquired) rather than going it alone, even at lower valuation, which is counterintuitive (why accept less?). The anomaly is the influence of VC backing on strategy choice. _VC effect on exits_ | D12: **Exit Strategy Alignment** – Need to align startup strategy with investor goals and networks. A founder backed by VCs must weigh the benefit of a quicker, certain exit via sale (leveraging VC connections) against independent growth. Harmonizing these interests is key. _Investor–startup strategy fit_ | G1: **Signaling Model** – Proposes a model where VC endorsement signals startup quality to incumbents, facilitating earlier acquisition deals. The model and empirical evidence show prestigious VCs reduce information gaps, making cooperative commercialization (like acquisition) more viable for startups, albeit at a “discount” for speed. _VC signal and early exit model_ | C12: **Strategic VC Value** – Concludes that beyond capital, VCs add **strategic** value by opening the market for ideas (connections to acquirers) and accelerating time to liquidity. This bridges finance and strategy, highlighting that a top VC can be an efficient catalyst for cooperation, not just a financier. _VC as strategy catalyst_ |

| **Lamoreaux & Sokoloff (2001)** – _Market trade in patents and the rise of specialized inventors in 19th-century USA_ (AER P&P) | A1: **Historical Specialization** – Documents that even in the 1800s, many inventors did not commercialize themselves but sold patents. This historical anomaly shows that specialized inventors thriving via patent trade is not just a modern phenomenon, challenging the view of the lone inventor-entrepreneur. _19thC patent marketplace_ | D12: **Institutional Support** – Need for institutions (patent system, brokers, patent attorneys) to enable inventors to sell inventions. The 19th-century experience underlines how legal and market infrastructure must develop to support a technology marketplace. _Infrastructure for idea trade_ | G0: **Archival Analysis** – Uses historical data (patent records, inventor careers) to infer the existence and scale of patent trading. No new formal model, but a narrative/empirical analysis showing patterns like serial inventors who repeatedly sold patents, indicating a functioning idea market. _Historical evidence study_ | C12: **Evolution of Innovation System** – Reveals that markets for ideas significantly contributed to innovation even in early industrialization, implying that efficient innovation systems often involve specialization and exchange. This insight bridges economic history with innovation theory, emphasizing that policies facilitating patent trade can foster inventive activity. _Origins of the idea market_ |

| **Luo (2014)** – _When to sell your idea: Theory and evidence from the movie industry_ (Management Science) | A2: **Timing Trade-off** – Idea creators face a timing anomaly: sell an idea early (fast but cheap) or develop it further for a potentially bigger payoff later. This “when to sell” decision encapsulates a clockspeed dilemma under uncertainty. _Optimal exit timing_ | D12: **Staged Value Realization** – Need to manage a two-stage process: initial development (to increase value) versus timely exit. Creators must harmonize development efforts with market timing – too little development and buyers undervalue the idea; too much and they incur waste or miss the window. _Development vs. exit balance_ | G2: **Optimal Stopping Model** – Introduces a dynamic model (real options framework) of idea sale timing, calibrated with movie industry data. It derives conditions for selling now vs. later by weighing the gains from further development against risk of obsolescence or idea theft. _Idea sale timing model_ | C1: **Timing Strategy Guidance** – Delivers prescriptive insights: e.g. if incremental development greatly improves certainty or value, wait; if not, sell early. Thus it provides **effective** decision rules for innovators on maximizing returns. Empirically, using Hollywood sales data, it validates these rules (e.g. spec scripts with moderate development sell best). _When-to-sell rule_ |

| **Malmendier & Lerner (2010)** – _Contractibility and the design of research agreements_ (AER) | A12: **Incomplete Contract Challenge** – In collaborative R&D, many outcomes are non-contractible (can’t be clearly measured or enforced), creating an anomaly where standard contracts fail. This leads to potential misaligned incentives between research partners. _Uncontractible R&D problem_ | D12: **Innovative Contracts** – Need for creative contract structures (milestones, equity splits, option-like provisions) to cope with unverifiable research progress. Parties must align goals despite the inability to write complete contracts, requiring trust and contingent agreements. _Milestone-based contracting_ | G1: **Contract Theory Model** – Develops a principal–agent model of a research partnership where some tasks/results can’t be specified upfront. An optimal contract is derived that uses available signals (like intermediate milestones or termination options) to incentivize innovation under limited contractibility. _Optimal R&D contract design_ | C2: **Efficient Collaboration Design** – Offers theoretical guidance on structuring R&D deals to maximize joint payoffs under contracting limits. By identifying mechanisms to mitigate moral hazard and hold-up, it contributes to more **efficient** industry-science collaborations and informs policy on how legal frameworks could improve research contractibility. _Designing efficient R&D deals_ |

| **Teece (1986)** – _Profiting from technological innovation: Implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy_ (Research Policy) | A0: **Who Profits Paradox** – Poses the fundamental anomaly that innovating firms often fail to capture the profits from their own innovations. Instead, imitators or owners of complementary assets sometimes win, contradicting the expectation that creators profit most. _Innovator’s dilemma (profits)_ | D12: **Complementary Asset Need** – Innovators must secure access to complementary assets (manufacturing, distribution, etc.) or appropriate regimes to profit. This creates a strategic need either to integrate (do it yourself) or collaborate/license – aligning innovation with the asset holders. _Asset–innovation alignment_ | G12: **Integrative Framework** – Introduces a qualitative framework (no heavy math) classifying complementary assets (generic, specialized, co-specialized) and analyzing how appropriability regimes interact with asset distribution. It’s a mapping of scenarios rather than a formal model, effectively bridging economics and strategy. _Complementary asset matrix_ | C12: **Theory of Innovation Value Capture** – Provides a seminal contribution: a comprehensive model of how and when innovators can profit, integrating factors of IP strength and asset control. This framework has broad prescriptive reach – guiding managers to either build, borrow, or buy complementary assets – and shaped subsequent theory on **effective** innovation commercialization and **efficient** industry structure for innovation. _Profiting from innovation framework_ |
