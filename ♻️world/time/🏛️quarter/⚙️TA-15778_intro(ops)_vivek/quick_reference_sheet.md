# üéØ Operations Quick Reference Sheet

## The Master Framework
**Every Operations Problem = WANT - HAVE √ó Environment = Trade-off**

## TQFP Dimensions
- **T**ime: Speed of delivery/service
- **Q**uality: Consistency, reliability, features
- **F**lexibility: Customization, adaptability
- **P**rice: Cost to customer

## The 16 Trade-offs You'll See

### Week 1: Process Design

## Key Formulas by Session
- **Session 1**: Utilization = Demand/Capacity
- **Session 5**: EOQ = ‚àö(2DS/H)
- **Session 7**: Pooled œÉ = œÉ/‚àön
- **Session 8**: Critical Ratio = (Price-Cost)/(Price-Salvage)
- **Session 12**: Revenue = Œ£(Price √ó Demand) by segment

## Questions to Ask Every Class

2. What forces this choice? (Environment)
3. What would it cost to change? (Investment)
4. Who chose differently? (Competition)
