‚≠êÔ∏èbottleneck at RY -> build up -> translate build up to delay, 

fluid proces -> lose integrality (goal is capture first order effect)

peak delay will be higher, avg delay will be lower

## Learning Objectives
- Apply capacity analysis tools to service operations
- Use queuing theory to diagnose bottlenecks and wait times
- Analyze sources of variability in healthcare processes
- Develop operational improvement recommendations

## Case Studies
- **Primary Case:** [[Assignment_PATA_Massachusetts_General_Hospital_s_Pre-Admission_Testing_Area__PATA_.pdf]]
- **Supporting Case:** [[Lec4_Intermountain_Health_Care.pdf]] (SKIM)
## Key Concepts

### Process Analysis Tools
1. **Build-up Diagrams:** Visual representation of capacity vs. demand over time
2. **Queuing Theory:** Mathematical analysis of waiting lines
3. **Bottleneck Identification:** Finding constraining resources
4. **Variability Analysis:** Understanding sources and impacts of uncertainty

### Healthcare Operations Characteristics
- **Service nature:** Cannot inventory "procedures"
- **High variability:** Patient conditions, procedure times, arrival patterns
- **Multiple resources:** Physicians, nurses, rooms, equipment
- **Quality implications:** Patient safety and satisfaction
- **Regulatory environment:** Compliance and standards

### Queuing Theory Fundamentals
- **Little's Law:** L = ŒªW (Items in system = Arrival rate √ó Wait time)
- **Utilization:** œÅ = Œª/Œº (Arrival rate / Service rate)
- **Queue length:** Expected number waiting
- **Wait time:** Expected delay before service begins

## Case Analysis Framework

### PATA Background
- **Purpose:** Pre-admission testing for surgical patients
- **Patient flow:** Registration ‚Üí Nursing ‚Üí Physician ‚Üí Departure
- **Resources:** Nurses, physicians, examination rooms
- **Performance issues:** Long patient wait times, system inefficiency

### Process Flow Analysis
The provided process flow diagram shows:
1. **Patient arrivals** at scheduled appointment times
2. **Registration process** 
3. **Nursing assessment** (vital signs, medical history)
4. **Physician evaluation** (physical exam, clearance)
5. **Administrative completion** and departure

### Given Data Analysis
- **Input rates:** Patient arrival patterns
- **Processing rates:** Time requirements for each step
- **Resource availability:** Number of nurses, physicians, rooms
- **Performance metrics:** Current wait times and utilization

## Graded Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Bottleneck Analysis
**Prompt:** Use capacity analysis tools (build-up diagrams or/and queuing) to decide if and where there is a bottleneck in the clinic. If a bottleneck does indeed exist, how long do patients wait as a result of the bottleneck?

**Analysis Framework:**
- Calculate capacity at each process step
- Compare capacity to demand (arrival rate)
- Identify the constraining resource
- Apply queuing formulas to estimate wait times
- Assume all appointment slots filled and on-time arrivals

### Question 2: Task Force Diagnosis Evaluation
**Prompt:** Evaluate the three Task Force diagnoses: not enough time between appointments, not enough rooms, not enough physicians. Are these diagnoses valid? If so, are they primary contributors to long patient wait times?

**Analysis Approach:**
- Test each hypothesis against calculated bottlenecks
- Determine if diagnosis addresses actual constraint
- Assess magnitude of impact on wait times
- Consider interaction effects between constraints

### Question 3: Variability Analysis  
**Prompt:** What factors contribute to variability in PATA process flow and what control, if any, does the clinic have to eliminate it?

**Sources of Variability:**
- **Arrival variability:** Late patients, no-shows, early arrivals
- **Service time variability:** Patient complexity, physician efficiency
- **Resource variability:** Staff availability, room availability
- **External factors:** Emergency interruptions, equipment issues

**Control Strategies:**
- **Demand-side:** Appointment scheduling, patient preparation
- **Supply-side:** Staffing policies, process standardization
- **Buffer management:** Capacity cushions, flexible resources

### Question 4: Improvement Recommendations
**Prompt:** What changes would you recommend to improve PATA?

**Recommendation Categories:**
1. **Capacity changes:** Staffing levels, resource allocation
2. **Process redesign:** Flow improvements, task reallocation  
3. **Scheduling optimization:** Appointment timing, patient mix
4. **Variability reduction:** Standardization, buffer management
5. **Information systems:** Real-time tracking, communication

## Quantitative Analysis Tools

### Build-up Diagram Construction
1. Plot demand over time (arrival pattern)
2. Plot available capacity over time
3. Identify periods where demand exceeds capacity
4. Calculate cumulative gap (queue buildup)

### Queuing Calculations
- **M/M/1 Queue:** Single server, exponential arrivals and service
- **M/M/c Queue:** Multiple servers
- **Expected wait time:** W = œÅ/(Œº(1-œÅ)) for M/M/1
- **Expected queue length:** L = ŒªW

### Performance Metrics
- **Average wait time:** Time from arrival to service start
- **Cycle time:** Total time in system
- **Utilization rates:** Resource busy time / Available time
- **Throughput:** Patients served per time period

## Healthcare Service Operations Context

### Unique Challenges
- **Variability amplification:** Uncertainty compounds through process steps
- **Service quality:** Patient experience and medical outcomes
- **Cost pressures:** Efficiency vs. access trade-offs
- **Regulatory compliance:** Safety and quality standards

### Improvement Strategies
- **Lean principles:** Waste elimination, flow optimization
- **Six Sigma:** Variation reduction, quality improvement  
- **Capacity pooling:** Flexible resources, cross-training
- **Technology:** EMR integration, real-time tracking

## Key Takeaways
- **Strategic Message:** Process analysis, particularly managing variability in arrivals and service times, is critical for identifying and alleviating bottlenecks in service operations to reduce customer wait times.

- **Queuing Insights:** Small increases in utilization can cause disproportionate increases in wait times.

- **Healthcare Operations:** Service operations require balancing efficiency, quality, and access in highly variable environments.
