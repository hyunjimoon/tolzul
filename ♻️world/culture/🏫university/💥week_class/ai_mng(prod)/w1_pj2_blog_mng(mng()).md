our goal is constructing managing a tool for managing. project forms this end-goal as a process which require clear 1. definition (bits), 2. benchmarks (atoms) 3. start-end date, 4. measure. example is as below:
- [[#1. def|1. def]]
	- [[#1. def#1.1. in|1.1. in]]
	- [[#1. def#1.2. out|1.2. out]]
- [[#1.2. dynamic def|1.2. dynamic def]]
	- [[#1.2. dynamic def#1.2.1. initial|1.2.1. initial]]
	- [[#1.2. dynamic def#1.2.2. updating algorithm|1.2.2. updating algorithm]]
- [[#2. benchmark|2. benchmark]]
	- [[#2. benchmark#2.1. static exterior|2.1. static exterior]]
	- [[#2. benchmark#2.2. dynamic exterior|2.2. dynamic exterior]]
- [[#3. start-end date|3. start-end date]]

## 1. def
### 1.1. in 
1.1.1. raw files (~35k objects (`.md`, `.png`) and their link) presented in amoon.world website
1.1.2. motivation of Charlie and Angie's continuous improvement (15.785, 15.s10)
1.1.3. hierarchy of suppliers: charlie, sergey, angie (+? loredana )
1.1.3. alpha (project participants) and beta testers (class students) - gamma=selection of students?

### 1.2. out
2.1. process and organization for constructing "operations for entrepreneur" community
2.2. product that solves their problem 
	- who are they? need hierarchy (concentric circles): 15.785 students
	- is it solved problem (state) or problem solving (process)? if latter, our product seeks optimal allocation on bit + atom supply and voice of customer to maximize "user satisfaction + effectiveness + efficiency"

## 1.2. dynamic def
### 1.2.1. initial
- first blog can be on clockspeed, focusing on: 
	- charlie: elegant degradation (interesting there is a difference between [elegant degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegant_degradation) and [graceful degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance)), 
	- angie: elaborate on alpha, beta, gamma 
	- difference between descriptive and prescriptive, summarizing some contents

### 1.2.2. updating algorithm
-  [[ðŸŒ’2ðŸŒ˜ research rhythm in six steps]]

## 2. benchmark
### 2.1. static exterior 
up: documents may be more structured (e.g. planned city)
down: lower visibility on entire database
- [entrepreneurial-strategy.net](https://www.entrepreneurial-strategy.net/) (Scott, Erin, Joshua)
- google.com
- [insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)

### 2.2. dynamic exterior 
up: feeling of being part of change, motivation for comments - need to set periods
down: 
- datacolada.org, datacolada.org/toc
- [metasd.com](https://metasd.com/) (Tom),  editor's pick in [[do_both_from_metasd]]
- [statistical modeling, causal inference, social science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) (Andrew), role of blog in idea manufacturing, analyzed with make + buy decision in [[gelman_auto(b)]]

## 3. start-end date
- start: summer (first blog until the end of July)
- end: test run - two years from now, finalizing in a publishable book as described in [[ðŸŒ’2ðŸŒ˜ research rhythm in six steps]]

## 4.measure
- number of blogs (esp. diagrams)
- number of comments
- number and heterogeneity of feedback providers, perhaps measured by job domain classification, e.g. [[hierarchical data structure of agency]]

## 5. features
- backlog of blogs and select when to publish (wordpress can checkbox publish/unpublish, set publishing date)
- member access
