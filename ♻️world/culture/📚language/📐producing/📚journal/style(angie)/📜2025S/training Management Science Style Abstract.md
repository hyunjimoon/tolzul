|**Paragraph**|**Role (Rhetorical Function)**|
|---|---|
|1|**🖼️ Context** – Entrepreneurship often involves navigating a complex web of stakeholders—customers, investors, regulators—whose buy-in is crucial for a venture's success. Introduces the challenge of stakeholder management in entrepreneurship and highlights the difficulty of prioritizing actions under resource constraints and uncertainty.|
|2|**💭 Gap/Problem Identification** – There is a pressing practical need—and a theoretical gap—for a framework that helps entrepreneurs decide which actions to take, and when, in order to maximize cumulative stakeholder acceptance across the venture's development stages. Establishes the need for a systematic framework to address entrepreneurial action prioritization.|
|3|**📐 Approach (Model Setup)** – To address this problem, we propose an inventory management perspective on entrepreneurial action prioritization. Introduces the core modeling approach treating stakeholder acceptance as inventory state variables and entrepreneurial actions as decisions that affect these stocks.|
|4|**📐 Approach (Formulation)** – We formulate this as a stochastic control problem, where the entrepreneur updates their beliefs about stakeholder reactions (success probabilities, magnitudes of impact) as outcomes from each action emerge. Describes the technical formulation as a stochastic control problem with Bayesian learning components.|
|5|**📜 Literature Review (Bayesian Entrepreneurship)** – Our approach contributes to and bridges three streams of literature. Begins literature review by connecting to Bayesian entrepreneurship literature, highlighting how the work extends existing models to multi-dimensional stakeholder learning.|
|6|**📜 Literature Review (Operations Management)** – Second, we draw on inventory management theory in operations management, particularly as it has been applied to innovation and entrepreneurship contexts. Reviews operations management and inventory theory applications to entrepreneurship, drawing parallels between inventory control and stakeholder management.|
|7|**📜 Literature Review (Entrepreneurship Theory)** – Third, our framework relates to classic entrepreneurship theories that highlight how entrepreneurs interact with their environment and stakeholders. Connects the approach to foundational entrepreneurship theories including effectuation, stakeholder theory, and entrepreneurial bricolage.|
|8|**💸 Contributions (Introduction)** – In this paper, we introduce a novel formal model of entrepreneurial action prioritization under uncertainty, treating stakeholder acceptance levels as state variables. Introduces the paper's contributions and novelty in bridging entrepreneurship and operations management through formal modeling.|
|9|**💸 Contributions (Model & Solution)** – **First contribution:** We address an important gap by bridging entrepreneurship and operations management theories. Details the first contribution of creating a finite-horizon dynamic programming formulation that yields threshold-like policies for optimal action sequencing.|
|10|**💸 Contributions (Optimal Policy Characterization)** – **Second contribution:** We characterize the optimal prioritization strategy and uncover how it responds to changes in the venture's state. Describes the second contribution of characterizing optimal policies that balance exploitation and exploration across stakeholder domains.|
|11|**💸 Contributions (Insights & Implications)** – **Third contribution:** Our analysis yields actionable insights and theoretical implications. Presents the third contribution of deriving actionable insights about maintaining balanced stakeholder portfolios and strategic trade-offs.|
|12|**📝 Outline** – In the remainder of the paper, we formally develop and analyze the model. Provides a detailed outline of the paper's remaining sections including model development, analysis, extensions, and conclusions.|

This paper examines how a ﬁrm’s choice of the type of experiment impacts on its potential exploitation of new technological opportunities. It does so in the context of the failure of successful ﬁrms (or disruption) where the literature has informally suggested that ﬁrms undertake errors in experimental choice. It is shown that ﬁrms will generically choose experiments that minimize false positives (a high-bar) or minimize false negatives (a lowbar) rather than strike a balance between the two. This is done to better inform decisions regarding the exploitation of technological opportunities. It is shown that these choices can differ between incumbents and entrants based on their fundamentals and because of the anticipation of competition between them.

Early stage entrepreneurs face a critical decision: when to focus on customer development versus supplier capability building. Sequencing errors destroy billions in capital—Webvan's $1 billion waste and Better Place's $850M loss represent systematic failures from building without demand validation. Three root causes drive this: entrepreneurs lack rigorous frameworks, operate under extreme uncertainty, and navigate interdependent ecosystems where stakeholders wait for others to commit. We address each through targeted solutions: modeling stakeholder acceptance as measurable state variables provides analytical structure, newsvendor optimization handles uncertainty through probability-weighted costs, and interdependence modeling resolves coordination barriers. Entrepreneurs solve this using our critical ratio r = Cu/(Cu + Co), where Cu represents underage costs (selling without delivery capability) and Co represents overage costs (building without demand). The method is straightforward: calculate industry-specific cost parameters, determine demand distributions, then apply the decision rule—when r > 0.5, prioritize suppliers first; when r < 0.5, prioritize customers first. This transforms entrepreneurial decision-making from intuitive to systematic, preventing billion-dollar sequencing disasters.
