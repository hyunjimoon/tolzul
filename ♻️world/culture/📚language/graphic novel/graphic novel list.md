Below is a set of graphic‑novel “field texts” I would load onto my Kindle if I were the Ph.D. student behind _The Promise Vendor: Entrepreneurial Over‑promise as Rational Strategy_. I group them by the kind of research intuition they can catalyze and, for each, flag one or more “orbit hooks” you can mine:

| #                                                           | Title & Creators                                                  | Why it rewards an entrepreneurial‑Bayesian read                                                                                                                                                                                      | Orbit hooks*            |

A living lab for **charismatic commitment devices** and posterior “truth revelation” under radical uncertainty. | producing ⟷ evaluating  |
| 2                                                           | **_The Black Monday Murders_** – Jonathan Hickman & Tom Coker     | Finance is literal blood‑magic; bargains resemble SAFEs with occult contingencies. Forces you to model information asymmetry when valuation depends on hidden state variables.                                                       | theorising              |

Shows how **vertical integration choices** (in‑house “Crush” production vs. black‑market outsourcing) map onto delay‑vs‑cost trade‑offs—exactly your supply‑chain node problem.    | producing               |

Superb allegory for **non‑stationary priors and exploration–exploitation tension**.   | theorising ⟷ evaluating |
| 6                                                           | **_The Incal_** – Alejandro Jodorowsky & Moebius                  | A reluctant courier inherits a McGuffin that different factions value inconsistently; promises are renegotiated at galactic scale.

| 7                                                           | **_The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl_** – Ryan North & Erica Henderson | Doreen beats cosmic‑level threats with gumption, memes, and cheap heuristics—textbook **resource‑rationality**. Episodes often end with a reality‑check Bayesian update: the easiest path was to talk, not fight.                    | producing               |
| 8                                                           | **_Hawkeye: My Life as a Weapon_** – Matt Fraction & David Aja    | Clint Barton juggles landlord duties, mob threats, and Avenger gigs on a shoestring. Illuminates **bounded‑budget prioritisation** and “fail cheaply” experimentation.                                                               | producing               |

Useful for modelling **commitment under imperfect information** and the psychological cost of strategic misrepresentation. | evaluating              |

A historical sandbox for posterior regret analysis.                                                                    | theorising ⟷ producing  |

### How to harvest insight systematically

1. **Map characters to decision variables.** Treat each promise or pivot as a node in a dynamic Bayesian network; trace how new evidence shifts their policy.
    
2. **Annotate over‑promises.** Mark speeches or deals where a protagonist commits beyond available resources. Ask: _what posterior probability would justify that leap?_
    
3. **Run light‑weight coding exercises.** After each volume, sketch a Stan or NumPyro toy model that captures one strategic dilemma you observed (e.g., salvage‑orbital debris vs. build‑new‑ship in _Planetes_). Parameterise priors with plausible real‑world data.
    
4. **Three‑orbit reflection.** Close every reading session by jotting:
    
    - _Outer_: What normative theory is implied?
        
    - _Middle_: What design/operational move mirrors it in your Gen‑based spreadsheet model?
        
    - _Inner_: How would a founder feel after acting on that move?

### A note on the classics list you found

Your shortlist already includes gems like **_Planetes_**, **_Vinland Saga_**, **_Kill or be Killed_**, and **_Akira_**—all highly compatible with the research lenses above.

**Next step**  
Pick one title from each bloc, interleave them with your modelling sprints, and treat the exercise as qualitative “scenario priors” generation. Over a semester you’ll accrue a miniature ethnography of strategic over‑promise in fictional worlds, ready to be formalised in your dissertation’s Bayesian entrepreneurship chapter.
