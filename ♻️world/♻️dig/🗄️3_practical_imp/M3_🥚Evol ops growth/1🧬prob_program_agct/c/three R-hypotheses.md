### Three main themes
1. <font color  = "skyblue">belief_t</font> affects <font color  = "#C0A0C0">observation_t</font>: what to observe depends on the choice which cell (product x market) to experiment with

2. <font color  = "skyblue">belief_t</font> and <font color  = "#C0A0C0">observation_t</font> together affects <font color  = "red">action_t</font>: the same profitability observation can be interpreted as either signal to scale or pivot product or pivot market depending on agents's belief grid (function of predicted profitability and credible interval around it (mu +- k sigma)

3. <font color  = "red">action_t</font> affects update mechanism from <font color  = "skyblue">belief_t</font> to <font color  = "skyblue">belief_{t+1}</font> : <font color  = "red">pivot product action</font> holds <font color  = "#C0A0C0">market belief </font> equal and updates <font color  = "#green"> product belief</font>.  <font color  = "red">pivot market action</font> holds market belief equal and updates product belief.


####  2. input of hypotheses
R1: $\hat{\mu}_{bc-}^0=\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0 - \hat{\mu}_{cd}^0$  , $\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0 = \hat{\mu_b}^0 - \mu_b^0$  , $\hat{\mu_{cd}}^0 = \hat{\mu_c}^0 - \mu_c^0$
R2: $\hat{\mu}_{bc+}^0 = \hat{\mu}_{bd}^0 + \hat{\mu}_{cd}^0$
R3: $k, \sigma$
For startup's experimentation and pivoting decisions, $\hat{\mu}_{bc-}^0$ represents the difference between the startup's beliefs about the potential of the product ($\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0$) and the market ($\hat{\mu_{cd}}^0$) at the initial time point (t=0). Specifically, $\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0$ is the difference between the startup's belief about the gap between two product's profitability ($\hat{\mu_b}^0$) and the actual gap between the two profitability ($\mu_b^0$), while $\hat{\mu_{cd}}^0$ is the difference between the believed gap of market profitability ($\hat{\mu_c}^0$) and the actual gap of market profitability ($\mu_c^0$). On the other hand, $\hat{\mu}_{bc+}^0$ is the sum of $\hat{\mu_{bd}}^0$ and $\hat{\mu_{cd}}^0$, representing the combined belief about the potential of the product and market. The parameters k and $\sigma$ relate to the startup's decision-making thresholds, where k is a scaling factor that affects decision rule and $\sigma$ represents the uncertainty in profitability. The startup will pivot the product when the observed profitability falls between $\mu - k\sigma$ (low bar) and $\mu + k\sigma$ (high bar), and will pivot the market when the observed profitability is lower than low bar and scale when higher than high bar.

#### 3.output of hypotheses
R ($\in 0, 1, \infty$) is ratio of <font color  = "green">pivot product</font>  to  <font color  = "#C0A0C0">pivot market</font> given two experiment opportunity.
