For cheap and cutting-edge curation #3C, abstracting the gap between management and probablistic model, probablistic model to computation is necessary. 

There is a gap between pure probablistic and prob. computational model which is ignored by many. The modeling happens within modeling which is why SBC cannot catch model misspecification as it only uses the data it generated from the given model. However, this can be improved by combining real data.

Geometric prior terms error that learning algorithm can have as inductive error and classifies into three: approximation, optimization, and statistical. Approximation error decrease as representation function space increases, while statistical error decrease as hypothesis space increases i.e. the number of sample increases.
