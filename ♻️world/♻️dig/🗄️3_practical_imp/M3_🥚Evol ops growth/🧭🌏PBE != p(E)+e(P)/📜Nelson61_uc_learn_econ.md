| I | **The Choice among Alternative Means** | When developing new technology with uncertain outcomes, choosing a single path early may be suboptimal. Early testing with small investments can improve estimation accuracy. | N/A |
| II | **The Model** | Consists of several key components: | |
| II.A | **Uncertainty, Learning, and the Time Path of Estimates** | Estimates improve as development proceeds, with uncertainty decreasing over time | E(êt - C)² > E(êt+θ - C)² |
| II.B | **The Optimum Number to Run in Parallel** | Framework for determining optimal number of parallel projects based on cost-benefit tradeoff | E(C)n = (n - 1)Mθ + EnminCi,t+θ |
| II.C | **A Simple Numerical Example** | Practical application showing how to calculate optimal parallel paths considering both time and cost | E(T)n = T₂Pⁿ + T₁(1 - Pⁿ) |
| III | **Some Implications for Efficient R&D Management** | Technical advances sought are large, early prototype testing informative, prototype costs small vs total costs, strategy requires limited early commitments | E(Ct - C)² = E(Ct - Ct+θ)² + E(Ct+θ - C)² |
| IV | **Broader Normative and Positive Implications** | Analysis splits into two major implications: | |
| IV.A | **Multiple Decision Making Units, Multiple Inventions** | Multiple simultaneous inventions by different firms may be economically efficient | ΔnE(C) = Mθ + (M₂ - M₁)(Pⁿ - Pⁿ⁻¹) |
| IV.B | **Economies of Scale in R and D** | Large labs have advantages in pursuing optimal number of parallel paths | E(C*)n = (n - 1)Mθ + [C₂*Pⁿ + C₁*(1 - Pⁿ)] |

**Final Summary:**
The paper provides a mathematical framework for analyzing parallel R&D strategies, demonstrating that:

1. Cost function: E(C)n = (n - 1)Mθ + EnminCi,t+θ
2. Time function: E(T)n = T₂Pⁿ + T₁(1 - Pⁿ)
3. Learning/uncertainty relation: E(Ct - C)² = E(Ct - Ct+θ)² + E(Ct+θ - C)²

Where:
- n = number of parallel projects
- Mθ = cost per project during competition period
- P = probability of project being in class II
- T₁,T₂ = development times for different project classes
- C = actual cost
- êt = estimate at time t

This mathematical framework helps explain both firm-level R&D strategies and broader patterns in technological development, showing how parallel development can be optimal despite apparent redundancy.
