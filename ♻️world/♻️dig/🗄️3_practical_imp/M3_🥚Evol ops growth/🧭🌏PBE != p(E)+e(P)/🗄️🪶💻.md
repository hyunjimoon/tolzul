it's better to run shorter chains in parallel rather than a few long chains, when you have high uncertainty in how sampler is converging to target distribution ([cld1](https://claude.ai/chat/98116811-5abb-4380-8dba-57cce33027ce))


1. For exaptation vs adaptation from Buss's paper:

| Aspect | Adaptation | Exaptation |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Origin | Selected for current function | Co-opted for new function |
| Process | Direct optimization | Opportunistic repurposing |
| Time Frame | Gradual refinement | Rapid discovery of new uses |
| Selection Pressure | Continuous for specific purpose | Not initially selected for current use |
| Change Pattern | Incremental improvements | Sudden functional shifts |

2. From the MCMC paper about short vs long chains:

| Aspect | Long Sequential Chains | Short Parallel Chains |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Warmup Cost | Fixed per chain | Linear with chains |
| Hardware Utilization | Limited parallelism | Better GPU/TPU usage |
| Sample Independence | High autocorrelation | Lower correlation between chains |
| Convergence Detection | Needs long runs (R̂) | Can use nested R̂ for early detection |
| Effectiveness | Better for known distributions | Better for high uncertainty |

1. "high bar : low bar = sequential : parallel approach" (keep as is)
2. "gradual refinement : sudden discovery = adaptation : exaptation" 
3. "known convergence : unknown convergence = long sequential : short parallel"

The key insight is that parallel approaches excel when:
- There's high uncertainty about the target state/distribution
- Quick exploration of multiple possibilities is needed
- Hardware allows efficient parallel execution
- We need to discover unexpected uses/properties
