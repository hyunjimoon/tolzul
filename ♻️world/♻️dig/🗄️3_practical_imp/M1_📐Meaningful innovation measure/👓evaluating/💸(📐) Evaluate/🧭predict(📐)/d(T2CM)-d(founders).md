| DR (Market Stability)                | Duo may prefer a more stable market to reduce coordination costs and disagreements between founders. A stable market allows for more predictable decision making.                                                                          | Duo may be more willing to tackle dynamic markets because they can divide and conquer, with each founder focusing on different changing aspects. Duo has more total cognitive bandwidth to process a dynamic environment.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SR (Market Size)                     | Duo may prefer to target a smaller market initially to prove their business model with fewer resources. Starting small also reduces the risk of conflict between founders.                                                                 | Duo may target larger markets from the start because they have more combined resources, connections and credibility than a solo founder. Larger markets provide more opportunities for the founders to pursue different customer segments if needed.                                                                                                                                                   |
| BR (Optimism)                        | Duo may be less optimistic than a very confident solo founder because the duo has to constantly calibrate their expectations with each other, reducing individual over-optimism.                                                           | Duo may be more optimistic than a timid solo founder because the founders can reinforce each other's confidence.<br><br>Having a shared vision can increase the optimism beyond what either founder would have individually. It's unclear if duo would be consistently more or less optimistic than solo. It likely depends on the individual traits of the founders and their interpersonal dynamics. |
| OB (Market Acceptance info)          | Duo may have less information on market acceptance because each founder has limited bandwidth to gather external data while also coordinating internally. Some market information could get lost in the "telephone game" between founders. | Duo likely has more total information on market acceptance because they can tap into two separate networks and have two pairs of eyes and ears open to the market. They can cover more ground in customer discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ER (Experiment Opportunity)          | Duo may have fewer experiment opportunities because some experiments could be vetoed by the other founder. With shared resources, each founder may be more conservative in deploying experiments.                                          | Duo can run more experiments in parallel by dividing and conquering. They also have a larger combined pool of resources and mental bandwidth to deploy a greater number and variety of experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| CT (Market-Product Confidence Ratio) | Duo may have a lower ratio (relatively more confidence in product than market) because the founders reinforce each other's confidence in their own product. Overconfidence in one's own product is a common pitfall.                       | Duo may have a higher ratio (relatively more confidence in market than product) because they can do more market research and the Product Confidence gets divided across two founders' visions. Reaching agreement provides a check against Product overconfidence.                                                                                                                                     |

Note: The principles in the second column (Marr's Three Levels in Investment) can be applied to both the first column (Computational Rationality) and the third column (Three-Level Pivots). For example, the perceiving, probabilistic reasoning, and planning steps can be used to break down and analyze both the utility maximization problem in computational rationality and the pivot evaluation process in the three-level pivots approach.
