# ♻️ World - How World Affects Me

The world cycles experiences through me via four channels:

## Subfolders
- **body/** - Physical activities (tennis, swimming, exercise, food)
- **people/** - Social observations and classifications  
- **time/** - Periodic notes (year → quarter → month → week → day)
- **culture/** - External inputs (film, music, language, art)

## Purpose
♻️ represents continuous recycling of experience into understanding. Everything here is input that shapes who I become.
