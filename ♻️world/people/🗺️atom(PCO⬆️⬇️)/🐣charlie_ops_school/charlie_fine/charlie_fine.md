ed anderson's perception of charlie (is known for): quality, game theory, flexible manufacturing, sd and simulation friendly, big thinker

Logical response based [this slide](https://0599faed.streaklinks.com/CgRZ_A87u3K1EACPoQGH-25i/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffi%2Fxe5pqswtcofsw4tdxf9xs%2FAngie25_promise-vendor.pdf%3Frlkey%3Dl00zuav8n5o1j5hiakca7pr1r%26dl%3D0) is to over promise -- _I'll make Charlie and Scott crazy🔥, not excited._

But emotionally, I can only think of thanking you. I was struggling with homesickness and learning your excitement prevented burnout.

Dear Charlie,
"First fall in love with your advisor, then find your research question" is the best advice i chose to follow.
Thanks for being my intrinsic motivation, Charlie

hi charlie,
i'm reaching out to clarify and rationalize what i mean by "don't tell scott and moshe that i follow their advice to get investment".

clarify
i don't have any intention to hide this from them. as their (and your) time and effort investment is a "risk" to me when calculating risk-return ratio, i'm formulating an easy way to communicate this idea (which is being freshly developed based on BE reading group + chat with you + vikash's seminar).

the faster we acknowledge we're the prisoner of our perception, the more chance we can escape from the prison (although we never will).

rationalize
my ex-post rationalization is, when i faced with the binary choice of follow (accept) or not follow (reject) the advice, i calculate the uncertainty ratio. 

this is common in MCMC (metropolis hastings) algorithm to sample from posterior distribution (we use sampling as denominator marginal likelihood is intractable, but we can evaluate the ratio of posterior distribution's value of one sample) 

if the proposed posterior is higher we accept, if lower we reject with some probability - i call this ignorance prior meaning the more i don't know about it, i assign higher probability on going against my judgement.


of learn the weight of uncertainty in my mental model (uc1) and the uncertainty in advice-provider's mental model (uc2) to decide my next action (argmin_(a in A) (w1 * uc1 + w2 * uc2) analytical reason behind why i mostly follow your advice is i learned you iterate more before sharing your thought. everyone has their style.

gave feedback that introduction includes construction of the paper so why don't i compare the introduction only. updated model to methodology and [[⚙️(🗄️📝)]]
