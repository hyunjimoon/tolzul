Interests:
-  bringing more rigorous estimation methods and tools into system dynamics
-  solving the challenges in applying those methods in the scales needed in practice
-  behavior dynamics, strategy project

- dynamic modeling to complex organizational problems. He has analyzed how organizations learn in the presence of delays between taking action and observing the results, and has shown through empirical data and simulations the learning challenges in such contexts. His strategy research has explored capability development tradeoffs under competition and erosion of organizational capabilities through adaptation traps. 
-  public health problems, including obesity dynamics, comparing different modeling methodologies in application to epidemics, and agent-based modeling of polio transmission dynamics.

- expanding the system dynamics modeling toolbox through advancing parameter estimation and validation methods for dynamic models.
- published in Management Science, Organization Science, Epidemiology and Infection, International Journal of Obesity, and System Dynamics Review.
- reviewer for over 20 NIH and NSF panels and over a dozen different journals, and his research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and multiple private sector firms

a sharp discontinuity in the optimal organization of work within the range of parameters observed in this setting, with a shift from low paying jobs to good jobs if cost of employee quality could be contained below a threshold. The results point to potential viability of good jobs in low cost services
