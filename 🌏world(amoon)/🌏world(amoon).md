### how amoon organize data stream?
I go through two scaling of learning phase: first is when I replicate the structure of a given document in a diagram. Especially for textbooks, choose a bible textbook (backbone), import or construct structure. Then link knowledge from different documents on this backbone. For instance, from below, green is main textbook (MWG), purple is lecture notes, red is  sub reference (NM). Diagram shows vertical and horizontal links of knowledge card. Following [[color_code]] especially for questions (in blue + tagging who to ask) helps when reviewing the document by jumping through cards and skimming the diagrams.

Second jump is when I re-structure the cards to decrease their distance. This is mostly done by aggregating cards to decrease depth of layers within one hierarchy or linking with other networks. This has the effect of decreasing distance within and between knowledges, hence more cohesive. 

A few more examples.

### need solution fulfillment triplet
JB connected "margin as spaces that should be void and unfinished in order to let new and different people and things to integrate the building. In more digital context term, margin is half-baked or open-source to let anyone play with it and I realized I have been registering information inflow in a way that can be reconfigured to need-solution-fulfillment triplet.
