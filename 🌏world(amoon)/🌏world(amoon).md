### how amoon organize data stream?
I go through two scaling of learning phase: first is when I replicate the structure of a given document in a diagram. Especially for textbooks, choose a bible textbook (backbone), import or construct structure. Then link knowledge from different documents on this backbone. For instance, from below, green is main textbook (MWG), purple is lecture notes, red is  sub reference (NM). Diagram shows vertical and horizontal links of knowledge card. Following [[color_code]] especially for questions (in blue + tagging who to ask) helps when reviewing the document by jumping through cards and skimming the diagrams.

Second jump is when I re-structure the cards to decrease their distance. This is mostly done by aggregating cards to decrease depth of layers within one hierarchy or linking with other networks. This has the effect of decreasing distance within and between knowledges, hence more cohesive. 

A few more examples.

### need solution fulfillment triplet
JB connected "margin as spaces that should be void and unfinished in order to let new and different people and things to integrate the building. In more digital context term, margin is half-baked or open-source to let anyone play with it and I realized I have been registering information inflow in a way that can be reconfigured to need-solution-fulfillment triplet.

This version maintains the theoretical framework while providing specific, concrete examples for each cell. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?
I see - let me help structure this step by step:

1. Looking at the three evolutionary logics (🌱🦅🐠), I find the "Decision Process" and "Probability Structure" rows most helpful because they directly map to sampling strategies:
- Sequential/Fully dependent (Toyota)
- Branching/Partially exchangeable (Tesla/Ford) 
- Parallel/Fully exchangeable (SpaceX)

2. First updating the objects table considering uncertainty levels and sampling strategies:

| Role or Level | Objects             | High Uncertainty (SpaceX)                                                                                                                                                                    | Medium Uncertainty (Tesla/Ford)                                                                                                                           | Low Uncertainty (Toyota)                                                                                            |

This structure shows how higher uncertainty environments require more parallel, exchangeable sampling strategies, while lower uncertainty allows for more sequential, dependent approaches. The sampling strategy effectively matches the uncertainty level of the opportunity.

Let me address this step by step:

1. First, let me fill in the table with the horse racing analogy:
