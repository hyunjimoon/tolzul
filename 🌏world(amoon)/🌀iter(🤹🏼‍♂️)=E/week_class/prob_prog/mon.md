> 1. Is there any measure that includes prior elicitation stage into speed? I feel different models (e.g. prob.prog vs machine learning) would have different ease and depth of prior elicitation.

low-hanging fruit (hand writing, learning them from data) - hybrid (human judge)
give syntehtic data to machine and judge


> 2.  Is it correct each stack has different evolution speed (e.g. generative programs evolve faster than inference programs / software (PyTorch) faster than hardware (cpu, gpu) ? How do you modularize different versions of prob.comp stack for their effective orchestration?

speed of cultural evolution , biological, development (process might operate); may have similar laws under-neath


> 3. What do you mean by “ignorance” prior? (From ignorance prior over prob. Programs)


>4. Are you aware of any example or case-study where developer’s performance jump after learning how to use platform? i.e. empirical evidence for worse (time to climb learning curve of computing stack) than better dynamics?
- product perspective than ui/ux (user studies; document, marginal gain)

> Do neural nets do well for perceiving the 3D scenes if you steer them with facts about objects? Can you do something like the SMC LLM paper you mentioned?

parse the images - using (conditioned that machine is 3d)
parse the image and 
large energy spent (various last mile problems); intellectual debts (inflection point would cross, won't be appealing)
Where is the automatic differentiation in the probabilistic programming framework usually used? Could you give some examples? Thanks!

steering stuff (3d - gradient based)

gradient -based is local (need good surrogate - so fall flat) - (where is backprop in brain - challenging to implement)

> I saw that Intermediate representations were part of the PPL stack. Are there PPL-specific IRs or optimizations that can exploit the model structure as opposed to traditional instruction level optimization?

green field (ir is for higher level language) - one prob. specialized (gen elimination lib, generative code (changing model representation - have larger affect)vs inference code); few years ago (autodiff - ir is for generative code; could design (know what ir (host language complied to it)))

critical (bets ; school - empowered to challenge the bets); critical of the environment + economic play would fold differently - convergence (both profit and nonprofit - governance to be useful in different setting - big tech has reasons to prefer neural network(price capture) - leading edge of the field was industry settings - prob.prog - substantially cheaper (2~3 for same robustness) - number of entities to participate / scrutinize)

- time series used (resampled us seq. mc); selection
- infinite timeseries (hypothesis space is infinite - sample time series ; optimal )
- posterior (ignorance priors are diff from greedily)
- consensus prior (oncology) - 3d paper 
rc car with prob.prog (drives lot slower (policy is saying much slower)) - verification effort

> (James Sum) Within the realm of 3D vision perception in urban settings, how do probabilistic approaches address depth estimation errors introduced by occlusions from moving vehicles and pedestrians, and have there been advancements made in combining probabilistic graphical models with convolutional neural networks to refine these depth maps?


> (Lulu Ito) How important is it to be dedicated in the brain structure to get a better result?
