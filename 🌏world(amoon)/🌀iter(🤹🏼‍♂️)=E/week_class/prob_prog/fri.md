slack channel will be on?

- one of the settings (chisight - 3d human ; jim, bill freeman, josh,  - pairing with psychophysic); doesn't confabulate (not all domains, as accurately as domain)
- mind and brain + fundamental limits bf embark on
- scaling route is the following: beautiful (microscopic structure - digital logic to trillion of steps with low failure rate - all the up to software ecology / in 30 yrs)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825131152.png]]
- possibility that basic ingredient to change the history is here(natural - how intelligent agent can scale)
- 5yr time scale - early prototype of chiexpertise - open for any feedback (profound risk)
- military and drones (no way to improve science wo getting risk)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825131511.png]]
- at least as important (sci, not tech)![[Pasted image 20230825131823.png]]

- how rational are we and where can machine help?
- reverse engineering the first 1k-ms of perception (medical intervention - assist ppl understand what they do right or wrong - perceptual rationality, not cognitive rationality)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132113.png]]
- goerge matheos - biological 
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132201.png]]
- write ppl in gen, compile to network neuron, biological neurons are clocked
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132238.png]]
- how is it even possible? "brain-like" real time inference can happen
- quantitative, gamma rythin (90hz) vs theta? (4hr)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132435.png]]
- images of cortex highlighting its layer (broadly reported - comes in thru 4th layer)
- cortex is more like firmware (locally re-program and simulate much / relative to indirec simulation)can not software
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132523.png]]
- biophysically implementation![[Pasted image 20230825132819.png]]
- wet lab facility - to differenciate btw disambiguity
- ![[Pasted image 20230825132852.png]]
- real prediction correlation (most right: randomly permute)![[Pasted image 20230825132931.png]]
- topologically sorting the graphical and assign to layer 4 and canonical  (4-> 2,3 -> 5,6) 
- can follow the loop from ![[Pasted image 20230825133421.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230825133442.png]]
- diagnal is strongest ![[Pasted image 20230825133521.png]]
- errors in allen projection atlas
- ![[Pasted image 20230825133612.png]]
- andrew bolton - injection (lp is too coarsely labeled - reverse loop) ![[Pasted image 20230825133626.png]]
- no bug after correcting the confound ![[Pasted image 20230825133654.png]]
- poisson process is so fast and simple (independent from what model is)
- happy to verify
1. theory (facts from ) - disconnected facts
2. instance of how theory corrected the data - c.e.g. of theory abandon us, data save us
estimating the state of the world (not decision; what actions!!! - sequential mc and control) -particle weights go to brain region where dopamin region 
- multiplication (expected reward) - weights go to exact right place !!!
- ways to test theorys on how drugs interfer
![[Pasted image 20230825134106.png]]
micro circuits for rolling dice (prob.prog. caught on more)
- inference meta programming : automating (restricted - good time series, chiexperties) + ai/cognition complete (Think flexibly); sgd of large network (generic but non-economic)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825135308.png]]
- better automation for us to (orders of 10s written dsl - church - continuation fit into the  - Tom night computer engineer; need at least a few hundreds before worrying about continuation)

1.  statistical abstracts (arguments could be supported by data)
2. causes of malnutrition - couldn't even meta-agree whether they agree or disagree (factionalized camps) - micro data with 4milion (pharma, best university; too easy to poke holes)
- system causal knowledge and data in the speed of human thoughts

- ![[Pasted image 20230825140246.png]]
- I only believe in stats that I doctored myself - why is sth interesting (reasoning and sampling bias) - what if this theta (biased by certaink - how biased would the data have to be - till the assumptions get falsified) 
- there are zones for much more debat
- empirical questions they could be asked - implications in clinical research process ![[Pasted image 20230825140857.png]]

- automation and scaling (cs approach)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825141124.png]]
- tradeoff (~ simple, general, accuracy)
- freer (mit) , Dan roy (toronto), ackerman, ![[Pasted image 20230825141243.png]]
- independent noise +  bounded density -> computable (organizim managed to learn from data)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825141504.png]]
- system level automation ![[Pasted image 20230825141517.png]]
- no control on error (only by accident they; don't control prob. of failure - engineering and equity issue when they are used broad)
- pretty general domain  (Circumscribe - automate generate)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825141722.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230825141908.png]]
- NOT know exact posterior but "can sample arbitraily well calibrated"
- ![[Pasted image 20230825142032.png]]
- if you have prior then bi is slow - backwards (수도 marginal is faster than determinstic than stoch alg)
- ![[Pasted image 20230825142208.png]]

- long incubation process (more ) - supporting qualified (founding thesis )
