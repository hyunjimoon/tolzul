### ready mentee, what can mentor do?

### slow writer, what can mentor do?


### ethical issues

- disclosing errors
- authorship, credit
- improving vs manipulating image
- list ethical issues up front (record keeping)
- incentive structure within a lab (collaboration) VS data
#talk "can i see whether i can reiterate that?"

- reason why we feel uncomfortable in romantic relationship: can't address (other people's agency and emotion while) - 

know your comfortableness

- distressful, inform professor 
- unit testing (fuller picture of what happened) discard anything (asking for input)
- experiments might
- don't assume correctness of data, before validating from end to end - one of the mentee forgot to remix (physically there to be there)


need discussion on authorship and how to evaluate novel ideas

### promoting professional development
