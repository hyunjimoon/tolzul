i'm asking for [[matt_cronin]]'s advice on:

naming issues

| Prefer "Executed Body" | Prefer "Implemented Body" |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| - Strategy scholars | - Software developers |
| - Entrepreneurs/founders | - Project managers |
| - Business executives | - Systems engineers |
| - Management consultants | - Technical architects |
| - Venture capitalists | - Operations researchers |
| - Business school faculty | - Process engineers |
| - Leadership coaches | - Quality assurance professionals |

Key pattern: "Executed" resonates with strategic/business-focused audiences, while "Implemented" appeals to technical/process-oriented audiences.

planning for a chat with matt

1. set angie's goal as making one pager with three paragraphs below. 
2. first paragraph
	1. first sentence summarizes what angie and matt has been developing (synthesizing [[🧠👁️🤜scientist_artist_judge]] with knowledge production chain)
	2. second introduce angie's goal of chat (get feedback on naming for a model that will be presented in complex adaptive system conference paper, collaborating with charlie and evolutionary psychologist). share how this connects with angie's ultimate vision on bridging bayesian and evolutionary entrepreneurship
	3. third explains the future composition: second paragraph explains [[🔄UTB_understanding-theory-body]] model, third paragraph explains three concrete questions (naming, connection with meehl, open question (impression and rooms for improvement))
3. second paragraph: summarize [[🔄UTB_understanding-theory-body]]  as if you're explaining this to [[🧠👁️🤜scientist_artist_judge]] author. 
	1. With [[Cronin_SAJ.pdf]]'s lens, our system dynamics model reveals three foundational pairings that drive innovation through distinct collaborative processes and their products. The Artist-Scientist collaboration (👁️→🧠) enables discovery and possibility through testing processes, where imagination of potential truths combines with scientific verification to uncover previously unknown aspects of situations. This process manifests in our model's testing cycle, where perceptive understanding leads to programmatic theory development. The Scientist-Judge pairing (🧠→🤜) creates skill and meaning through implementing processes, where scientific understanding of how situations operate combines with judicial evaluation of costs and benefits to enable effective goal achievement. This emerges in our model's implementing cycle from programmatic theory to strategic framework. The Judge-Artist pairing (🤜→👁️) generates vision and hope through receiving feedback, where evaluation of current realities combines with imagination of better futures to motivate pursuit of goals despite uncertainty. This manifests in our model's feedback cycle connecting strategic framework back to perceptive understanding. Each pairing produces both an immediate output (discovery, skill, vision) and a deeper foundation (possibility, meaning, hope) that shapes how organizations navigate innovation landscapes.
4. third paragraph: 
	1. Naming: 1) Programmatic vs Integrative Theory, 2) Strategic commitment vs framework (Kuhn), 3) Refine loop, 4) use of the word hypothesis?
	2. connecting with meehl (TH) and understand the feedback loop (epigenetic, intertemporal uncertainty, risk vs uncertainty)
