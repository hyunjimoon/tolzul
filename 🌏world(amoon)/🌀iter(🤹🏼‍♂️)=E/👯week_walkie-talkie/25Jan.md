| Component              | Definition                                                     | Mathematical Representation                             | Example from Patent/Investment Context                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 👁️ Belief/Observation | Raw information or data perceived from environment             | O = {o₁, o₂, ..., oₙ} where oᵢ are observable features  | From transcript: "Those who understand IT and how this works don't give much value to patents" - Raw observation of technical experts' view of patents                                                 |
| Understanding          | Interpretation layer that maps observations to internal states | U: O → S (mapping from observations to internal states) | From transcript: How investors make sense of patents varies based on their understanding of technology - some see it as valuable signal, others as mere formality                                      |
| 🧠 State               | Internal representation of knowledge/understanding             | S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₘ} where sᵢ are latent states        | From transcript: Jeff discusses how different investors have different mental models about patent value - some believe patents indicate technological capability, others see them as less meaningful   |
| Judging                | Decision function that converts states to actions              | J: S → A (mapping from states to actions)               | From transcript: Investors evaluate investment decisions differently based on their state of belief about patents' value - technical experts may discount patents while others may see them as crucial |
| 🤜 Action              | Observable behavior or choice                                  | A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} where aᵢ are possible actions     | From transcript: Investment decisions - whether to invest in companies based on their patent portfolio, with different actions emerging from different sense-making processes                          |
