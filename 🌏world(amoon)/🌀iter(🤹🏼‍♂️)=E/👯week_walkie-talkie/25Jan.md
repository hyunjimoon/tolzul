For "Decoding Venture Capital Decisions":

1. Data and Methods:
- Need to collect VC content from: Peter Thiel (Zero to One book), Bill Gurley (blog posts), Paul Graham, Mark Andreessen (P-Market blog archive)
- Already have experimental design grid with sectors, venture stage, team characteristics, traction indicators
- Using GPT for generating company descriptions and embedding analysis
- Plan to validate stimuli and run estimation routine

2. Key Research Direction:
- Hypothesis: The more VCs understand technology, the less value they assign to patents
- Framework maps observable startup characteristics ‚Üí perceptual dimensions ‚Üí investment decisions
- Need to explore relationship between patents and founding team characteristics

3. Implementation Next Steps:
- Collect and format VC content as text/PDF for LLM input
- Validate design grid including IP/patent features
- Run hierarchical multinomial logit model after data collection
- Use CDL (Creative Destruction Lab) data for validation

For "Venturing into Complexity":

1. Theoretical Framework:
- Focus on computational irreducibility vs "pockets of reducibility" 
- Individual startup trajectories are irreducible but patterns emerge across firms
- Connection to Bayesian calibration theory (Andrew's theorem 2)
- Hierarchical model allows partial exchangeability

2. Data Sources:
- TechStars accelerator data (tracking initial conditions and outcomes)
- CDL data showing granular mentor-startup interactions
- MIT delta V cohort data with Crunchbase/LinkedIn tracking

3. Research Direction:
- Study how startups sequence activities (analysis, experimentation, implementation)
- Identify systematic patterns while acknowledging individual unpredictability
- Use hierarchical models to find "pockets of reducibility" across ventures
