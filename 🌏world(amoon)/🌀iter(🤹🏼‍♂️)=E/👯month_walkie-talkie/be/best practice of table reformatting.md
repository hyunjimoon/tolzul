data from below is structured as three tables of each DATE. each table has four columns with the title:

column1: TIME
column2: TASKS
column3: PLACE
column4: Person in-Charge, which is NAME of the agent to whom TASK is assigned to


from the above, merge tables with different DATE. Then make a new table titled "[NAME]'s role" by selecting rows with column4 containing specific [NAME]. replace the string in TIME column with DATE+TIME. 

DATE are among 8 January, 9 January, 10 January
NAME are among Suting, Darshana, Dingyi, Kakali, Linda, Regina, Dulaj, Darshana, Ila, Angie

The result you'll show me are ten tables with each NAME as its title. Each table would have TIME, TASKS, PLACE, NAME column and the number of rows would be the number of TASKS each agent with NAME is assigned from the pdf.
