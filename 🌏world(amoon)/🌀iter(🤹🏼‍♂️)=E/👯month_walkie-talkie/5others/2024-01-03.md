1. fast clockspeed data: 1k sensor nodes, edges are mostly derived from node features but not necessarily
2. slow clockspeed data: chicago road segments 77k nodes, correlation between demographic and road segment data (angie thinks demographic and delta of road segment would have higher correlation e.g. gov. policy to construct more road for equity reasons based on low income area)
3. based on 1,2 what actions (in the name of policy) can improve the measure (economic growth, ?)

Q1. agent (:= body capable of affecting observation stronger than its measurement precision)level for 3? gov? institution? corporation (uber, lyft, grab)? startup? 
Q2. what other measures does 3 have?
