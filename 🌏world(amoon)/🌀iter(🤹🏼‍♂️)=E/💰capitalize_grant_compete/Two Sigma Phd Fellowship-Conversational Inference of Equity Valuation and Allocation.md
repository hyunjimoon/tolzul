In today's entrepreneurial landscape, there remains a critical gap in tools that democratize access to sophisticated financial decision-making. This research proposes a novel probabilistic programming framework for optimizing startup capitalization operations, focusing on early-stage startups' capitalization vehicle like Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs) for higher resolution financing. Our goal is to create more equitable and interpretable systems for financial decision-making in entrepreneurship, empowering founders with probabilistic program-based tools that enable them to effectively communicate their value and potential to investors. This approach aims to level the playing field, particularly for underrepresented founders, by facilitating more informed and balanced negotiations that encourage investors to join in taking intelligent risks together. 

Aligned with [MIT Quest for Intelligence's vision](https://quest.mit.edu/about/vision-statement), I diverge from large-scale end-to-end neural modeling. I interpret intelligence as decision-making through world models that combine symbolic, probabilistic, and differentiable computation. This approach enables systematic modeling of startup financing scenarios - from representing future valuations as probability distributions to sequentially updating term sheet proposals based on investor feedback - allowing founders to rigorously evaluate investment terms and negotiate valuation while accounting for uncertainties on one's chosen market, idea, and execution capability. Assembling probabilistic program building blocks like [MIT inference stack](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/software/open-probabilistic-programming-stack/),  [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and  [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/), I aim to develop Conversational inference of equity valuation and allocation (CIVA). CIVA enable users to flexibly balance between robust, interpretable results via symbolic inference and more general approximations, preserving essential human expertise while gaining computational support for navigating complex financing decisions. While we focus on the early stage, this research lays the groundwork for extending probabilistic programming approaches to capitalize scaling and mature stages of startup.

CIVA implements my vision for democratizing startup financing through a strategic combination of probabilistic programming and entrepreneurial operations theory, enabling founder and investor to recognize potential gaps between their beliefs on market opportunity, quality of idea, and company's executions capability. I execute this idea via concrete operational phases in partnership with innovation ecosystems in Boston and Singapore.

**Vision**: My goal is to build a probabilistic term sheet advisor that facilitates mutual understanding between founders and investors through transparent modeling of their beliefs. By processing comprehensive inputs including term sheets, expert's financial decision-making intuition, market dynamics, and stakeholder belief patterns, we generate interpretable valuations and shared understanding frameworks. This system bridges gaps in perspectives on market opportunity, idea quality, and execution capability through clear computational goals and logic. Our approach extends beyond traditional financial calculations to create balanced and informed financing decisions through systematic processing of both quantitative and qualitative inputs.

**Strategy**: I aim to implement this vision through two key levels of design. At the representation level, we develop probabilistic models of SAFE terms, valuation dynamics models, and natural language interfaces, supported by domain-specific languages for financial calculations. At the processing level, we combine formal probabilistic programming with language models to enable cognitive modeling of stakeholder belief dynamics, formal reasoning about complex terms, and dynamic updates as new information becomes available. This dual-level approach is supported by MIT's interdisciplinary expertise from Professor Charlie Fine (startup operations) and Professor Vikash Mansinghka (probabilistic programming) who are my references, while Two Sigma's human-AI complementarity research (e.g. [why human intuition is essential in machine learning](https://www.twosigma.com/articles/why-human-intuition-is-essential-in-machine-learning/)) provides industry mentorship. Unlike existing tools that focus purely on calculation or rely solely on statistical models, our representation and processing architecture uniquely combines formal probabilistic programming with language models to capture the cognitive aspects of capitalization, ensuring consistent handling of complex terms through formal modeling rather than ad-hoc approaches.

**Operations**: Implementation proceeds in three phases: First, developing probabilistic models with feedback from MIT's entrepreneurship network (including instructors from courses like Money for Startups (2.916) and Entrepreneurial Finance (15.431)), Boston's legal community (Latham & Watkins, Goodwin, Gunderson, WilmerHale), and Singapore's startup ecosystem (500.co, Temasek, Softbank, Action Community for Entrepreneurship). Second, validating our query engine against 20+ historical cases involving complex terms like participating preferred shares. Finally, testing through MIT accelerator programs (designX, delta-v, I-Corps, SMART Innovation Center) to measure improvements over traditional approach like cap table calculators.
