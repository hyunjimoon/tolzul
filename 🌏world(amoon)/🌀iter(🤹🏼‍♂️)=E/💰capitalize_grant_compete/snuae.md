The warehouse shelves were nearly empty, and my client's voice trembled over the phone. As the founder of NextOpt, an analytics startup dedicated to making predictive analytics affordable for small businesses, I knew our mission was at stake. Our clients depended on our highly accurate forecasting models and optimization software to manage their inventories effectively, but in that critical moment, the usual solutions fell short. I realized that addressing the inventory crisis required more than our sophisticated algorithms—it demanded humility, continuous learning, and the courage to seek collaborative solutions beyond technology. Recognizing that smaller enterprises often lacked infrastructure and confidence to adopt advanced analytics, I committed myself to becoming a leader who not only navigates uncertainty with creativity and rigor but also builds bridges between small businesses, technological innovation, and supportive policies

To tackle the crisis at hand, I reached beyond my own expertise. I consulted a former professor and connected with fellow entrepreneurs at a local tech meet-up—my first steps in building a network of mentors and peers. Together we brainstormed new inventory forecasting methods. The experience taught me the power of mentorship and collaboration. It wasn’t just my problem anymore; it became a shared mission. With their guidance, I resolved the immediate crisis and discovered a passion for systematic problem-solving. This victory reinforced my belief that complex problems are best solved by learning from others and growing together.

Encouraged by this experience, I looked inward at my academic journey and leadership. As an undergraduate at Seoul National University, I earned a 4.18/4.3 GPA and graduated top of my class—but applying that knowledge in the real world was a new test. Founding my startup “NextOpt” while still a student was an exercise in resilience. I secured an $85,000 government grant to grow NextOpt’s services, but more importantly, I learned how to inspire a team around a common vision. Leading by example—whether working through the night on a model or owning up to a strategy mistake—I aimed to be the kind of leader I admired. My team later told me that my determination pushed them to excel. Knowing I had become a role model for my team was humbling and affirming—proof that academic excellence and leadership can go hand in hand.

Throughout this journey, my Korean heritage has been a source of strength and inspiration. I grew up with the Korean ethos of “공동체” (community) and “배움에는 끝이 없다” (no end to learning). These values fueled my work when I co-founded StanKorea, a community to share knowledge in Bayesian statistics. I helped translate a seminal Bayesian textbook into Korean so that students and professionals at home could learn in our native language. This project was a tribute to the mentors who guided me and a way to give back to the Korean community that raised me. Organizing workshops through StanKorea—both online and in person—I watched young Korean statisticians connect with international experts. In those moments, I truly embodied my heritage, bridging cultures while uplifting others.

My desire to turn each challenge into growth eventually led me abroad for graduate studies. At Columbia and now at MIT, I’ve sought out renowned professors in statistics, engineering, and business, eager for their mentorship. Under the guidance of these mentors, I designed a decision-making framework called STRAP (Strategic Threshold Resolution for Actionable Priorities). In simple terms, STRAP is like a roadmap for entrepreneurs, helping them decide what to do next by pinpointing which uncertainty—whether a skeptical investor or an unproven technology—is holding them back. By tackling the biggest obstacle first, an entrepreneur can use limited resources wisely and dramatically increase the venture’s chance of success. I even visualized this process as a map in my thesis, showing how each decision moves a startup closer to winning over all its key stakeholders. Seeing this framework succeed in a real case—guiding a clean-energy startup to reduce its risks and satisfy both investors and regulators—was exhilarating. It confirmed that with the right blend of theory and practice, I can contribute original solutions to my field.

Now, as I stand on the cusp of the next chapter of my career, I am committed to carrying this momentum forward. If awarded this scholarship, I will channel the support into an initiative that unites my past and future. I plan to organize an entrepreneurship workshop series connecting MIT with universities in Korea, where I’ll teach aspiring founders the fundamentals of data-driven decision-making (inspired by STRAP) in an accessible way. I will invite mentors from my network—professors, startup CEOs, and community leaders—to guide participants, sparking new mentor-mentee relationships across borders. I also plan to develop open-source educational materials in both English and Korean so that insights from my research and experience can benefit entrepreneurs everywhere, not just those in the workshop. This scholarship would not just fund my education; it would be an investment in a vision: a future where knowledge flows freely across cultures, and where a young woman from Korea can grow into a leader who helps others rise as well.

In summary, I have learned to turn challenges into growth, build supportive networks, and lead with both excellence and empathy—all while honoring my Korean heritage. My journey is far from over. Armed with experience, mentorship, and an insatiable desire to learn, I am poised to become a pioneer in my field. This scholarship will be the catalyst that allows me to realize that ambition and, in turn, empower others on their own journeys of continuous growth and leadership.
