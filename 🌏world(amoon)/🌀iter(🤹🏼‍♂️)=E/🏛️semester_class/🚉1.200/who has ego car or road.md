tl;dr: I think ego-road is what we want, not ego-vehicle and wish to ask for some feedback. Any comments/questions/thoughts can save me from being trapped in "ego" rabbit hole.

Tangential to damping concept from CP1.3, I was wondering whether ego-vehicle is a precise concept. The damping in braking modeling term  $\text{damping in braking} = \min\left(1, \frac{s_{follow}^*}{s_{follow}}\right)$ reflects both _following driver's braking behavior_ or _lead driver's tendency_ to move away. However, for inferential purpose, having one modeling component represent two physical components can cause inferential degeneracy and not recommended. Partial improvement may be "ego-road (interval between two vehicles)" rather than "ego-vehicle". This decreases one degree of freedom (from N cars to N-1 intervals) which is a better model that prevents degeneracy problem. 

After all, wasn't road's summary statistics (e.g. relations between flow, density, speed) been our main interest, not nitty gritty details of "sense of self-esteem or self-importance (definition of ego)" of vehicle's driver?
