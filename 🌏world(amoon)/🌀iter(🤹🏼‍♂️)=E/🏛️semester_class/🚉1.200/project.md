Theory               |                                             | The theory focuses on using hierarchical Bayesian models as a temporary solution to decompose the effects of latent layers (delay types) on the observed data (delay time) until the more effective solution of collecting data at the fineness of intervention becomes available. This approach addresses the issue of aggregated delay time not being a Poisson process and improves the understanding of specific delay types for targeted interventions. Mixed Poisson becomes homogeneous Poisson using hierarchical Bayesian theory. We can use hierarchical Bayesian theory to explain the effect of separating sources as decomposing observations whose rate lambda is first sampled from a Gamma distribution (three types: signal delay, dwell delay, overflow delay). Then, the delay rate of each type (lambda1, lambda2, lambda3) is used to generate a Poisson process.<br>    1. Observational model for the data:  $(Y_i \mid \lambda_i) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i), \quad i=1, \ldots, k$   where $Y_i$ represents the observed delay for the $i$-th type (signal delay, dwell delay, or overflow delay), and $\lambda_i$ is the corresponding rate parameter. 2Structural model for the parameters of the likelihood $(\lambda_i \mid \alpha, \beta) \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta), \quad i=1, \ldots, k$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the shape and rate parameters of the Gamma distribution, respectively. 3. Hyperparameter model for the parameters of the structural model: $\alpha \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 0.5)$ $\beta \sim \text{Gamma}(0.1, 1)$ By separating the sources of delay into signal delay, dwell delay, and overflow delay, we are essentially decomposing the inhomogeneous Poisson process into multiple homogeneous Poisson processes, each with its own rate parameter $\lambda_i$. The hierarchical Bayesian model allows us to account for the uncertainty in the rate parameters by assigning them a Gamma prior distribution, which is a conjugate prior for the Poisson likelihood. The hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are given their own prior distributions to complete the hierarchical structure. This hierarchical Bayesian approach helps to explain how separating the sources of delay can lead to a more homogeneous Poisson process for each source, as the rate parameters are modeled as being drawn from a common Gamma distribution. The posterior distribution of the rate parameters can be inferred using Bayesian inference techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. |
