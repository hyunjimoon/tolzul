This study examines the tradeoffs in sourcing and sales strategies (i.e., upstream and downstream supply chain strategies) by considering them as components of an integral end-to-end supply chain strategy. We evaluate four end-to-end supply chain strategies under various scenarios using a newsvendor model, and compare the model’s predictions against the prescriptions in Fisher’s (1997) framework, which recommends “cost-efﬁcient” supply chains for “functional” products and “responsive” supply chains for “innovative” products. We considered combinations of offshore vs. nearshore sourcing, and online vs. brick-and-mortar retailing. This study’s key ﬁnding is that sourcing and sales strategies are not completely modular: an integral end-to-end strategy may not decompose into an optimal sourcing strategy and a separately computed optimal sales strategy. Our analyses sharpen strategic supply chain thinking by identifying realistic conditions in which an end-to-end strategy with cost-efﬁcient components could outperform one with responsive components for innovative products, or when one with responsive components could be more proﬁtable than one with cost-efﬁcient components for functional products.

💠: 🚢 Offshore vs 🏭 Nearshore sourcing, 🌐 Online vs 🧱 B&M sales

Key Concepts:
- 🚢 Offshore: Lower cost but longer lead times
- 🏭 Nearshore: Higher cost but more responsive  
- 🌐 Online: Centralized inventory, higher returns
- 🧱 B&M: Distributed inventory, lower returns

Key Takeaways:
1. Conventional wisdom often wrong
2. 🌐+🚢 can beat 🧱+🏭 for innovative products (surprise!)
3. High returns → favor 🧱 regardless of product type
4. Demand uncertainty → favor 🌐 regardless of source
5. Low margins + innovative products → go 🌐
6. Shows that sourcing (🚢/🏭) and sales (🌐/🧱) strategies must be evaluated together  - sometimes leading to counterintuitive optimal combinations that wouldn't be discovered by analyzing each decision separately.
