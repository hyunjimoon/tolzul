1. The Goodman et al. paper on "Learning Grounded Causal Models" is relevant because it shows how systems can learn multiple layers simultaneously:
- Observable variables (perceptual grounding)
- Causal structure between variables
- The relationship between perception and causation

world is causal, but our observation2theory2hypotheis is complex?

Specific Examples for Each Condition:

1. **Tesla Condition**
- Testing basic cell gives 70% performance
- Adding thermal gets 90%
- Manufacturing optimization reveals hidden 100%

2. **BYD Condition**
- Safety testing shows 80% cost
- Structural tests reveal 90% manufacturing
- Combined approach enables 100% optimization

3. **Porsche Condition**
- Premium segment accepts 70% traditional metrics
- Performance redefinition gets 90% acceptance
- Brand heritage integration achieves 100%

Experiment Setting:
"Students interact with a virtual product development simulator where they can 'test' different market-feature combinations by clicking cells in a grid, receiving feedback on each test's success while operating under time and budget constraints."

Mathematical Measure:
The key ratio being measured is:

$\text{Strategy Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Value Discovered}}{\text{(Test Cost)} \times \text{(Time Between Tests)}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i}{C \times \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (t_{i+1} - t_i)}$

Where:
- $V_i$ = value discovered in test i (0-100%)
- $C$ = cost per test ($100K)
- $t_i$ = timestamp of test i
- $n$ = total number of tests conducted

This measures how effectively students balance exploration (finding new value) against exploitation (using known information) under resource constraints.

Ah yes! Let me redesign the experiment following Goodman's "alien panel" paradigm but applied to automotive innovation:

| Testing Dimension | Grid Design | Mathematical Measure |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Criticality** (Is this the right hypothesis to test?) | ‚Ä¢ 6x6 grid with hidden "innovation regions"<br>‚Ä¢ Tesla Case: Two adjacent regions might be one large market (like Goodman's button experiment)<br>‚Ä¢ Each click reveals if region is "active" with dot appearance | $\text{ValidApproxBiasCost}(\phi) = \frac{\text{Size of Active Region}}{\text{Total Grid Size}}$ |
| **Fidelity** (Is this test giving accurate signals?) | ‚Ä¢ BYD Case: Safety region activates manufacturing benefits<br>‚Ä¢ Dots appear in specific patterns indicating causal relationships<br>‚Ä¢ Hidden relationships between regions (like Goodman's causal structure) | $\text{VerifApproxBiasCost}(\theta\|\phi) = \frac{\text{Correct Causal Links Found}}{\text{Total Possible Links}}$ |
| **Opportunity Cost** (What resources are spent?) | ‚Ä¢ Each click costs virtual budget<br>‚Ä¢ 5-minute time limit per condition<br>‚Ä¢ Porsche Case: Premium vs Mass market regions with brand value transfer | $\text{OpportunityCost}(\theta,\phi,N,M) = \text{Clicks} \times \text{Time Between Clicks}$ |

Concrete Experiment Structure:
1. **Condition A (Tesla)**: 
   - Two adjacent regions that might be one market
   - Must discover if separate or unified market
   - Similar to Goodman's "are these separate buttons?"

2. **Condition B (BYD)**:
   - Safety testing reveals manufacturing benefits
   - Must discover causal relationships
   - Like Goodman's hidden causal structure

3. **Condition C (Porsche)**:
   - Brand value transfers across regions
   - Must map value flow patterns
   - Similar to Goodman's effect propagation

Success Metric:
$\text{Learning Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Correct Structure Identified}}{\text{Total Resources Used}} = \frac{\text{Causal Links Found}}{(\text{Clicks}) \times (\text{Time})}$

This design more closely follows Goodman's experimental paradigm while maintaining the automotive industry context. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific condition?
