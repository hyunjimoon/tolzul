coordination issues of not touching the bird more than twice - 
move in (agency: goal and efficient ways to achieve the goal) 

cognitive capacity, behavioral of adults, qualitative for young, quantative for older

how do we get so much from so little (cognition: going beyound data given) - problem of induction

how does abstract knowledge guide learning and inference from sparse data, different domains and tasks, 
innvate specification experience

learning of evolutionary time (intelligence of emergence - evolutionary time)

cannot empirical study evolution (learning mechanism; intelligence comes from brain and cultural evolution, (data and social environment we grow up)  - different from gd, prob.prog; brain is amazing as itt build and repair itself)

what general principles might apply to all?

how much 

computational tools for framing the answer; priors are only there for evolution (designing the flexible priors) in ML prior is usually used for hardwired architecture, but actually not (entrenched are quite flexible - strong but felxible)

gravities are very strong prior but is very flexible (mental model - violating intuitve interpretation of physics of the world)

imagine data that can convince me. 

i guess that's the world we're living in
