this class project for Josh Tenenbaum's [[966 Computational Cognitive Science]] 
can co-evolve with
- [[üìùParallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] with JB (Q. resource allocation vector's speed and direction with co-adaptation lens?)
- [framing EV manufacturer's three prediction questions by when](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/256#discussioncomment-10738781) with Bob (Q. how to better compare across different environments?)

### AGENDA
1. can we interpret environment's selection pressure as two uncertainties on idea's value and how well one is executing it
2. is modeling three parameters (low üí∏testing / pivoting cost, high üé≤uncertainty, low üß©correlation between operations and marketing process) beneficial for parallel search representable in product1's model? - JB
3. How should entrepreneurs dynamically adjust their pc/pr ratio when transitioning from digital to physical products (or vice versa)? For example, if our AdTech company starts offering physical marketing materials, or if our EV company launches a digital vehicle management platform?

## PRODUCT1
**Research Question:**  **Research Question:** How do entrepreneurs allocate limited cognitive resources between cost-reduction and revenue-growth activities during venture scaling? Like organisms under evolutionary pressure, entrepreneurs face dual uncertainties about their core idea's value and their strategy's effectiveness. What appears as "biased" resource allocation may actually represent rational adaptations to different industry environments i.e. "explaining away" irrationality with environments.

**Methodology:** Drawing on computational rationality and resource-rational decision making theories, we conceptualize entrepreneurial resource allocation as a vector with magnitude (processing speed) and direction (operational cost-reducing vs. market revenue growth). Our computational model captures entrepreneurial decision-making through three core mechanisms:

1. **Belief Updates:** $\color{Green}{p_c} \sim Beta(\alpha_c, \beta_c), \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r} \sim Beta(\alpha_r, \beta_r)$  Entrepreneurs maintain and update beliefs about cost-reduction ($\color{Green}{p_c}$) and revenue-growth ($\color{#C0A0C0}{p_r}$) probabilities through environmental signals.

2. **Processing Speed:** $\color{Green}{pred_c} = exp(N(\color{Green}{p_c}, \sigma)), \color{#C0A0C0}{pred_r} = exp(N(\color{#C0A0C0}{p_r}, \sigma))$ Parameter œÉ controls the speed-accuracy tradeoff in decision-making, transforming beliefs through log-normal noise.

3. **Action Selection:**   $\color{Red}{a^*} = \underset{\color{Red}{a \in \{a_c, a_r\}}}{\arg\max} \: \Delta\color{Red}{U}(\color{Green}{pred_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{pred_r}, \color{Red}{a})$ where $\color{Red}{\Delta U} = \color{Green}{pred_c} \cdot \color{Red}{a_c} + \color{#C0A0C0}{pred_r} \cdot \color{Red}{a_r}$ subject to $\color{Red}{a_c} + \color{Red}{a_r} = 1$ Entrepreneurs choose between operational ($\color{Red}{a_c}$) and market ($\color{Red}{a_r}$) focus based on expected change in utility, which is the sum of predicted returns weighted by action allocation.

**Contributions**: This research will advance theory by providing a unified framework for understanding rational adaptation in entrepreneurial decision-making, while offering practical guidelines for context-specific resource allocation optimization. Table of contents:
