Experimental Choice and Disruptive Technologies

Abstract. This paper examines how a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs choice of the type of experiment impacts on its potential exploitation of new technological opportunities. It does so in the context of the failure of successful Ô¨Årms (or disruption) where the literature has informally suggested that Ô¨Årms undertake errors in experimental choice. It is shown that Ô¨Årms will generically choose experiments that minimize false positives (a high-bar) or minimize false negatives (a lowbar) rather than strike a balance between the two. This is done to better inform decisions regarding the exploitation of technological opportunities. It is shown that these choices can differ between incumbents and entrants based on their fundamentals and because of the anticipation of competition between them.
