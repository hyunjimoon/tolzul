Throughout its history, the industrial engineering/operations management (IE/OM) field has relied heavily on axiomatic models and empirical studies of individual systems. But, unlike other engineering and management disciplines, it lacks a clear foundation in a descriptive science. Exceptional results like the famous “bullwhip effect” paper by Lee et al. (1997) hint at the powerful potential for a descriptive science of operations. But the very fact that such works are exceptional suggests that they are held to a high bar in the publishing process. This may be symptomatic of the cultural norms that have prevented our field from producing a rigorous scientific foundation. In this study, we make a case for why developing a unified science of operations is essential for IE/OM education, practice and research. We provide examples and a tentative framework to illustrate what such a science might look like and use this framework to generate a testable hypothesis about a powerful relationship between variability buffers in and operations system. We conclude with suggestions of measures we can take collectively to promote development of the science of operations.
