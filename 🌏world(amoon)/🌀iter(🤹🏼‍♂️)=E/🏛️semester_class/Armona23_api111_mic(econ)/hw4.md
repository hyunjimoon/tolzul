#### 2. takeaway: feasible set contains a ray meaning we can always produce more. Profits are 0 or infinite.

PMP $=\max _{q, z} p \cdot q-\vec{z} \cdot p_z$, s.t. $\left(p_1 \hat{z}\right) \in Y$ and $q, z \geq 0$
solution to PMP is where
$$
\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_i^*}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_j^*}}=\frac{p_i}{p_j}, \forall_{i j}
$$

If the constraint binds such that $z_1=0$, the because of the no free lunch assimpinon $f(\vec{z})=0$. So $T(\vec{p})=0$. Nothing can be produced if no inputs are purchased and profits $=0$ or negative if firm incurs fixed costs.

By dentition of increasing returns to scale, if $\left(q, z\right) \in Y$, then $(aq, az) \in Y \quad \forall a>0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi^*\left(a q^*, a z^*\right) & =p q \cdot a q^*-p_z \cdot a \overrightarrow{z^*} \\
& =a\left(p q \cdot q^*-p_z \cdot \vec{z}^*\right) \\
& =a \pi^*\left(q^*, z^*\right)>\pi\left(q^*, z^*\right), \text { base } a>1
\end{aligned}
$$
this implies profit is infinity (prove by contradiction: if not, assume A s.t. profit is smaller than A then we can find a s.t. profit becomes larger than A)
#### 3. takeaway: 
- people are less sensitive to learning than price which is shown as lower absolute value for graph1 learning curve (mc(q) vs q: c-mq) than graph2 inverse demand curve (a-bq)
- learning leads more production in first period, and without third period, second is competitive equilibrium

##### (a) Monopolists output in each period
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \pi_1=q_1\left(p\left(q_1\right) \cdot c_1\right)=a q_1-b q_1^2 \cdot q_1 c_1 \\
& \pi_2=q_2\left(p\left(q_2\right) \cdot\left(c_1-m q_1\right)\right)=a q_2-b_1 q_2{ }^2-c_1 q_2+m {q_1} q_2
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max \pi_1+\pi_2=\max a q_1-b q_1^2-c_1 q_1+a_{q_2}-b q_2^2-c_1 q_2+m q_1 q_2 \\
& q_1, q_2 \text { s.t. } q_1, q_2=0 \\

& \text { FOC} \\
& \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_1} = a-2 b q_1-c_1-q_2+m q_2=0 \\
& \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_2}=a-2 b q_2-c_1+m q_1=0 \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$

Assume constraint doesn't bind $\Rightarrow \lambda_1=\lambda_2=0$
$q_1 = \frac{a-c_1+m q_2}{2 b}$
$a-2 b q_2-c_1+m\left[\frac{a-c_1+m q_2}{2 b}\right]=0$, Assume $b>0$ which we are told
$$
\begin{aligned}
q_2^*=\frac{\left(c_1-a\right)(m+2 b)}{(m+2 b)(m-2 b)}=\frac{c_1-a}{m-2 b}=\frac{a-c}{20-m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $b>m \Rightarrow 2 b>m$, and $a>c$, this is positive so no corner care
$$
q_1^*=\frac{a-c_1+m\left(\frac{a-c}{2 b \cdot m}\right)}{2 b}: \frac{a-c_1}{2 b}+\frac{m}{2 b}\left[\frac{a-c}{2 b-m}\right]=\frac{a-c}{2 b-m}
$$
##### (b) derive q in each period for social planner

Social planner max. total welfare in each pernod, so they max the sum across:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& w_1=\int_0^{q_1} p(x)-c^{\prime}(x) d x=\int_0^{q_1} a-b x-c_1 d x \\
& w_2=\int_0^{q_2} p(x)-c^{\prime}(x) d x=\int_0^{q_1} a-b x-c_1+m q_1 d x \\
& w_1=a_{q_1}-\frac{b q_1^2}{2}-c_1 q_1 \\
& w_2=a q_2-\frac{b q_2^2}{2}-c_1 q_2+m q_1 q_2
\end{aligned}
$$
me then max $w_1+w_2=max_{q_1, q_2} a q_1-\frac{b_{q_1}^2}{2}-c_1 q_1+a q_2-\frac{b q_2^2}{2}-c_1 q_2+m q_1 q_2$
using FOC,
$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{b-m} \quad q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{b-m}$

##### (c) p=mc for social planner?
$\begin{aligned} & \text { In period 1, } p: a-b\left[\frac{a-c_1}{b \cdot m}\right] \\ & =\frac{a^2-a b-c a+c b}{b-m} \\ & =\frac{a b-a m-a b+b c}{b-m} \\ & =\frac{b c_1-a m}{b \cdot m} \text {, which is greater than } M C \text { when } \frac{b c_1-a m}{b-m}>c_1 \\ & \rightarrow b c_1-a_m>c_1 b-m c \text {. } \\ & m c_1>a m \\ & c_1>a\end{aligned}$
In period 2, price is also $\frac{b c_1-a m}{b \cdot m}$.
Marginal cost is: $c_1=ma_1$
$$
c_1-m\left[\frac{a-c}{b-m}\right]=\frac{c_1 b-c_1 m-m a+m c_1}{b-m}=\frac{b c-a m}{b-m}
$$

In period 2, the social planner sets $p=M C$

#### 4. takeway: should we account for dropout (p.7 lec15)..? 

To derive the demand functions for each product, we need to understand how consumers choose between the two courses based on their utility from each course and the prices set by Armona LLC (A) and Benevolent LLC (B). 

Given the utility function $u_{i,j} = \bar{u}_j - \theta_i M_j - p_j$, where $\theta_i$ is uniformly distributed over $[0, \alpha]$, we can determine the demand for each course by considering the point at which a consumer is indifferent between the two courses. At this point, the utility from both courses is equal.

Indifference Condition
For a consumer to be indifferent between the two courses, the utility from each must be equal:

 $\bar{u}_A - \theta_i M_A - p_A = \bar{u}_B - \theta_i M_B - p_B$

Since $M_A = 1$ for Armona and $M_B = 0$ for Benevolent, the equation simplifies to:

$\bar{u}_A - \theta_i - p_A = \bar{u}_B - p_B$

Solving for $\theta_i$, we get the indifference point $\theta^*$:

$\theta^* = \bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B$

Demand for Benevolent LLC (B)
Consumers will choose Benevolent if $\theta_i$ is greater than $\theta^*$, as they would prefer less math-intensive content. The proportion of consumers with $\theta_i > \theta^*$ is given by:

$1 - \frac{\theta^*}{\alpha} = 1 - \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

So, the demand for Benevolent LLC (B) is:

$q_B(p_A, p_B) = 1 - \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

Demand for Armona LLC (A)
Conversely, consumers will choose Armona if $\theta_i$ is less than $\theta^*$. The proportion of consumers with $\theta_i < \theta^*$ is:

$\frac{\theta^*}{\alpha} = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

So, the demand for Armona LLC (A) is:

$q_A(p_A, p_B) = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

Note that these demand functions are valid under the assumption that the market shares are positive for both firms. This implies that $0 < q_A(p_A, p_B) < 1$ and $0 < q_B(p_A, p_B) < 1$, which imposes certain constraints on the prices $p_A$ and $p_B$.

These demand functions reflect how the market share of each course depends on its own price, the price of the competitor, and the difference in perceived value between the two courses, adjusted for the population's heterogeneity in their dislike for math.

To derive the optimal price choices for each company, we need to consider the profit maximization problem for both Armona LLC (A) and Benevolent LLC (B). Since we are dealing with Bertrand competition, each firm sets its price to maximize its profit, given the price set by the other firm. The profit for each firm is the product of its price and the quantity sold, and since the marginal cost is zero, the profit is simply the revenue.

##### (b)
Profit Functions
The profit functions for A and B are:

1. **Profit for Armona LLC (A):**$\Pi_A = p_A \cdot q_A(p_A, p_B)$
2. **Profit for Benevolent LLC (B):**$\Pi_B = p_B \cdot q_B(p_A, p_B)$

Using the demand functions derived earlier:

1.$q_A(p_A, p_B) = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$
2.$q_B(p_A, p_B) = 1 - \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

Maximizing Profit
Each firm chooses its price to maximize its profit, taking into account the price set by the other firm. The first-order conditions for profit maximization are obtained by differentiating the profit functions with respect to the firm's own price and setting the derivative equal to zero.

For Armona LLC (A):

$\frac{d\Pi_A}{dp_A} = q_A + p_A \cdot \frac{dq_A}{dp_A} = 0$

Substituting for$q_A$ and simplifying, we get:

$\frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha} + p_A \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\alpha} \right) = 0$

Solving for$p_A$:

$p_A = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B + p_B}{2}$

For Benevolent LLC (B):

$\frac{d\Pi_B}{dp_B} = q_B + p_B \cdot \frac{dq_B}{dp_B} = 0$

Substituting for$q_B$ and simplifying, we get:

$1 - \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha} + p_B \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\alpha} \right) = 0$

Solving for$p_B$:

$p_B = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B + p_A}{2}$

$p_A = p_B = \bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B$

Equilibrium Prices

The equilibrium prices $p_A$ and $p_B$ are determined when both firms are simultaneously maximizing their profits. This typically requires solving the two equations together. However, due to the symmetry in the form of the equations, it's clear that the equilibrium prices will depend on the relative values of$\bar{u}_A$ and $\bar{u}_B$.

When Does A Charge a Higher Price?
Armona LLC (A) will charge a higher price when$\bar{u}_A > \bar{u}_B$, as indicated in the problem statement. This is because the value of the course offered by A is higher, and consumers are willing to pay more for it, even if they have a dislike for math. The degree to which A can charge a higher price also depends on the distribution of$\theta_i$ in the population, which reflects the consumers' aversion to math.

In this scenario, the pricing strategy of each firm is influenced by the perceived value of their product and the price set by the competitor. Armona, offering a more math-intensive course, can charge more if its course is perceived to be of higher value ($\bar{u}_A > \bar{u}_B$). 
The equilibrium reflects a balance where each firm takes into account not only the consumer preferences but also the pricing strategy of its competitor. The higher price charged by A in the case of$\bar{u}_A > \bar{u}_B$ is a reflection of its higher perceived value despite the potential aversion to math among some consumers.

##### (c)
To derive the diversion ratio matrix for this problem, we need to calculate the price elasticities of demand for each product with respect to the price of each product. The diversion ratio, as defined, is the ratio of the cross-price elasticity to the own-price elasticity.

Given the demand functions:

1. $q_A(p_A, p_B) = \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$
2. $q_B(p_A, p_B) = 1 - \frac{\bar{u}_A - \bar{u}_B - p_A + p_B}{\alpha}$

Price Elasticities and diversion ratio
1. Own-price elasticity of A
$\varepsilon_{A,A} = \frac{\partial q_A}{\partial p_A} \cdot \frac{p_A}{q_A} = \left( -\frac{1}{\alpha} \right) \cdot \frac{p_A}{q_A}$
2. **Cross-price elasticity of A with respect to B, $\varepsilon_{A,B}$:**
$\varepsilon_{A,B} = \frac{\partial q_A}{\partial p_B} \cdot \frac{p_B}{q_A} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{p_B}{q_A}$
$D_{A B}=\frac{\frac{d \varepsilon_B}{d \varepsilon_A}}{\frac{d \varepsilon_B}{d p_B}}=-\frac{-1}{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}=-a$

3. **Own-price elasticity of B, $\varepsilon_{B,B}$:**
$\varepsilon_{B,B} = \frac{\partial q_B}{\partial p_B} \cdot \frac{p_B}{q_B} = \left( -\frac{1}{\alpha} \right) \cdot \frac{p_B}{q_B}$

4. **Cross-price elasticity of B with respect to A, $\varepsilon_{B,A}$:**
$\varepsilon_{B,A} = \frac{\partial q_B}{\partial p_A} \cdot \frac{p_A}{q_B} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{p_A}{q_B}$, 
$D_{B,A} = \frac{\varepsilon_{B,A}}{\varepsilon_{B,B}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{p_A}{q_B}}{-\frac{1}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{p_B}{q_B}} = -\frac{p_A}{p_B}$


1. **Dependence on $\alpha$:** The fraction of consumers switching from A to B (and vice versa) does not directly depend on $\alpha$. Instead, it depends on the ratio of the prices of the two products. This indicates that the switching behavior is more sensitive to relative pricing than to the heterogeneity in consumer preferences for math (as captured by $\alpha$).

2. **Price Sensitivity:** The diversion ratios suggest that if one product increases its price, consumers are likely to switch to the other product. The extent of this switching is directly proportional to the price ratio. If A becomes significantly more expensive than B, a larger fraction of A's customers will switch to B, and vice versa.

3. **Market Dynamics:** In a Bertrand competition framework, such diversion ratios are crucial for understanding competitive dynamics. If one firm raises its price, it risks losing a significant portion of its customer base to its competitor, especially if the competitor's price remains constant or decreases.

4. **Strategic Pricing:** Understanding these diversion ratios can help each firm in strategically setting its prices. If a firm knows that a small increase in its price will lead to a significant loss of customers to its competitor, it might opt for more competitive pricing strategies.

In summary, the diversion ratios in this scenario highlight the importance of price competition between the two firms and indicate that consumer switching behavior is more influenced by relative prices than by the heterogeneity in their preferences for the type of course content.

##### (d)
When Armona and Benevolent merge into a single company (AB) and decide to sell the two products separately at separate prices, the market dynamics change significantly. Instead of competing against each other (as in Bertrand competition), the merged entity now faces an internal optimization problem where it must decide how to price each product to maximize overall profit.

Price Equilibrium in the Merged Company

1. **Monopoly Pricing:** The merged entity AB now acts as a monopolist for the two products. It will set prices for both courses to maximize total profits, taking into account the demand for each course and how changes in the price of one course affect the demand for the other.

2. **Internal Substitution:** AB will consider the internal substitution between the two courses. If the price of one course is raised too high, it might lead to an increase in demand for the other course. The company will aim to balance the prices in a way that maximizes total revenue.

3. **Price Discrimination:** The company might engage in a form of price discrimination, where it sets different prices for essentially similar products that are differentiated only by the mode of teaching (math-intensive vs. graphically intensive). This could potentially allow the company to capture a larger portion of consumer surplus.

Consumer Welfare

1. **Higher Prices:** It is likely that the merged entity will set higher prices for both products than in the competitive scenario, as the incentive to undercut the competitor's price is gone. This could lead to a decrease in consumer surplus, making consumers worse off.

2. **Less Choice:** Even though the products are still distinct, the lack of competition might reduce the incentive for the company to innovate or maintain high quality in both products. This could also negatively impact consumers.

3. **Dependence on α:** The impact on consumer welfare could be a function of α, which represents the heterogeneity in consumer preferences for math. If α is large (indicating a wide range of preferences), the company might be more inclined to differentiate the prices significantly to cater to different segments of the market. This could either benefit or harm consumers, depending on how sensitive they are to price changes and how much they value each specific course format.

In summary, the merger of Armona and Benevolent into a single entity and the decision to sell two differentiated products at separate prices would likely lead to higher prices and potentially reduced consumer welfare. The exact impact on price equilibrium and consumer welfare would depend on how the merged company decides to balance its pricing strategy to maximize profits while considering the internal substitution between its products and the heterogeneity in consumer preferences. The lack of competition could lead to less favorable outcomes for consumers, particularly in terms of price and product quality.
