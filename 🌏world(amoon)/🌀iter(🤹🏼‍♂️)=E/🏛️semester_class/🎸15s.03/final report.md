understand how a situation works (scientist) to imagine (artist) how it might be improved (judge). How we would like a situation to be (judge) is constrained by how it can actually work (scientist), but if we can create the right perspective (artist) we can align our desires with reality. Even when a new approach (artist) can be demonstrated to control a situation (scientist), if the approach is seen as inappropriate or even questionable (judge) people will not adopt it.


Innovation is often deÔ¨Åned as the production of knowledge through experimentation (Arrow 1969, Weitzman 1979)
### 1. literature review
## bayesian 

objective risk: slower state and faster choice
subjective belief in a small world is slower action and faster state

process: see signal, update belief, play lottery (experiment), get reward, consume utility

- higher the mu_pf, lower the `high bar`
