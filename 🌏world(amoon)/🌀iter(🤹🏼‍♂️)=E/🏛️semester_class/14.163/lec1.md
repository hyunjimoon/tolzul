- **phd classes should orient you to the near future**
- ml and behav.econ will not exist without the other
### why be can't live wo ml 
- role of algorithm (systematically produce variation); algorithm:= a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer
- in the next 10 yrs, much of hiring will be increasingly algorithmic 
- changing ppl is hard, but code is easy to rewrite (this is an opportunity)
- building algorithm to eliminate bias
- problem is human bias and solution is algorithm
- understanding of behavior **behind** race gap (need pre-work that points to the problem) - > insight behind right algorithm
- feasible and impactful paper is very scarce (a thinks tool-based paper can overcome this; JSS)
- decisions are being increasingly algorithim (playbook: find consequential distortion that's hard to fix, decisions are increasinlgy algorithmic - suggest algorithm to improve distortion)

### why ml can't live wo be
- set of automation tasks (images, label) dataset, predict label from image
- adoption by clinician 
- distribution shift issues (urban, country)
- doctor's label (labels are gold stnadard, but for human quality degrade over time)
- algorithm is being trained on cnosensus of the field (jury, biased to not see (enemy is coming in the dessert), where's waldo)
- need model of physician judgment
- noise iid = universal south of ignorance (1. ; 2.don't believe in prob.) 
- enormous psychology in judgement (error is not noise, but systematic object)
- must make assujmpion about meaning of that data, be models give structure to those assumptions
- disentangle expertise from bias and noise
- adjudicated vs clinical settings 
- automate as they are but "at their best"
- "breaktrhough on how to incorporate formal be model with supervised learning" is hard; adjudicated jus
- clinical decision making is a large field in psychology
- smell test is funny as when sendil did the resume, employers predicted the opposite (need to show they hire black)

### fundus and resume commons:
- outsized positivity: improve hiring and diagnostics 
- algorithm is qualitatively different but solves biggest problems in this space: scale
- train data include human's behavior fingerprint (learning from human to outperform them)
- resume example is for algorithm 

- nudges (default setting) is specific, algorithms is more on choice architecture
- decide where to turn the ray bug, how to build it in first place

so far was normative (establish hypotheses that can be empirically tested; understanding should be behind algorithm)

positive (based on opinion or subjective values)
- how can algorithms help us with understanding
