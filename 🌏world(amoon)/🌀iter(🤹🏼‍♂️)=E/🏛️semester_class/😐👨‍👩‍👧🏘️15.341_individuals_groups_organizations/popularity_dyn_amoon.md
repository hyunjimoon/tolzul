Simpson's paradox : inhomogenous conditional distribution of qoi where time and space frame. e.g. E[V|T,S] value of vaccine is higher in rich countries and during each initial period of covid virus variant
i.e. nonuniform disaggregated value distrubiton when conditioned on level of disaggregation e.g. 
- E[V|T=1] !=E[V|T=365] (yearly and daily effect and periodicity kicks in)
- E[V|S=DC] !=E[V|S=NY] (policy of each state)

## popularity dynamics
**popularity** is accorded state [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity#cite_note-1) of  how person (author, actor), idea (paper, movie), place (country, state), expressed by other people. It rests on four foundations: 
1.  **  
    Liking and attraction are not the same.** The interpersonal feeling of "liking" is not the same as "attraction" and that both are responsible for different human behaviours. The neurological evidence of this comes from the research of [Kent C. Berridge](x-dictionary:r:'Kent_C._Berridge?lang=en&signature=com.apple.DictionaryApp.Wikipedia' "Kent C. Berridge") and his [incentive salience](x-dictionary:r:'Incentive_salience?lang=en&signature=com.apple.DictionaryApp.Wikipedia' "Incentive salience") model. _Popularity Explained_ extrapolates the conclusions of this research and applies it to human-human interpersonal interactions.
2.  **A hierarchy of interpersonal attraction exists in all social groups.** _Popularity Explained_ develops a very broad definition of [interpersonal attraction](x-dictionary:r:'Interpersonal_attraction?lang=en&signature=com.apple.DictionaryApp.Wikipedia' "Interpersonal attraction") asserting that it is based on a multitude of different factors but primarily those of: socioeconomic status; interpersonal similarity; physical appearance; and efficacy. It proposes the concept of a "Hierarchy of Attraction" which, in simple terms, is just a stylized bell curve that illustrates how attractive people are relative to each other in terms of a percentile.
3.  **Interpersonal attraction (in the broadest sense) results in Input of Energy.** Input of Energy is the interpersonal actions that an individual takes, consciously and unconsciously, when they experience an interpersonal attraction. Examples of Input of Energy given in the book include: attempts at physical proximity; changes in verbal communications; changes to non-verbal communication; biased interpersonal judgments; cognitive intrusion; and helping behaviour.
4.  **Sociometric and perceived popularity are correlated but not equivalent.** By combining these two concepts, _Popularity Explained_ defines eight prototypical student types that can be plotted on the single graph.

Iterative update of its attractiveness by time and space and also with other topics.


My hobby is detecting typos and collecting ugly posterior geometries.
- Both imaginative and realistic, sympathetic data consideration and perceptive test qualities are required for this approach. 
- body and soul, innovative part and  regulation 
- innovation is measured by group's perception (시대를 앞서간 발자크) and understanding this dynamics help us to linger on the revolutionary boundary so that we become an accepted innovation 
- find disruptive sentence ("first"?)
- 
- so much as to become an accepted inn
consistent theme would be consistency

connect every topic with movie (preferably system)
man, machine, material, information, energy
actor, music, title, estimation, dominance, simulation, system, 
narrative dynamics, genre, icon,
