### Research Domain and Motivation
How does entrepreneurs allocate limited cognitive resources between cost-reduction and revenue-growth activities during venture scaling? This is interesting because while much research examines what decisions entrepreneurs make, less attention has been paid to how cognitive  constraints shape these decisions across different industry contexts.

How can seemingly "biased" patterns of entrepreneurial attention allocation between cost-saving and revenue gaining capability development be explained as rational adaptations to different industry environments? i.e. can environment explain away irrationality? Both “rational resource allocation” and “environment” causes “observed behavior of entrepreneurs” and by understanding “environment” better, information flows to “rational resource allocation” (mostly from irrational -> rational)?

### 1. Venture's Cognitive Resource Investment as Vector(🧍‍♀️'s 🧭)

Much as evolutionary pressure drives organisms to adapt or perish, entrepreneurs face dual uncertainties that shape their strategic evolution: whether their core idea holds inherent value, and whether their chosen strategy can effectively capture that value (Agrawal et al. 2021). These uncertainties serve as the selective mechanism through which entrepreneurs must optimize their cognitive resource allocation between operations and market development—a challenge we can formalize as a vector with both direction and magnitude. Gershman et al. (2015) provides a unified computational framework linking brains, minds and machines, demonstrating how processing speed affects decision quality under resource constraints, while Bhui et al. (2021) offers a mathematical framework for representing resource-rational decision making under constraints, showing how limited cognitive resources shape strategic choices. By applying these frameworks, we can represent entrepreneurial resource allocation as a vector where magnitude captures the depth and speed of information processing (sec.2) while direction indicates the ratio between operational and market focus (sec.3). This vector-based conceptualization sets up our next challenge: understanding what determines the optimal processing investment in different entrepreneurial contexts. 

Decision around cognitive resource investment happens in three steps: 1. Belief Update: $p(\color{Green}{p_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r} | \color{Green}{d_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{d_r}\color{White}{)} \propto p(\color{Green}{d_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{d_r} | \color{Green}{p_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r}) * p(\color{Green}{p_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r})$, 2. Uncertainty: $pred_{c,r} = exp(N(p_{c,r}, \sigma))$, 3. Action Selection: $\color{Red}{a^*} = \underset{a}{\text{argmax }} \color{Red}{\Delta u}(\color{Green}{p_c|d_c}, \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r|d_r}, \color{Red}{a})$Notations are color-coded with $\color{Red}{\text{Red}}$ for actions/utility, $\color{Green}{\text{Green}}$ for cost-related variables, $\color{#C0A0C0}{\text{Purple}}$ for revenue-related variables.

### 2. 🏎️Speed of Reaction Under Pressure (🧍‍♀️'s 🗺️)

The critical question that emerges is what determines the optimal processing speed for entrepreneurial decision-making in different contexts. Agrawal et al. (2021) demonstrates how entrepreneurs must choose between competing resource investment strategies - "control" (deep processing with protection) vs "execution" (rapid processing with learning), while Vul et al. (2014) shows mathematically why limited sampling can be optimal under resource constraints, with deeper processing warranted only when stakes are high or time costs are low. These insights reveal a fundamental tradeoff where faster processing enables more opportunity exploration while deeper processing yields higher precision. With this understanding of cognitive resource optimization in place, we can turn to examining how different environments determine the optimal balance between operational and market investments.

### 3. 🧭Direction of Rational Environment Adaptation (🌏's 🧭)

Understanding how different environments shape the optimal direction of cognitive resource investment requires examining how entrepreneurs maximize utility through sequential sampling from their posterior beliefs about cost-reduction and revenue-growth probabilities. Fine et al. (2022) demonstrates how industry structure systematically affects optimal resource allocation between operations and market development, while Phadnis and Fine (2017) shows systematic variation in operational demands across different value chain positions. Formally, entrepreneurs choose actions by solving $\underset{\color{Red}{a \in \{a_r, a_c\}}}{\arg\max} \sum \color{Red}{U}(\color{Green}{p_c^m} \color{#C0A0C0}{p_r^n}, \color{Red}{a})$ where $\color{Green}{p_c^m} \sim p(\color{Green}{p_c}\|D_c)$ and $\color{#C0A0C0}{p_r^n} \sim p(\color{#C0A0C0}{p_r}\|D_r)$ represent beliefs updated from environmental signals $\color{Green}{D_c} \sim Binom(T, p^0_c)$, $\color{#C0A0C0}{D_r} \sim Binom(T, p^0_r)$. Their work reveals that these environmental probabilities systematically vary based on product type (physical vs digital) and supply chain position (upstream vs downstream), which together determine the optimal operational-to-market investment ratio. These environmental influences on both direction and magnitude of resource allocation form the foundation for building a complete theory of adaptive entrepreneurial decision-making.



#### 🖼️fig1. Adapting agent & Lifting Agent-Belief to Agent-Belief-Desire-Environment
![[Pasted image 20241105000003.png|1000]]
The agent's decision-making process mirrors human strategic reasoning under uncertainty, where beliefs about operational (p_c) and market (p_r) ROIs are continuously updated through Bayesian inference. Rather than trying to discover "true" probabilities in the environment, the agent maintains and updates its beliefs about expected returns through direct observations (like cost savings from data acquisition or revenue growth signals from fleet expansion plans). At each decision point, the agent calculates expected utilities for both operational and market-focused actions using its current belief distributions, selects the action with higher expected utility, receives feedback in the form of cost and revenue signals, and updates its beliefs proportionally to signal intensity. This belief-updating mechanism enables the agent to adapt its operational-to-market investment ratio while refining the speed and confidence of its inference process.

### 4. Integration (🌏's 🗺️)

The final challenge is synthesizing these insights into practical guidance for entrepreneurs optimizing their cognitive resources in specific industry contexts. Cronin (2022) provides a framework for theory integration that helps structure how individual findings about resource-rational decision-making can be combined into a coherent whole, showing how knowledge itself can be cumulatively constructed. This integration enables us to provide entrepreneurs with concrete guidance for optimizing processing depth, setting appropriate operational-to-market investment ratios, and adapting to environmental demands. Looking ahead, future work will examine how these resource allocation patterns evolve as entrepreneurs learn and environments change over time.

Cronin (2024) explains we need balance between three complementing roles: Scientist (🧠) focuses on analytical understanding, prediction, and systematic control through evidence-based methods; the Artist (🤜) embodies creative imagination, generating novel possibilities and hope without immediate practical constraints; and the Judge (👓) evaluates actions and outcomes through the lens of ethics, norms, and values to ensure alignment with societal standards.
