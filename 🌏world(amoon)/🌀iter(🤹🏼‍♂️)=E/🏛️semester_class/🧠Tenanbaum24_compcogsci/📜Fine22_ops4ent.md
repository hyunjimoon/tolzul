Fine et al. (2022) proposes a structured progression for entrepreneurial operations by compartmentalizing the journey into three sequential phases‚Äî**Nailing**, **Scaling**, and **Sailing**‚Äã.  
This framework mirrors a **subpath-based formulation**: instead of trying to optimize the venture journey all at once (route-based) or just making isolated decisions (arc-based), it **modularizes entrepreneurial development into distinct phases**, each with different operational priorities and tools. "Nailing" focuses on rapid experimentation to establish a value proposition, "Scaling" emphasizes building repeatable and robust operational systems, and "Sailing" concentrates on continuous improvement within a matured organization.  
By treating each phase as a _subpath_, the complexity of modeling or managing the entrepreneurial process becomes tractable‚Äîallowing tighter operational focus within each phase while maintaining adaptability between phases. This mirrors the **time-space network optimization** in subpath-based routing: entrepreneurs optimize local subpaths (phases) and stitch them into a coherent venture evolution, avoiding the intractable complexity of full-path optimization.

 Abstract Although entrepreneurship-related papers have had some representation in Production and Operations Management (POM) over the past 30 years, the topic still seems a bit like a poor stepchild in the research of operations management (OM) scholars. Yet, entrepreneurship is important to the economy, and many schools are growing signiÔ¨Åcantly their entrepreneurship programs and offerings but often without reference to or inclusion of operations courses. This paper is motivated by the question of the operations needs of new ventures and how they might differ from the needs of large, established Ô¨Årms. Toward that end, we review brieÔ¨Çy the state of entrepreneurship scholarship in POM (and beyond), present our own (Ô¨Åeld-based) research (and cases), and propose a framework for what we call ‚Äúoperations for entrepreneurs,‚Äù that we hope can be a basis for further productive research and curriculum development by the OM community.

"under what conditions should marketing and product considerations preempt operations capabilities in startups and when should operations and capability development play a much more substantive role (and perhaps even a pre-eminent role) from Day 1?"

Sergey's master thesis: Managing operational capabilities in startup companies

Hundreds of papers exist on entrepreneurial marketing and finance, whereas capabilities for operations get far less attention. Furthermore, much of the literature in operations management addresses challenges of companies in stable environments, leaving entrepreneurs with little theoretical or practical guidance on operations strategy. As a result, many entrepreneurs focus their efforts on value creation: marketing, product development, lead generation, and conversion. Ironically, extreme focus on value creation might represent a trap, whereby a company fails not because of a poor value proposition or bad marketing, but because of an inability to scale up and deliver value for perhaps an outstanding, innovative new product or service. In over a dozen case studies written during the past four years, we have found numerous examples where the development of operational capabilities was a determining factor for success or failure in entrepreneurial firms. We study the effect of timing of introduction of operational capabilities on market success as a function of firm's value proposition. We provide case evidence on the challenges and opportunities of building operations capabilities in entrepreneurial firms and we construct theoretical and testable models for assessing when and why entrepreneurs should invest sooner, or later, in operational capabilities.
