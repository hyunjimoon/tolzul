abstract: Across many domains of decision making, people seem both rational and irrational. We review recent work that aims to reconcile these apparently contradictory views by modeling human decisions as optimal under a set of cognitive resource constraints. This ‚Äúresource-rational‚Äù analysis connects psychology and neuroscience to ideas from engineering, economics, and machine learning. Here, we focus on an information-theoretic formalization of cognitive resources, highlighting its implications for understanding three important and widespread phenomena: reference dependence, stochastic choice, and perseveration. While these phenomena have traditionally been viewed as irrational biases or errors, we suggest that they may arise from a rational solution to the problem of resource-limited decision making.

|Section/Subsection|Question|Answer|üß±Literature Brick|
|---|---|---|---|
|Introduction|How can we reconcile human rationality and irrationality?|üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Resource-rational analysis views human decisions as optimal under cognitive resource constraints, explaining both adaptive behavior and systematic limitations. This approach bridges psychology and neuroscience with concepts from engineering, economics, and information theory.|‚Ä¢ Bounded rationality (Simon 1956)<br>‚Ä¢ Ecological rationality (Todd & Gigerenzer 2003)<br>‚Ä¢ Computational rationality (Gershman et al. 2015)|
|Formalizing Efficiency|How can we mathematically model cognitive limitations?|üß≠ Cognition can be modeled as information transmission through a capacity-limited channel where efficiency emerges when representation fidelity is optimized given constraints. Three key objectives are: maximizing mutual information, minimizing squared loss, and maximizing reward, all subject to information capacity constraints.|‚Ä¢ Information theory (Cover & Thomas)<br>‚Ä¢ Rate-distortion theory<br>‚Ä¢ Capacity-limited decision making (Sims 2003)|
|Reference Dependence|Why do our judgments depend on context?|üåè Efficient coding requires neural resources to adapt to environmental statistics, making representations more sensitive to frequent values. The optimal representation with fixed output range follows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the stimulus distribution, explaining context effects in valuation and choice.|‚Ä¢ Efficient coding (Barlow 1961)<br>‚Ä¢ Decision by sampling (Stewart et al. 2006)<br>‚Ä¢ Range and rank normalization (Parducci 1995)|
|Stochastic Choice|Why are our choices sometimes inconsistent?|üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Stochasticity reflects an optimal trade-off between representational complexity and reward. When information is costly, choices become probabilistic, following a softmax distribution with bias toward frequently chosen actions, optimally balancing precision and cognitive cost.|‚Ä¢ Softmax/multinomial logit models<br>‚Ä¢ Sequential sampling models<br>‚Ä¢ Information-theoretic decision theory (Tishby & Polani 2011)|
|Perseveration|Why do we tend to repeat previous choices?|üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Under limited information capacity, choices become biased toward frequently selected actions across states. In dynamic settings, this manifests as perseveration‚Äîan adaptive behavior that optimizes the trade-off between exploring new information and exploiting existing knowledge.|‚Ä¢ Dynamic rational inattention (Steiner et al. 2017)<br>‚Ä¢ State abstraction in reinforcement learning<br>‚Ä¢ Noisy deliberation models|
|Conclusions|What are the broader implications of resource rationality?|üó∫Ô∏è Resource-rational analysis provides a unifying framework for understanding both rational and seemingly irrational behaviors. Rather than viewing biases as strange defects, they can be understood as sensible adaptations to cognitive constraints‚Äîconnecting judgment and decision-making with other core cognitive functions.|‚Ä¢ Information-theoretic cognitive science<br>‚Ä¢ Normative approaches to cognition<br>‚Ä¢ Rational analysis tradition|
