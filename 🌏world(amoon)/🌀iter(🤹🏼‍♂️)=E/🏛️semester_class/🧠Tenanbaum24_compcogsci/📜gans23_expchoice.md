This algorithm takes key parameters defining incumbents and entrants and produces the insights about their different experimental choices and resulting exploitation probabilities. It demonstrates how the paper's process generates the meaningful patterns that explain disruptive innovation from a new perspective.

I've verified that the updated PROCESS descriptions satisfy the reversibility conditions:

1. Given the inputs, applying the algorithms produces the outputs described
2. With the outputs, one could reconstruct the essential inputs
3. The outputs capture the comprehensive findings of the paper sections

For example, with the Algorithm_PatternIdentification, if you know the thresholds (pÃÇI, pÃÇE) and exploitation probabilities, you can work backward to determine the relative values of parameters that would produce these thresholds, thus reconstructing the essential information in the input.


This analysis highlights how Gans's paper represents a visionary contribution by fundamentally reframing our understanding of experimental choice in innovation. Rather than seeing high-bar experiments as mistakes that lead to disruption, the paper reveals them as rational strategic choices that maximize expected value given firms' different positions and predispositions. This paradigm shift challenges established thinking in the disruption literature while providing a mathematically rigorous foundation for future research and managerial guidance.

Experimental Choice and Disruptive Technologies

# 1. üëÅÔ∏èvisioning and ü§úinventing
## 1v. üëÅÔ∏èvision
This paper examines how a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs choice of the type of experiment impacts on its potential exploitation of new technological opportunities. It does so in the context of the failure of successful Ô¨Årms (or disruption) where the literature has informally suggested that Ô¨Årms undertake errors in experimental choice. It is shown that Ô¨Årms will generically choose experiments that minimize false positives (a high-bar) or minimize false negatives (a lowbar) rather than strike a balance between the two. This is done to better inform decisions regarding the exploitation of technological opportunities. It is shown that these choices can differ between incumbents and entrants based on their fundamentals and because of the anticipation of competition between them.

This table provides a cohesive summary where each row represents a complete research phase of the paper, and columns maintain consistent relationships. For example, the Research Question column consistently identifies the core inquiry motivating each section, while the Key Message column articulates the fundamental insight that addresses that question. The mathematical formalization provides the formal backbone supporting the theoretical arguments, creating a consistent column-wise structure. Row-wise, each section builds logically on previous ones, from model setup through implications for different firm types and competitive dynamics.

To see this, we continue the model from Section 3.1 by endogenising experimental choice. The experimental choice set is E ‚â° {Œª‚ÇÅ, Œª‚ÇÄ\|Œª‚ÇÅ + Œª‚ÇÄ ‚â§ Œõ}. Here, Œõ parameterises the scope or size of the experimental choice set. It is assumed that Œõ > 1 so all experiments are informative and Œõ < 2 so that the experimental set does not include the perfect experiment. The experimental choice set is depicted in Figure 3 and is bounded by the red line. For simplicity, it is assumed here that c = 0 and that the entrepreneur is constrained to select one experiment only from the set. blue lines represent two indifference lines for the entrepreneur's expected payoff.

When the entrepreneur is pre-disposed to exploit, they choose tŒª 1 , Œª 0 u ‚Äú t1, Œªu (where Œª ‚Äú Œõ ¬¥1). Gans (2023) terms this a ‚Äòlow-bar‚Äô experiment. This is because, for this experiment, it is very unlikely to generate bad news, but if it does, that news sends a clear (indeed, perfect signal) that it is not worthwhile to exploit the opportunity. Building a high-quality product to establish a beachhead is a strategy emphasised by Moore (2014). The idea is to target customer segments where you believe you can gain traction amongst lead users. This is a ‚Äòlow-bar‚Äô experiment because if you build a sufficiently strong product if that product does not succeed in that segment, this is a strong signal that it will not succeed more broadly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Incumbents vs. Entrants<br><br>We begin by considering the difference between incumbents and entrants and how this impacts on their experiment choices. Suppose that an entrant (E) can earn (gross) profits of œÄ if they successfully exploit the new technological opportunity and zero otherwise. The cost of entry is c (‚â§ œÄ). Given this, v^E_W = œÄ - c, v^E_N = -c and v^E_S = 0. By contrast, an incumbent (I) can earn (gross) profits of Œ† + Œî if they successfully exploit the new technological opportunity where Œ† are their preinnovation profits. It is also possible that trying to exploit the new technological opportunity is disruptive internally to the incumbent and thus costs the C regardless of whether that technology works or not. Finally, we assume that if it either does not exploit or exploits an opportunity that does not work, the incumbent earns Œ†. Given this, v^I_W = Œ† + Œî - C, v^I_N = Œ† - C and v^I_S = Œ†.<br><br>Given this, we can now prove a result showing a relationship between the type of experiments favored by entrants and incumbents and their differences.<br><br>**Proposition 2.** The range of p whereby an incumbent chooses a low-bar experiment (i.e., [pÃÇ,1]) becomes relatively larger (smaller) than the range for the entrant as c - C and/or Œî - œÄ increases (decreases).<br><br>This can be seen by substituting in the relevant v^I_W, v^I_N and v^I_S (i ‚àà {I,E}) into the equation for pÃÇ to give<br><br>pÃÇ_E = c/œÄ pÃÇ_I = C/Œî (1)<br><br>Thus, if C < c and Œî > œÄ, then pÃÇ_I < pÃÇ_E. If, however, either C < c and Œî < œÄ or C > c and Œî > œÄ, then the difference between incumbents' and entrants' experimental choices depends on the ratio of supply- and demand-side factors. This result only characterizes a difference in tendencies to adopt distinct experiments. However, for p very high or low, both firms opt for the same experimental choice. |

This example shows why: an optimistic angie will go to Yichen (to be sure if they should stop), a pessimistic angie will go to Charlie first (to be sure if they should proceed)
