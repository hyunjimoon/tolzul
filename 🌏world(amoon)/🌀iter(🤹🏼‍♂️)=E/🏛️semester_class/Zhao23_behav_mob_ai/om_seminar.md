- going to (18-24months to be done) product design too early
- iterate too long - should have buttoned up early

first instance is eliminating flexibility

explore the space (migrate into design solution) number of iteration increasing in the end back-loading can prolong the divergent/convergent design process

process discipline

effect of different tools (influence of digital design and it on modular product architecture)

modular architecture were infludenced by it

project success (27k parts) doesn't correlate with ??

information and 
project A (basecampe), project B (tool churn)

move onto sth else, us base 

design + in-design analysis (change in engineering appraoch)

product, process, tool, (centracity)

before (process steps, w.r.t. tech influenced best practice) -> after 

tools = automated but abstracted process specialized to some usecase?
digital tools may lead to inefficiency ()
without a discipline 

wrong concepts to use the tool; 
- cloud-based tool  vs process (facilitate - much faster), 
- scaling tools ()

omniscience (synthesize in process) - onshape
figma (adobe) - wireframe for ux/ui design / multi user cad (implicit assumption)

programming (2-3 team; new knowledge, don't know what limits are; multi-user (interface)) - version control (allowed sharing synchronously)
explore as much as we can (more people knowledge upfront)
- alter the divergent and convergent thinking  w
precursor to scaling (reject hypothesis);
