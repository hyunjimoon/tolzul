## day1.25 tom
Tom Malone, a professor from MIT, introduced the course on developing leadership capabilities, emphasizing practical experience and self-reflection. He outlined the course's structure, which includes understanding leadership styles, practicing leadership through team projects, and focusing on what's important. The course will cover four leadership capabilities: visioning, sense making, relating, and inventing. Students shared their perspectives on leadership, highlighting the importance of listening, adapting to environments, and leading by example. The session concluded with an exercise on identifying personal values and setting goals for the course, emphasizing the need for authenticity and effective communication. The meeting emphasized the importance of confidentiality in a class setting, particularly when discussing personal matters. The "Las Vegas rule" was explained, stating that anything shared in the class should remain confidential unless explicitly stated otherwise. Public discussions about general topics like current events are exempt. Participants were encouraged to err on the side of confidentiality, especially with private conversations. The rule was reaffirmed, and all attendees agreed to respect this ground rule to ensure a comfortable environment for sharing personal experiences.

## day1.5 l-cap wonda

The discussion focused on a leadership model developed by Sloan, emphasizing four core capabilities: visioning, sense making, relating, and inventing. The model is designed for a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, prioritizing flexibility and adaptability. Visioning involves creating aspirational, generative, and shared visions. Sense making requires understanding current realities and multiple perspectives. Relating involves building trust and respect with stakeholders. Inventing entails taking active steps to realize the vision, such as creating new processes or products. Participants were encouraged to self-assess their strengths and weaknesses in these areas and consider partnering with others to complement their skills. The conversation revolves around the concept of sense-making and its tangibility. Speaker 1 emphasizes that sense-making is a mental process involving individual and collective understanding. Angie.H Moon relates this to Martin Luther King's speech, highlighting how his words inspired and made sense to his audience. They discuss the integration of vision and sense-making, acknowledging that both are ongoing processes. Angie.H Moon aims to align her vision with Speaker 1's, who is skeptical but intrigued by the potential of her model. The discussion touches on the importance of persuading a committee for practical application and the need for operationalizing and mathematizing the model.

- concept called object, and he tries to explain how our desire, inner desire, affects how we view the world. So this part was the final purpose of our demand for an object is thus not the satisfaction of a need attached to it, but confirmation of the other's attitude toward us when, for example, a mother gives a milk to her milk a child, milk becomes a token of her love. The poor Tantalus does pays for his greed. So Tantalus was a like he explains it with Greek. The poor Tantalus does pays for his greed, his striving after exchange value, when every object he obtains loses his use value and changes into a pure, useless embodiment of exchange value the moment he buys it to food, it changes to gold. Yeah. So I think like the use value is your subjective satisfaction for something, and finance is one way to change or translate that use value in the exchange value. And I felt that the leadership capability is persuading that what we feel, what our group feel, is useful, has some exchange value as well. I wanted to share that with you.

[https://otter.ai/u/WxILixMIwqKRfya97lUj4qqfWmI?view=transcript](https://otter.ai/u/WxILixMIwqKRfya97lUj4qqfWmI?view=transcript)


### Choosing vs. Wanting

- Speaker 1 introduces the concept of making choices, differentiating between "I want" and "I choose."
- Speaker 3 mentions that wanting something is not always achievable, while choosing implies availability and decision-making.
- Speaker 2 elaborates that "I want" is passive, while "I choose" involves responsibility and commitment.
- Speaker 1 adds that sometimes we must choose the lesser of two evils and that choosing involves making a commitment.

### Defining Choice for the Exercise

- Speaker 1 explains that for the exercise, participants should use a specific definition of choice, where one can choose something even if it's not certain it's available.
- Speaker 1 gives the example of Gene Kranz from Apollo 13, who chose to bring the astronauts home alive despite not knowing if it was possible.
- The exercise aims to help participants choose visions, not just want them, and to make serious commitments.
- Speaker 1 emphasizes that choosing something in this sense gives one power and motivates efforts.

### Examples of Choosing Before Knowing Outcomes

- Speaker 1 shares examples of students choosing to attend MIT, often before they knew if they would get in.
- Speaker 3 and Speaker 4 discuss their experiences and efforts in preparing for and applying to MIT.
- Speaker 2 and Speaker 5 share their stories of deciding to apply to MIT, often after significant preparation and research.
- These examples illustrate that one can choose something before knowing if it's possible, and that such choices can be powerful.

### Exercise Instructions and Questions

- Speaker 1 instructs participants to stand up, pick a vision from their list, and read it aloud.
- The coach should help the reader think about the vision using four questions: Is it clear? Do you want it? Do you choose it? Are you sure this is your last chance?
- Speaker 1 explains that the exercise is about making serious commitments and choosing visions that matter.
- Participants are encouraged to be honest about their choices and to consider the implications of their decisions.

# day 3

three 🗿 stories
1. The first stone cutter was focused on earning money to support his family, seeing his work as just a job.
2. The second stone cutter took pride in being the best stone cutter and building a wall.
3. The third stone cutter understood the grand vision of building a cathedral, seeing his work as part of something bigger.
The key point is that as a leader, you don't always need to get everyone to see the grand vision you have. Instead, you can connect their individual personal visions to the larger shared vision. This allows you to create a shared sense of purpose, even if not everyone fully grasps the big picture.


1.  what did you want to achieve? Did you?
- interact with tom and wanda

2 . what are the three most important learnings? 
 - make friends to reinforce if this memories erode
- learning diverse vision THREE STONE stories (respectful for other people's value and choice)
- tom is amazing listener and wanda is amazing speaker (no one is perfect in all) framework + commentaries

1. commitments: 3 things you want to do as a result of experiences in this course
- analyzing with vsmi (purpose, perspective, people, process)
- going to pilates with sara and tiffany 
- flesh out my vision more (everyday - three paragraphs; sara; fleshing out the "living ergodic life" as markovian and calibrated choice (using tennis loop swing of doubting every information, trusting the causality only from you)

### work
1. "living ergodic life"

agents = belief desire
- equpping agent with calibrated choice algorithm
- equpping two agents having rational meaning construction algorithm
- exchanging belief via prior
- calibrating belief to evolving environment
- to acheive common goal

### relationship
ppl most important (quality to be true - outcomes)

1. trust, courage to push back, consistency, ability to express one's feeling (words, visuals)

### health 
- physical, mental, emotional, spiritual

health, weight loss

----

good leadership: fea

bad leadership: wrong time allocation

my desire is to be able to update my belief based on what i believe and desire; 


consistent - ppl can guess more - more trust; COMMITMENT CONSISTENT WITH VALUE

means to an end (ways to accomplish values); being a leader is getting what's most important

| Aspect | Cooking Example | Tennis Example | Theoretical Framework | Can it be Markovian? |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Learning Method | Recipe following vs. understanding cooking principles | Mimicking champion's posture vs. understanding swing mechanics | Prior information vs. installed beliefs | Yes - current state (skill level) depends only on previous state and action |
| Practice Effect | Each cooking attempt improves understanding | Each swing practice builds muscle memory | Each experiment updates beliefs | Yes - learning progress is step-by-step |
| Success Measure | Food tastes good consistently | Consistent good shots | Well-calibrated predictions | Yes - performance at each point depends on current skill state |
| Understanding Level | Knowing why ingredients work together | Knowing why swing mechanics work | Understanding causal mechanisms | Partially - deep understanding may require memory of multiple past states |
| Transfer Skills | Can cook new dishes without recipes | Can adapt technique to different shots | Can apply framework to new situations | Partially - skill transfer might need memory of learning process |

## markovian
Imagine you're learning to play tennis. When you're just starting, there are two kinds of "not knowing" - things you could learn with practice (like how to swing your racket in that perfect loop motion) and things that will always be a bit random (like how the wind might affect your serve or how the ball might hit the net tape). The cool part is that your next shot mostly depends on what you know right now - your current serving technique - and not so much on how you learned it last month. That's what we call "Markovian" - when your next step mainly depends on where you are right now. You can either just copy how champions hold their racket (which might work quickly but won't help you understand), or you can learn why that loop swing works (which takes longer but helps you improve more). Just like champions didn't become great overnight, getting better at tennis means understanding what parts of the game you can improve through practice and what parts will always need quick adjustments based on the moment.


# Markovian Analysis of Prior Information and Uncertainty

## 1. Prior Information vs. Belief

| Component           | Non-Markovian (History-Dependent)                           | Markovian (State-Dependent)                   | Link to Action Selection                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Prior Distribution  | Full $P(S \mid D)$ with historical context and dependencies | $P(S \mid D)$, Agent's Digestion Level) tuple | argmax Σ u(a,s) where $s \sim P(S \mid D)$       |
| Digestion Level     | Accumulation of past experiences and understanding          | Current comprehension state                   | Action selected based on current digestion state |
| Information Content | Historical path of learning and updates                     | Current state sufficient statistics           | Action depends only on current information state |


## 2. Uncertainty Decomposition

| Type | Property | Markovian Representation | Action Implication |
|------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Irreducible (Blue) | Random elements known only to nature | Current state randomness | Actions must account for inherent variability |
| Reducible (Green) | Potentially knowable but unknown | Current knowledge gaps | Actions can reduce uncertainty |
| Knowledge (Red) | Currently known elements | Current state knowledge | Actions based on known elements |

## 3. State Transitions and Information Flow

```
Non-Markovian:
Past States → Current State → Future States
     ↑            ↑              ↑
Full History   Full Context   Path Dependent

Markovian:
Current State = (P(S|D), Digestion Level, Knowledge Type)
     ↓
Next State = f(Current State, Action, New Observation)
```

## 4. Action Selection Process

1. Markovian Case:
   - State: (P(S|D), Digestion=d)
   - Action: argmax Σ u(a,s) where s ~ P(S|D)
   - Next State: Only depends on current state and action

2. Non-Markovian Case:
   - State: Full history of P(S|D) and learning path
   - Action: Depends on full learning history
   - Next State: Depends on full history of states and actions
