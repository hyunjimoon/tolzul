Develop leadership skills needed in today’s increasingly decentralized organizations through conceptual discussions, small group exercises, and self-reflection. We emphasize skill-building around key leadership capabilities: sensemaking, relating, visioning, and inventing. Apply leadership concepts to evaluate your own strengths and weaknesses and understand better your values and aspirations as a leader.
