nested logit 
- know apriori or diagnose from data (coefficient scale up when comparing MNL vs flat only)
- infinite scale = deterministic choice = high similarity among subchoices (corr() = 1-mu^2/mu_d^2)
- simulation (within the range of known parameter) vs forecasting (with new price)

Swissmetro: SM's appeal persists, especially for low-income users; high-income users react more to price changesâ€”counterintuitive insight.
Telephone Plans: Flat plans suffer after price hikes; BM (Budget Measured) gains across all segments. Policy impact is more pronounced among low-income users.
