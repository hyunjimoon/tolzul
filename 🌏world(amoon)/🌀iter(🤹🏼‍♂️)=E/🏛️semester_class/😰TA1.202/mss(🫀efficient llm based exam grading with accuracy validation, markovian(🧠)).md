## Current State (Sₜ)

**Student List**: jiarui, xinling, chenan, yuhan, adam, donghang, hanyong, jae, hanyang, ziyan, eve, amelia, summer, bianchi, niaz, deniz, shogo, hirotaka, pierre, david

**Question 3 Structure & Key Answers** (20 points total):

- 3a (5pts): Rational likelihood = ∏ᵀₜ₌₁ ∏ᵢ∈{Dell,Mac} P^yᵢₙₜᵢₙₜ,rational where Pᵢₙₜ,rational = e^Vᵢₙₜ/(e^VDell,nt + e^VMac,nt)
- 3b (3pts): Random likelihood = 1/2^T (since Pᵢₙₜ,random = 1/2)
- 3c (5pts): Law of total probability: Pᵢₙₜ = πrational·Pᵢₙₜ,rational + πrandom·Pᵢₙₜ,random
- 3d (2pts): Binary logit: Pn,rational = e^Vn,rational/(e^Vn,rational + e^Vn,random)
- 3e (5pts): Substitute 3d into 3c, then apply product form

**Question 4 Structure & Key Answers** (15 points total):

- 4a (5pts): Show β̂₁ and β̂₀ unchanged on D₂ using algebraic manipulation of means and sums
- 4b (5pts): Variance decreases by factor of 2, narrower CI₂ ⊂ CI₁, so reject H₀ on D₂
- 4c (2pts): Perfect multicollinearity since ln(x²) = 2ln(x)
- 4d (3pts): Two violations: εᵢ not mean zero (systematic underreporting), εᵢ not independent (time correlation)

**Question 5 Structure & Key Answers** (10 points total):

- 5a (2pts): Method 1: Add βmale·MALE to car utility, test βmale=0; Method 2: Market segmentation test across gender
- 5b (2pts): Filter WHO=2, test βcost=0 vs βcost<0 (one-sided)
- 5c (3pts): Create rail nest (SM+Train), normalize root scale=1, test nest scale≠1
- 5d (3pts): Filter WHO=1 & PURPOSE=1; Method 1: Add cost×income interactions; Method 2: Income segmentation test

## Objective Function (Oₜ)

Minimize grading errors while maximizing consistency across students Subject to: Each student gets fair evaluation based on their actual written work across all three questions

## Knowledge Extraction Matrix

g₁: Mathematical Rigor → MSS = "Full points require correct mathematical expressions with proper notation" g₂: Conceptual Understanding → MSS = "Partial credit for correct approach with minor errors" g₃: Blank Detection → MSS = "Zero points if no substantive work shown for any sub-question" g₄: Cross-Question Consistency → MSS = "Student performance patterns should be consistent across questions" g₅: Method Recognition → MSS = "Award points for identifying correct statistical/econometric methods even if execution flawed"

## Required Output Format

For each student, provide:

```
StudentName: 
Q3: [3a_score/5, 3b_score/3, 3c_score/5, 3d_score/2, 3e_score/5] = Total/20
Q4: [4a_score/5, 4b_score/5, 4c_score/2, 4d_score/3] = Total/15  
Q5: [5a_score/2, 5b_score/2, 5c_score/3, 5d_score/3] = Total/10
Reasoning: "Brief justification for any partial/zero scores"
```

## Next State (Sₜ₊₁)

**Grading Protocol**:

1. For each student in reverse order, locate their responses for Questions 3, 4, and 5
2. Compare written work against key answer components for each sub-question
3. Apply MSS decision rules consistently across all questions
4. Flag inconsistent response patterns
5. Generate comprehensive scores with confidence indicators

**Activation**: "Begin systematic grading of Questions 3, 4, and 5 for all 20 students, starting with jiarui and proceeding through the reverse-ordered list, comparing each student's actual written work against the mathematical and conceptual requirements for each sub-question."
