Use Prof. Rogers' need to maintain a good reputation in academia to negotiate the percentage down to 0.25% post-money, which is more in line with typical advisory grants.<br><br>Leverage "potential buyer's perspective" that they are not happy. Typical advisory grant is less than 1%, but in this case 0.25% post-money would be adequate as the contribution was limited. |



| Key Concept                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                            | Effect of Clockspeed                                                                                                                                               | Effect of Tech Deepness                                                                                                                                              |

| Founder Vesting             | The process by which founders' shares become available over time, typically tied to their continued involvement with the company.                                     | In fast clockspeed industries, shorter vesting periods may be preferred to align with the rapid pace of change and to incentivize quick execution.                 | Deep tech startups may require longer vesting periods to account for the extended development timelines and to ensure founder commitment.                            |
| Option Pool                 | A portion of a company's shares reserved for future issuance to employees, directors, and consultants as incentives.                                                  | Fast clockspeed industries may require larger option pools to attract and retain talent in a competitive market.                                                   | Deep tech startups may have smaller option pools due to lower employee turnover and longer development cycles.                                                       |
| Board of Directors          | A group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and oversee the management of a company.                                                                     | In fast clockspeed industries, boards may need to be more agile and meet more frequently to adapt to the rapid pace of change.                                     | Deep tech startups may benefit from having board members with specialized technical expertise to guide the company's long-term technology strategy.                  |
| Mandatory Conversion Clause | A provision that requires the automatic conversion of preferred stock to common stock upon certain triggering events, such as an IPO.                                 | Fast clockspeed industries may have lower thresholds for mandatory conversion to align with the expectation of faster exits and liquidity events.                  | Deep tech startups may have higher thresholds for mandatory conversion due to the longer timelines required to achieve significant valuation milestones.             |
| Accruing Dividends          | A provision that grants investors the right to receive accumulated dividends on their preferred stock, often in the event of a liquidation or other triggering event. | In fast clockspeed industries, investors may prefer non-accruing dividends to prioritize growth and reinvestment over immediate returns.                           | Deep tech startups may be more likely to accept accruing dividends due to the longer investment horizons and the need to attract patient capital.                    |
| No Shop                     | A clause that prohibits a company from soliciting or considering alternative investment offers for a specified period after signing a term sheet.                     | Fast clockspeed industries may have shorter no-shop periods to accommodate the rapid pace of dealmaking and to minimize the risk of missed opportunities.          | Deep tech startups may be more willing to accept longer no-shop periods due to the specialized nature of their technology and the limited pool of investors.         |
| Lawyers' Fees               | The responsibility for paying legal expenses associated with a financing round, typically assigned to either the company or the investors.                            | In fast clockspeed industries, companies may be more likely to push for investors to cover their own legal fees to conserve cash for rapid growth and development. | Deep tech startups may be more willing to cover legal fees as a show of good faith and to build strong relationships with investors who understand their technology. |
| Founders' Reps              | Representations and warranties made by founders regarding the company's ownership of intellectual property and other key assets.                                      | Fast clockspeed industries may require more stringent founders' reps to mitigate the risk of intellectual property disputes in a rapidly evolving market.          | Deep tech startups may need to provide more detailed founders' reps to demonstrate the novelty and defensibility of their proprietary technology.                    |
