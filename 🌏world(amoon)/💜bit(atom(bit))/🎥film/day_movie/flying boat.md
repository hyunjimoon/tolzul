airplane is the only vessel of freedom with responsibility -- so it's existential machine

- transending mundane
- flying is drug of choice
- nothing happens until something moves - einstein
- people can hardly grasp what's change 
- motion seems to be the theme of 20th centry and with motion comes aspiration
- sky-scrapor were icon of aspiration; my only problem was there were no runways
- harbours have infinite takeoff and infinite landing platform
