Previously,on  
"Super Pumped"...  
  
Young founders  
are a hot commodity.  
  
You must basically have  
women on demand now too.  
  
Yeah, we call that  
Boober.  
  
Olivia Lungociu  
just published  
  
our entire list of  
data access permissions.  
  
Everyone will know that  
we access  
  
users' messages, cameras,  
contacts, GPS,  
  
even after the app's  
been closed.  
  
Olivia Lungociu.  
  
Open her up quick  
and quiet.  
  
  
  
She needs to be fucking  
neutralized.  
  
I'm going to stay  
in the city tonight.  
  
Can't you come home?  
  
I've gotta get  
an early start.  
  
The money is worthless  
if I never see you.  
  
Quality time in the dark  
isn't so great  
  
when I can't pay  
the electricity bill.  
  
Thanks for all you do,  
brother.  
  
Is Google starting  
a self-driving  
  
ride-hailing service?  
  
Anything is possible.  
  
That's Levandowski.  
I want to poach him.  
  
I just sent Google  
my resignation letter.  
  
Why don't you meet  
our newest board member.  
  
  
  
I am thrilled by  
Uber's potential  
  
to make the world  
a better place.  
  
Apple just rejected  
the update.  
  
Your build breaks  
dozens of App Store rules.  
  
It's an abomination.  
  
Change it.  
  
Anyone looking at Uber's app  
  
from Cupertino  
  
won't be able to see  
the privacy-violating code.  
  
Do it.  
  
Tim, you're not gonna believe  
  
the shit Uber's trying to pull.  
  
Opening theme music plays  
  
- Hey.  
- Oh, Jesus.  
  
Hi.  
  
Did they ever play any  
happy songs back in the day,  
  
or are they all just like  
funeral dirges?  
  
Okay, they had a lot of people  
dying on them back then.  
  
- Young too.  
- But they also played, like,  
  
imperial shit, right,  
like for kings?  
  
Can you play me  
something like that?  
  
Guess someone  
had a good day at work.  
  
I did. I had a great  
fucking day.  
  
Good. Why don't you go shower  
  
that Johnnie Walker  
and patchouli off of you...  
  
- And then we can...  
- No time, babe.  
  
Too busy changing the world.  
One driver less car at a time.  
  
That's amazing, Trav.  
Hey, I have some good news too.  
  
Really? So we're going  
to celebrate you too.  
  
But do you know where  
the Wii remote is?  
  
'Cause I can feel it right now.  
I am en fuego.  
  
It's in the cabinet  
under the TV.  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
Anyway, so, you...  
You know that school  
  
that I've been working with?  
  
They...  
  
Yeah. Eddy Cue!  
  
I was legit just talking  
about you, man.  
  
What's going on?  
  
We have a real problem.  
  
You do, I mean. Uber does.  
An existential crisis.  
  
Define "existential."  
  
Tim's sitting in  
to decide if you exist.  
  
Cupertino, tomorrow.  
  
They can't know.  
  
They obviously know  
  
we're still running  
the rejected code,  
  
or else the call I got would've  
been inviting me to their camp  
  
at the Bohemian Club,  
  
not to reenact  
The Lives of Others  
  
with Tim Cook  
asking the questions.  
  
Is this it, man?  
Is Apple banning us?  
  
Oh, they're just trying  
to scare us, or scare me.  
  
It could be seen like  
we're deceiving  
  
the most powerful tech company  
in the world, TK...  
  
And we have no idea  
how much Apple actually knows.  
  
Their find could expose heaven,  
hell, Grey ball.  
  
Our whole surveillance  
operation.  
  
- We don't call it that.  
- Okay,  
  
none of those things  
are actually illegal.  
  
Apple's precious App Store rules  
are not the fucking law.  
  
Most users are dubious  
of the data we mine  
  
from their phones already.  
  
Discovering blatant  
privacy infringement  
  
could drive users off the app  
and the company.  
  
We have to make this right  
with Apple.  
  
Thank you, Mr. Spock.  
Now what do I do?  
  
What's my angle? How do I  
actually get out of this?  
  
You don't.  
  
Leave the bullshit  
on the farm.  
  
Go to Cupertino.  
  
Confirm only  
what they know.  
  
Nothing more, nothing less.  
And then say you're sorry.  
  
I'm not sorry.  
  
And I don't want to let Tim  
wrestle me to the ground.  
  
TK, you know when it comes  
to throwing gas on a fire,  
  
I'm both the gas and the fire,  
right?  
  
- Why I love you, bro.  
- But this time,  
  
I got some water  
and a fire extinguisher  
  
because big pic:  
Saying sorry costs nothing.  
  
You're on track to become  
  
the most significant commander  
  
of the most significant start up  
  
of the 21st century.  
  
Legit legend status.  
  
If we don't get flushed.  
  
This could be  
that rare time  
  
where the truth actually  
sets you free.  
  
The concern is, if you don't  
give them what they want,  
  
which is, as Emil said,  
the truth,  
  
they will make an example of you  
and ban the app, ending Uber.  
  
But know this:  
  
If they don't like that truth,  
they may ban us anyway.  
  
So I tell the truth, I lose,  
  
but I lie, I also lose?  
  
One of those will be  
the better option.  
  
Choose that one,  
  
or else Cupertino  
will become your Waterloo.  
  
Well, I hear you.  
I regard you.  
  
But this is nothing  
like Waterloo, okay?  
  
Napoleon was a great general.  
I'm not knocking the little man.  
  
But he was not making France  
the kind of coin  
  
that I am making for Apple,  
  
which is why Apple will never  
remove Uber from the app store.  
  
I think we have to remove Uber  
from the App Store.  
  
In all my years at Apple,  
  
I've never seen such a blatant  
disregard for Apple policy.  
  
Your juvenile, contemptuous  
game of hide-and-seek  
  
with our compliance engineers  
is an insult.  
  
If insults determined  
our actions,  
  
we'd be tossing apps  
to the lions like the emperors.  
  
This isn't personal to me,  
but it is clear, Travis.  
  
Your actions,  
and those of your company,  
  
have led us  
to one conclusion:  
  
Uber must go.  
  
Anything you'd like to say?  
  
Before you do, know this:  
  
Lying, that I do  
take personally.  
  
Oh, look at that.  
  
Our main motherfucker  
would love to find a lie  
  
that he could float.  
  
Uber deserves to be removed  
from the App Store.  
  
Uber...  
  
No, I deceived you.  
  
It was blatant and egregious.  
  
But I was desperate.  
  
Well, this tribunal  
can close up fast.  
  
No, I'm saying that there's  
a reason I did what I did.  
  
Before you end it all  
for Uber...  
  
just hear me out.  
  
I think you owe me that.  
  
We owe you nothing.  
  
That may well be true, Eduardo,  
  
but Travis is here,  
and so are we.  
  
Let's let the man talk.  
  
Thank you, Tim.  
  
Oh, no.  
  
He's right, Travis.  
  
I mean, we should  
shut you down  
  
faster than the Secretariat did  
  
the field at Churchill Downs.  
  
They say that race was over  
in the first furlong.  
  
Yeah, well, I run motherfuckers  
down in the final stretch, Eddy.  
  
Hey, try and rise above  
the day-to-day, uh, chestiness.  
  
Hey, and just tell us why  
on earth you thought it was okay  
  
to blatantly violate  
our agreement.  
  
I'm here today  
because of China.  
  
Oh, God...  
  
From humble beginnings  
in San Francisco...  
  
...Uber took over the world  
in record time.  
  
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it  
  
That's the way,  
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it  
  
But there was  
still one land left  
  
to be annexed  
into Uber Nation.  
  
The People's Republic of China.  
  
A land of 1.4 billion people,  
  
97% of whom own a smart phone.  
  
If we could take China,  
  
we would be the most  
consequential tech start up  
  
since Apple.  
  
But we had competition.  
  
There were already two big  
Chinese ride share companies:  
  
Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache.  
  
They were at war.  
  
That was my opening  
to conquer China.  
  
And we were winning.  
  
Take Chengdu.  
  
Half the size of New York City,  
  
but 479 times as many rides  
in less than nine months.  
  
But, and I've never  
told anybody this,  
  
not even my board.  
  
Half of those rides were fake.  
  
Each centipede  
represents, at minimum,  
  
50 fraudulent  
incentive rides.  
  
And there are hundreds more in  
every city all over the country,  
  
all day every day.  
  
Doing, what, 116,000 rides  
a day in Chengdu.  
  
Average cost of a ride's  
97 yuans,  
  
15 bucks per ride  
times 20 cities.  
  
Jesus, we're losing 25 million  
a week on this shit...  
  
to fraud in China  
because of Apple.  
  
You saying your fraud problem  
was Apple's fault?  
  
I'm saying we're providing  
career opportunities to drivers,  
  
a superior brand to riders.  
  
And they pay us back  
  
by coming up with elaborate  
scams to rip us off.  
  
And there's nothing we could do  
to stop them.  
  
Until recently,  
  
every phone had the equivalent  
of a digital signature.  
  
Uber could use those signatures  
to track the scammers.  
  
But when you guys killed  
  
outside access  
to the signatures,  
  
then Uber lost the ability  
  
to identify  
the fraudulent accounts.  
  
When you blocked that access,  
  
you blinded us  
like fucking Equus.  
  
And, yes, then we had  
to cut open some new eye holes...  
  
That's a pretty Orwellian way  
to say that you decided  
  
to flout our privacy policy  
like a bunch of...  
  
I have nothing but respect for  
Apple's commitment to privacy.  
  
Ugh.  
  
I...  
  
understand Apple's commitment  
to privacy.  
  
But my commitment is to Uber.  
  
I'm duty-bound as CEO  
to protect my company.  
  
Even against you.  
  
One of my engineers  
figured out a new way  
  
to identify  
the fraudulent users.  
  
The new software turns user data  
in, like, text messages,  
  
contacts, photo albums,  
et cetera,  
  
into a unique fingerprint.  
  
Once the phone's  
been fingerprinted,  
  
Uber can track it.  
  
Oh, shit, yes!  
  
- Fuck you guys! We got you!  
- Nice!  
  
Fuck you fuckers!  
  
I was in for a bil in China,  
going on two.  
  
But I was about to do what only  
Musk and you guys have done.  
  
What Zuckerberg and Brin  
and Bezos couldn't.  
  
Get China.  
  
China doesn't play  
by the same rules.  
  
We can't let them  
make that choice.  
  
And we have it.  
  
We've got China  
under control.  
  
You got our letter  
to the board.  
  
Two cities have 400 times  
as many rides  
  
as New York in nine months.  
  
It's unprecedented.  
  
So is your burn rate.  
  
Our burn is commensurate  
with growth.  
  
Everyone on the board  
got that same letter. They're  
  
all fine with it. Know how I  
know? It's like guard dogs.  
  
If they sense something's  
wrong, they bark.  
  
But we haven't heard a peep  
from them.  
  
Have you heard anything  
from anybody, Bill?  
  
We're here on behalf  
of Benchmark.  
  
On behalf of our limited  
partners.  
  
Uh-huh, and Emil, what is  
Uber's valuation as of today?  
  
Thirty bill-yone.  
  
So you can tell your LPs  
that's 300 times return.  
  
When and if we go public.  
  
And that "if" is if  
this China insanity  
  
doesn't wipe us out first.  
  
I'm not in the business  
of wiping out.  
  
And that's what  
the fat surfer said  
  
in the "Eddie Would Go" T-shirt  
  
right before  
a 30-meter monster  
  
sends him to the ocean floor  
at Nazaré.  
  
He brought a short board...  
  
Look, let's just  
take a breath here.  
  
Everybody has faith in you  
  
that you know  
what's on your balance sheet,  
  
but revenue is not profit,  
  
despite contortionist  
accounting.  
  
We'll have all the profit  
we need  
  
once we win China.  
  
You have rolled across Europe  
like Rommel himself.  
  
With the same elegant fury.  
  
But China ain't France.  
  
China's playing mah-jongg  
while you're playing pétanque.  
  
Different cultures  
need different strategies.  
  
We just need you to see  
the whole game board here.  
  
I am the one on the game board,  
and I'm crushing it.  
  
China loves Uber.  
  
Whatever happened  
to grow or die?  
  
In China, it's grow, then die.  
  
- Dude...  
- China loves us today  
  
because we give more value than  
what we charge,  
  
because we're depositing  
incentives out the wazoo.  
  
It's a free fucking  
cash bonanza.  
  
What's there not to love?  
  
But Uber is always gonna be  
an interloper from the west.  
  
And once we get a foothold  
and profitability,  
  
start withdrawing yuan  
out of their economy,  
  
the CCP is gonna cut us off  
at the knees.  
  
And they're going to take  
the business  
  
that Travis Kalanick built,  
  
and they're going to give us  
back in return nothing.  
  
Not even a fortune cookie.  
  
Don't fucking do that.  
  
You know, Arianna says,  
  
"You never get to witness  
your own eulogy,  
  
but you write it  
every day."  
  
I think she's wrong,  
'cause I'm witnessing  
  
my own eulogy.  
  
And you're the one writing it.  
  
Some people write words  
for a living.  
  
Do you think...  
  
Others write checks.  
  
...that I can win in China?  
  
Yes or no?  
  
Because Arianna does.  
  
She believes in me.  
  
She believes in Uber.  
  
And that is worth more  
than all the money in Benchmark.  
  
We're staying in China.  
  
Rise back up  
to consciousness.  
  
That was fabulous,  
darling.  
  
Your vibration  
is much higher.  
  
Can you feel it?  
  
Yeah, I totally can.  
  
Bill Gurley has invited me  
to breakfast Monday.  
  
- Can you come?  
- You know what?  
  
He asked me to mentor  
one of his CEOs on Monday.  
  
That's convenient.  
  
There are no accidents.  
  
And there are no secrets  
between us.  
  
Thank you.  
  
At least some people  
were still on my side.  
  
Shit.  
  
But even her support  
  
couldn't stop the hits  
from coming.  
  
What?  
  
We've got tragic news.  
  
One of our Uber drivers  
killed a child in Ohio.  
  
Oh, Jesus.  
This is going to suck for me.  
  
Suck for... for Uber,  
is what I mean.  
  
I know it sucks  
for the family too.  
  
Obviously it sucks for them.  
  
Twitter's blowing up about it  
right now.  
  
Olivia Lungociu's  
leading the charge.  
  
Her.  
  
When you are going to admit  
you just don't give a fuck?"  
  
Come on.  
It's not like her kid died.  
  
- No. No, no, no.  
- TK.  
  
Don't ever let anyone  
other than me  
  
hear you say  
something like that.  
  
You know what?  
Elon could say it.  
  
They'd put it on a billboard.  
They would celebrate.  
  
I need some Musk on me.  
Isn't that your job?  
  
Why don't I get the press  
he gets?  
  
Because they don't know you.  
  
If they knew the Travis I do,  
  
they'd say nothing  
but wonderful things.  
  
Arianna's right.  
  
You hide behind comms  
  
when you should be out front  
communicating.  
  
Elon is rocket man because  
he gives the press face time.  
  
Makes them feel special.  
  
Yeah, they celebrate him,  
as you said.  
  
Travis, you can and should  
do this.  
  
Let's host a press event  
in New York.  
  
At the Waverly,  
and I'll co-host.  
  
Great.  
Steaks, wine, conversation.  
  
Get the media on team TK.  
  
Yeah. I like it.  
  
I don't know.  
  
Kissing up to the press,  
  
it just doesn't feel legit.  
  
An event might help with  
the calls I've been getting  
  
from journos digging  
into our burn in China.  
  
And the last thing we need  
before a new raise  
  
is the press casting doubt  
on your judgment as CEO.  
  
I don't need the press.  
You know how I know?  
  
The graphs tell me so,  
  
'cause they are nothing  
but up and to the right.  
  
Shitty tweet  
up and to the right.  
  
Bad headline  
up and to the right.  
  
All I do is grow.  
  
I'm the fucking  
Revenue Rocket Man.  
  
Why...?  
  
Why can't people  
report on that  
  
instead of always being like,  
  
"Why women hate working  
at Uber"?  
  
Give me a fucking break.  
  
Moving on...  
  
No, let's not move on.  
  
I'd like to know why women  
hate working at Uber.  
  
That seems super germane to your  
pattern of behavior, Travis.  
  
Why is your attrition rate  
for women so high?  
  
From my experience,  
  
women are the canary  
in the coal mine.  
  
When they leave a company  
en masse,  
  
that's often a sign of deeper,  
  
overlooked cultural  
and ethical issues.  
  
We are always looking  
for qualified workers  
  
with the right attitude.  
  
If you're good,  
you're hired.  
  
And if you get it,  
  
then you stick  
regardless of gender.  
  
You believe that?  
  
It's not about belief, Tim.  
I can see our data.  
  
Data can be biased.  
  
So can people.  
  
Anyway, I think I've more  
than answered your question.  
  
Oh, no, this inquiry  
is just getting started.  
  
You'll answer for every aspect  
of your company  
  
before I decide if you stay  
alive and in the store.  
  
Okay, well,  
if you're judge and jury,  
  
then may I continue  
my testimony?  
  
Sure. Start with an answer  
to Tim's question.  
  
Why are your attrition rates  
for women so high?  
  
It is imperative you do  
a temple stay at Bongeunsa  
  
when you're in Seoul  
with Gabi.  
  
It will balance your chi.  
  
- That sounds amazing.  
- Hmm.  
  
Hold the elevator.  
  
- Can I say one more thing?  
- Yes.  
  
What should I do about  
this constant questioning  
  
of our accounting  
practices?  
  
Don't break any rules  
or laws.  
  
And if Gurley keeps  
coming at you about it,  
  
just tell him to kiss  
your EBITDA.  
  
- Thank you!  
- Of course.  
  
I'll tell you why the attrition  
rate for women at Uber  
  
is so high.  
  
Isaiah Berlin wrote:  
I wish to be the subject,  
  
not the object of my life.  
  
Couldn't have said it better.  
  
So, let me introduce myself.  
  
My name is Susan Fowler.  
  
You'll remember me as  
the site reliability engineer  
  
who was sexually harassed on  
her first day of work at Uber.  
  
Anne-Marie in HR suggested  
I find a new team.  
  
Her way of telling me to quit.  
  
But I've come  
too far to quit.  
  
So, after months of floating  
in Uber limbo,  
  
I found a new team.  
  
And it's a great one.  
  
And I wish people  
Liked me more  
  
All I did  
Was try my best...  
  
That's my new manager, Kevin.  
  
I chose his team  
because it's 25% women,  
  
which, paltry as it is,  
  
is the highest ratio  
in the company.  
  
If we can split our monolith  
in under three months,  
  
every person on the team  
will get this dope jacket.  
  
Check it out, dude.  
  
A monolith is a block  
of thousands of lines  
  
of Uber's operating code.  
  
The goal is to separate  
and reorganize  
  
the block of code  
into individual lines  
  
called "micro services."  
  
They make the code easier  
to access and repair  
  
should it malfunction.  
  
TLDR, I'm a techie Marie Kondo.  
  
And coffee brings me joy.  
  
So does my job.  
  
"Job" doesn't even seem like  
enough of a supercharged word  
  
for how I view what I do.  
  
It's more of a mission.  
  
I obsess about it so much,  
  
I started writing about it  
on my blog:  
  
I even wrote a book about  
my experiences as an SRE.  
  
It's a bestseller on Amazon.  
  
HR's reaming me,  
said my team's too homogenous.  
  
Ideological diversity  
doesn't count.  
  
How do you keep them  
on your team?  
  
Trade secrets.  
And if I keep it  
  
above 23.4% female,  
it's Tesla time.  
  
All the ladies love Kev.  
  
Really, seriously,  
fuck you.  
  
Fowler, perfect score  
on your performance review.  
  
Making me look good.  
  
Appreciate it. I owe you.  
  
I could use your approval  
on my application  
  
for manager of SRE II.  
  
Once you finish the monolith,  
no doubt.  
  
Thanks, Kev.  
  
Kevin's great,  
but he hasn't inured me  
  
to the realities  
of working here.  
  
I could call it out.  
  
I could make up  
20 small-dick jokes  
  
and hurl them  
at the likely offenders.  
  
Better to just  
make it disappear.  
  
But this, the old familiar  
ass ogling,  
  
that I cannot erase.  
  
So I get to report that to HR.  
  
Again.  
  
Not that they'll respond.  
  
Here's a descriptor that's going  
to land like a giant turd:  
  
"Toxic."  
  
I'm the first to admit "toxic"  
has lost all meaning  
  
in the general sense.  
  
That's why we have to tell  
our stories.  
  
The specifics matter,  
  
because each specific  
is another human  
  
pushed that much closer  
to the edge.  
  
Take Alison, a kick ass engineer  
from Cal Tech.  
  
She's leaving  
because her team leader  
  
constantly double-checks  
her work.  
  
He says she's too hot  
to be a good engineer.  
  
I got this feeling  
  
On the summer day  
When you were gone  
  
I crashed my car  
Into the bridge  
  
I watched  
I let it I burn  
  
I threw your shit  
Into a bag...  
  
Fran didn't even come back  
to the office  
  
the day after her team  
held an all-hands  
  
at an all-nude strip club,  
and they dubbed her No Fun Fran.  
  
Grace is such  
a brilliant programmer.  
  
She's had her work stolen  
by our SVP five times.  
  
Each time she reported it,  
  
he thanked her for taking one  
for the team,  
  
then promoted mediocre men  
over her.  
  
Understandably,  
she lost her shit.  
  
Now she's "crazy."  
  
Literally half of you  
are looking at me  
  
like I am the most  
strict-slash-least fun teacher  
  
you had in middle school.  
  
I just ruined your fucking  
tree house club at recess  
  
when I found  
your dirty magazines.  
  
I make you remember  
  
how you had to push down  
your damned hard-ons  
  
or whatever in your corduroys  
and go back to class.  
  
But the other half of you,  
well, sure,  
  
some of you are  
the get-along-to-go-along types  
  
and would like me  
to shut up.  
  
But the rest know the truth...  
  
that no matter how hard  
you tried to fit in,  
  
you just don't belong.  
  
And that's because  
they don't want you to.  
  
I love it, I love it  
  
I don't care  
  
I love it  
  
I don't care  
  
Finished.  
  
I love it, I don't care  
  
Only six women left.  
  
Damn.  
  
Great job, guys.  
Crushed the monolith.  
  
Here's the thing, ladies.  
  
We bought the guys' jackets  
in bulk.  
  
We couldn't justify purchasing  
  
six jackets at full cost  
for the women.  
  
Wouldn't be fair.  
  
But it's fair to not have  
leather jackets for us?  
  
I'll take that one,  
even if it's too big, and...  
  
That's Craig's.  
  
Here, man.  
  
Kevin, this is wrong.  
We're just asking...  
  
Before you go there,  
let me just say:  
  
If you want equality,  
  
you'd realize you're getting it  
by not getting jackets.  
  
What if it were  
the other way around?  
  
Kevin is pretending  
to not understand  
  
there would never  
be an instance in tech  
  
where women would outnumber  
the men.  
  
I'm applying for my promotion  
  
and getting the fuck  
off his team.  
  
This is about my push back over  
the leather jackets?  
  
You're not the only one  
with aspirations here, Fowler.  
  
If you don't tamp down  
your behavior...  
  
What's your game plan here,  
Kevin?  
  
She thinks  
I'm sabotaging her,  
  
but obviously, I'm not.  
  
She's got to learn  
to control herself.  
  
I mean, you see it, right?  
  
Of course you do,  
don't you?  
  
And Kevin, he isn't  
the worst rat in the lab.  
  
But he wants his rewards.  
  
Instead of sugar,  
it's advancement,  
  
and the feeling of being  
powerful in a culture  
  
that not only encourages  
but celebrates subterfuge.  
  
Kevin had no choice but to  
deliberately undermine my score.  
  
To be clear, I'm not  
apologizing for Kevin.  
  
Kevin fucking sucks.  
  
And I know  
what you're thinking.  
  
What happened to sticking it out  
and changing things?  
  
I tried. I really did.  
  
I followed protocol.  
  
I told Anne-Marie in HR  
everything about Alison,  
  
Fran, and Grace,  
the leather jackets,  
  
my lowered score.  
  
And you know  
what she said to me?  
  
She said that by reporting  
every incident of harassment,  
  
I was creating a toxic  
work environment.  
  
Thanks for this.  
  
Sorry, I didn't anticipate  
being here so long.  
  
You were at managing  
your board members.  
  
Yeah. Bill Gurley  
was up my ass.  
  
Then he went behind my back.  
  
- Bill!  
- Arianna.  
  
Ah, so wonderful to see you.  
  
Tell me, how is Amy?  
  
I want to know  
everything.  
  
Are Rex, Gus, and Ava  
still enjoying water polo?  
  
They're well. They're well.  
You do your research.  
  
I have to.  
  
Please sit down.  
  
Thank you.  
  
I know firsthand how insulting  
it is to be mistaken  
  
for a rich wife who got lucky,  
  
instead of an operator,  
you know?  
  
Mm.  
  
Soft-boiled and fruit bowl.  
  
Oh!  
  
You do your research too.  
  
Just a coffee. Black.  
  
Of course.  
  
What say we talk about our brash  
and gifted entrepreneur?  
  
I would say  
that Travis is, uh,  
  
more tenacious and singular  
in his vision  
  
than a young  
T. Boone Pickens.  
  
He is bold  
and uncompromising.  
  
- Uncompromising.  
- Hmm.  
  
Now, I'm glad  
you brought that up.  
  
I'm not so sure  
  
that uncompromising  
is a good thing.  
  
Grit is great.  
I love grit.  
  
But, uh, uncompromising is, uh,  
akin to stubbornness.  
  
And stubbornness is, uh,  
as we both well know,  
  
a liability.  
  
Every asset has a shadow.  
  
It's a matter  
of the wolf you feed.  
  
And our wolf is getting  
pummeled right now.  
  
He's getting beat up  
by the press,  
  
and he's walking into a trap  
in China he can't even see.  
  
Arianna...  
  
Travis needs guidance.  
  
No one can walk  
that path alone.  
  
No, but the problem is,  
  
Travis won't take guidance  
from his peers.  
  
However, you seem to be  
the one exception to that.  
  
It is true that Travis and I  
share a connection  
  
that one rarely finds  
in this world men have built.  
  
So that means you'll help me  
get through to him?  
  
I live my life  
in the service of others.  
  
You do.  
  
That is your north star.  
  
But, and it gives me no pleasure  
in saying this...  
  
Travis is lost.  
  
What do we know  
about the Prodigal Son?  
  
He must sow his oats,  
but he always returns.  
  
God.  
  
I got to tell you, Arianna.  
  
Your, uh...  
  
Your style of conversation,  
  
it's a bit too Confucian  
for my tastes.  
  
Fine, Bill.  
  
I'll shoot straight with you,  
partner.  
  
Is that what you'd like?  
  
You should take  
a step back.  
  
Let Travis be Travis.  
  
Like a father who's taught  
his son how to drive.  
  
If, I mean, once he's won  
his license  
  
and sits behind the wheel  
  
of the lovely car  
you've prepared for him,  
  
all a father can do  
is choose to worry.  
  
Or not.  
  
A father cannot actually  
step on the brakes.  
  
What does any of this  
have to do  
  
with the bullshit  
you pulled, Travis?  
  
Excuse me.  
  
Did he know Steve?  
  
Because if you knew Steve,  
  
you'd know this has everything  
to do with what I did.  
  
When no one wants  
to believe in you,  
  
you make them believe  
by becoming undeniable.  
  
Now, if winning China  
wasn't enough,  
  
I needed something more.  
  
This track makes so much sense.  
  
I mean, if you know Travis.  
  
When you come to the house,  
Gabi, you'll have to see it.  
  
He wore through our carpet down  
to the floorboards  
  
during that whole Mike Ovitz  
lawsuit Scour debacle.  
  
- Oh, really?  
- It was not a debacle.  
  
I was screwed over.  
  
That hole is a testament  
to my tenacity.  
  
If it weren't for that hole,  
there wouldn't be Uber.  
  
As I said,  
this all makes sense.  
  
Even the size  
and the scale of the place,  
  
no surprise to me.  
  
Okay, what else do I need  
to know about your son?  
  
The deep, secret stuff.  
  
Well, you know,  
he's strong and loyal.  
  
Thank you.  
  
You ought to know that  
by now anyway.  
  
Oh and how he hates losing  
so much, he'd rather die.  
  
Yeah.  
  
But winning making him happy?  
That doesn't seem right.  
  
Ah, it gives him  
a few moments of peace  
  
before he starts  
his next battle.  
  
I don't know.  
  
She's talking about herself.  
That's what you're doing.  
  
I'm chill, you know that.  
  
- Come here.  
- Right.  
  
Mm. Wow.  
  
Very impressive.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Want to show her  
what we got her in Korea?  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
- Oh.  
- Got you something.  
  
Oh, thank you.  
  
It's beautiful.  
  
Very unique.  
  
- Can I put it on you?  
- Sure. Sure.  
  
So, did you love your trip  
to South Korea, Gabi?  
  
Eh, I'd never been before,  
so, uh, yeah.  
  
It was important  
to have seen it.  
  
- Mm-hmm.  
- We got wined and dined.  
  
Opened up the market.  
  
You know,  
it was good to get away  
  
from the sniping  
from the press, hmm?  
  
Yeah, Trav,  
that stuff about Uber  
  
putting women and children  
in danger...  
  
you're on that, right?  
  
You're not really  
letting that happen?  
  
No...  
  
Mom, that's just, like,  
middle school stuff.  
  
You know, someone farted,  
and they're blaming me for it.  
  
Except you're not  
in middle school anymore.  
  
You're a grown man, and you  
need to take responsibility  
  
and face your problems head-on.  
  
And, you know,  
  
sometimes it was you  
who farted, wasn't it?  
  
Jesus, Mom.  
  
Honey, I know your heart.  
  
I know you're a good man.  
  
Let the world see  
who Travis Kalanick is.  
  
Please.  
  
Yeah, that's  
just what Arianna said.  
  
You need me?  
  
I'll be right back.  
  
I love it.  
It's so pretty.  
  
The Daches have come to a truce  
and are merging.  
  
They're calling it  
Didi Chuxing.  
  
The CCP's picked their pony,  
TK, and it ain't Uber.  
  
Gurley's going to be crowing  
about this.  
  
We're nearing two bil  
in incentives.  
  
Now we're up against  
a behemoth.  
  
They can bleed us dry.  
  
What's the call?  
  
Stay...  
  
and we blow all their minds  
with what Uber can do.  
  
Our next round of investors  
should be Chinese.  
  
It's the People's  
Republic of China, right?  
  
Well, let's show the CCP  
that the people love Uber.  
  
- Put out feelers.  
- On it.  
  
Hold on.  
One other thing.  
  
Tell Hazel baker  
I'll meet the press.  
  
Let's show these motherfuckers  
  
who the fuck Travis Kalanick  
really is, right?  
  
Hell, yeah.  
  
But who was I?  
  
You know, the press,  
they will write your story  
  
if you let them.  
  
Look at what the press  
did to you, Tim,  
  
in your personal life.  
You wanted privacy,  
  
- and they wanted to force you...  
- Stop right there.  
  
So who am I?  
  
Am I the guy  
that's going to sit back  
  
and let someone else  
write my eulogy?  
  
No.  
  
No, I am not.  
  
And besides,  
eulogies aren't enough for me.  
  
I want to leave behind  
monuments.  
  
Wow. I am one  
classy motherfucker.  
  
- Looks good, Hazel baker.  
- Yeah.  
  
I did my part.  
  
You two ready to step up?  
  
Pictures and bios  
of who will be in attendance.  
  
Memorize it.  
  
You want me to memorize random  
facts about people I don't know?  
  
Everyone's favorite subject  
is themselves.  
  
Charming takes work.  
  
Relax. I got it.  
  
I got it.  
You want to test me?  
  
No. I know that's  
a trick in your bag.  
  
I hope you got more,  
'cause tonight,  
  
you two are  
Siegfried and Roy.  
  
The press is your precious  
white tiger.  
  
You feed it, you pet it,  
and in return,  
  
it may show you  
some affection.  
  
But you never forget that with  
one misstep, you're brain sushi.  
  
No, I'm not joking.  
  
Guys, they'll rip your face off  
if you fuck up.  
  
- Go ahead, Rachel.  
- Travis,  
  
for your opening remarks,  
  
you win the night by not saying  
anything so interesting  
  
that you make the press want  
to dig up dirt on Uber,  
  
but not being so uninteresting  
  
that they write nothing  
about us.  
  
Why is Olivia Lungociu in here?  
  
Wait, what? No, no, no.  
  
Who invited her?  
  
I thought it would be  
a good idea  
  
for you guys  
to make friends.  
  
Fuck no. She is out.  
  
Everything we're doing tonight,  
  
the stemware  
and the fancy restaurant  
  
and the waste  
of my goddamn time.  
  
The point of tonight is to get  
her colleagues on our side.  
  
They write nice things  
about us. She's the asshole.  
  
Okay, fine.  
  
Rachel, make the call.  
  
Jesus, have to do  
everything ourselves?  
  
- That was a great catch.  
- Oh, all right.  
  
They'll be here in a minute,  
so listen up.  
  
Tonight is off the record,  
  
but there are still topics  
to avoid.  
  
The boy who was killed,  
X to the X or Miami,  
  
attacked and murdered drivers,  
friction with the board.  
  
Can we ask them  
why they're such dicks to us?  
  
Adding that to the no-fly list.  
  
Do not talk about  
how unfairly  
  
you feel you've been treated  
by the press,  
  
or women being assaulted.  
  
- Do not talk...  
- We get it.  
  
It's just a Sports Center  
Top Ten.  
  
I'm not done.  
Don't talk about  
  
expansion in China  
or driver treatment,  
  
including complaints,  
wages or health care.  
  
These are very  
emotional subjects.  
  
We understand?  
  
Now, I would like to talk  
about your driver experience,  
  
'cause your company's  
revenue stream  
  
relies on the will  
of your drivers  
  
to the point that you call them  
partners.  
  
Well, that's a figure of spee...  
  
If they don't drive,  
your business stops, Travis.  
  
Yet, you do not prioritize  
  
driver satisfaction  
and retention.  
  
Is that a nice way of saying  
I treat my drivers like shit?  
  
Maybe I should ask you  
about Foxconn.  
  
Excuse me?  
  
Just saying.  
  
Um, we're not your peers  
  
or your employees, Travis.  
  
You know, I'm sitting here  
wondering why you won't grant us  
  
the same respect  
that we are according you  
  
at this very moment.  
  
I'm sorry.  
Okay, driver experience.  
  
So there are some complainers.  
  
But if you look at the data,  
  
my drivers have never  
driven more hours,  
  
made more money,  
or been happier.  
  
My drivers love me.  
And they love Uber.  
  
Let's move on.  
  
I can tell you about  
the Uber driving experience.  
  
Come.  
  
Last you saw me,  
  
I was in the car  
with Travis Kalanick.  
  
And as you could hear,  
it didn't end well.  
  
You need to publish  
this video.  
  
The world needs  
to see it.  
  
He's a rich man.  
He could ruin me.  
  
Your cousin Malik is a lawyer.  
He will help you protect us.  
  
You can't let him  
get away with this.  
  
We all have bad days.  
  
Why should he be penalized  
for that, Z?  
  
He is not your friend, Fawzi.  
  
I want to formally  
introduce myself.  
  
I'm Fawzi Kamel.  
  
And yes, sure,  
  
I should probably  
do as my wife insists.  
  
She's usually right,  
maddening as that fact can be.  
  
And if you tell her I said it,  
  
I'll drop you  
far from the curb  
  
so you get your pant leg  
soaked in a puddle.  
  
But, really, even if I want  
to post the video,  
  
what will it really do?  
  
Cost me my job?  
  
I came to this country  
15 years ago  
  
with a degree  
in civil engineering.  
  
But in the U.S.,  
the degree was no good.  
  
So my uncle got me a job  
at Lenny's Limos.  
  
I worked at night,  
attended school by day.  
  
But it was unsustainable.  
  
Unlike my cousin, the lawyer,  
I had a family.  
  
Driving became my life.  
  
It was okay, and then Uber came  
along and made driving better.  
  
For a time,  
it gave me the opportunity  
  
to work for myself,  
choose my own hours,  
  
take home more pay.  
  
Thank you, sir.  
  
I used to take three times more  
on this exact trip.  
  
But that's the ups and downs  
of the business, right?  
  
I have hope, in shall ah,  
things will get better.  
  
Me and my friends were  
Mr. Kalanick's first drivers.  
  
We helped him build  
this company.  
  
He said we were  
his business partners,  
  
so I doubled down and made an  
investment in our partnership.  
  
I purchased a new luxury vehicle  
with the help of Uber financing  
  
to meet Uber Black standards,  
  
but the stretched incentives  
and the reduced rates,  
  
the payments  
are now impossible.  
  
Mr. Kalanick refuses to help.  
  
Is this how you treat  
a partner?  
  
Well, Mr. Kalanick could sue  
if you release the video,  
  
but he probably won't.  
  
It'll only make him look worse.  
  
Can I still work for Uber  
if I post the video?  
  
You can, but you may not  
have a job much longer.  
  
Why is that?  
  
There's no driver.  
  
Holy shit!  
  
There's no fucking driver.  
  
Came in all the way  
from Primm.  
  
A hundred fifty miles.  
  
But your permit  
was denied.  
  
Safety third.  
  
Dude, you have balls  
of titanium.  
  
We've waited long enough, TK.  
  
There's no way the Google guys  
will think we planned this.  
  
I got other offers  
and turned them down.  
  
Your offer is going  
to be the best.  
  
So I take it.  
  
We doing this?  
  
We sure as fuck are, man.  
  
He's getting rid of drivers.  
  
What are you going to do?  
  
Whatever Mr. Kalanick says,  
I am not a victim.  
  
I don't blame anyone,  
not even him,  
  
for my circumstances.  
  
In fact, I agree with him.  
  
When a man makes a choice,  
  
he must live  
with his consequences.  
  
Fuck him.  
  
So no eulogies?  
  
Yeah, well, I learned  
something about that.  
  
No matter how hard you try,  
  
you cannot stop people  
from writing  
  
whatever they want about you.  
  
Hey, Emil Michael,  
Chief Business Officer.  
  
- Michael Wolff.  
- Yeah, yeah. I read about you.  
  
Media critic.  
  
I'll toast to that.  
  
Welcome. Welcome, everyone.  
  
Just a gentle reminder that this  
is the Vegas of dinner parties.  
  
We are off the record.  
  
But first, please give  
a warm New York welcome  
  
to Uber's CEO,  
Travis Kalanick.  
  
Whoop-whoop! TK!  
  
Thank you. Thank you, Jill.  
  
And thank you  
to Arianna Huffington,  
  
whose invaluable input  
  
has made me  
not just a better CEO,  
  
but legit a better man.  
  
Elbows out.  
  
Ego personified.  
  
Asshole.  
  
These are just  
a few of the ways  
  
I've heard myself  
portrayed in the media.  
  
And you know what?  
  
Fair e-fucking-nough.  
  
I have been so busy  
on my grind,  
  
I haven't taken the time  
to show you  
  
that I'm not a rapacious  
industrialist.  
  
I'm just a man stewarding  
a world-altering vision  
  
that's exceeding  
all expectations.  
  
I mean, not mine,  
but, uh...  
  
Yeah, so that...  
  
That's what tonight is about:  
  
Getting to know each other,  
  
exchanging ideas,  
  
and hopefully making the world  
a better place.  
  
First, let me introduce myself.  
My name is Travis.  
  
I am the founder and CEO  
of Uber.  
  
And contrary to what  
you might have read,  
  
I am not a monster.  
  
Cheers.  
  
Travis.  
  
All right,  
so who's got questions?  
  
Hit me.  
  
Real talk.  
  
You must hate us press guys,  
huh, Travis?  
  
Oh, no, no.  
  
No, that's quite...  
Quite the opposite.  
  
You know, it's so easy  
to get pulled into this  
  
"You stab my back,  
I stab yours."  
  
But really, we should be  
working together.  
  
We're all on the same team,  
  
we're all trying to do  
the same thing.  
  
Help the world  
make lives better.  
  
I mean, that's what I want.  
Is that what you want?  
  
Sure. That's what I want.  
  
Good.  
  
Hey, glad you could make it.  
  
I want you to meet Emil.  
  
He's the Chief Business Officer  
at Uber.  
  
Ben's from BuzzFeed.  
  
Good to meet you.  
  
I didn't know BuzzFeed  
was gracing us  
  
with their presence tonight.  
  
Michael invited me.  
  
Can't let free steak  
go to waste.  
  
Yeah.  
  
My comms girl  
said tonight was for,  
  
you know,  
serious journalists.  
  
Not the first word I think of  
  
when I hear "BuzzFeed."  
  
- No offense.  
- None taken.  
  
Just glad you didn't mention  
lolcats.  
  
To new friends, hmm?  
  
Welcome, Ben from BuzzFeed.  
  
A real journalist in...  
  
listicle clothing.  
  
Tell me the truth, Emil.  
  
What's up with this dinner?  
  
Why the about-face  
on your press policy?  
  
Oh. Got tired of being  
misrepresented.  
  
You feel like you've been  
treated unfairly by us?  
  
You two are cool.  
  
Yeah, but some of your  
colleagues have zero chill.  
  
We wouldn't even be here  
tonight  
  
if it wasn't  
for Olivia Lungociu.  
  
- You know her?  
- Yeah, I know her.  
  
She's tough.  
  
She's not a fan of Uber.  
  
She's trying to kill us, man.  
  
She says women  
shouldn't take Ubers,  
  
that they're safer taking cabs.  
  
What if some poor woman  
reads her article,  
  
takes a cab instead,  
and gets assaulted?  
  
That's not on us.  
That's on her.  
  
Wouldn't that be  
on the cab driver?  
  
You know what I mean, Ben.  
  
What if we gave her a taste  
of her own medicine?  
  
Hmm?  
  
I don't know,  
spend a million dollars on, uh,  
  
hiring a few journalists  
and oppo people to...  
  
To dig into her.  
  
You can't be serious.  
  
Cancer-serious.  
  
I mean, we should do it.  
We can.  
  
Maybe we are.  
  
I don't know.  
  
Oh...  
  
they could dig into her,  
you know, personal life,  
  
or her family's.  
  
Help us fight back  
against her negativity.  
  
To me, the perfect dinner party  
is a séance of the living  
  
to raise the spirits of people  
who are already alive.  
  
Speaking of sweetness.  
  
Look at this pet it bijou  
Travis feted me with.  
  
- It's divine, right?  
- Oh!  
  
Most CEOs don't have  
such a sweet relationship  
  
with their board members.  
  
Is Arianna  
your favorite?  
  
Well, on the record,  
  
I love all  
my board members equally.  
  
Off the record...  
  
if I could have a board  
full of Ariannas...  
  
I would kill  
the rest of them myself.  
  
That's the thing  
about Lungociu.  
  
She plays the saint,  
  
but she's anything but,  
you know.  
  
If people knew...  
  
...what I do about her...  
  
how would that change the way  
  
her reporting is received?  
  
What's that?  
  
She's a slut  
who cheats on her husband.  
  
Whoa, flinging  
that S-word around  
  
like Indiana Jones  
does his whip.  
  
I wouldn't say it  
if it wasn't facts.  
  
So you have dug into her.  
  
What if you were found out?  
  
Wouldn't Uber be the story,  
not Olivia?  
  
Wouldn't be a problem.  
  
Nobody would know it was us.  
  
You just told me.  
  
Hmm.  
  
You got me there.  
  
If you'll excuse me.  
  
I have to hit the head.  
  
You know what happens next.  
  
Let's figure out  
a next possible acquisition  
  
so we can finally  
get over this fucking...  
  
How could you, Emil?  
  
How could I what?  
  
The dinner was off the record.  
  
That's not what  
you should say first.  
  
What you should say first is:  
  
It isn't true.  
  
Oh, that makes it doubly stupid  
that you said it out loud, Emil.  
  
- Jesus Christ.  
- How it works is,  
  
we do the things,  
you fix the things.  
  
Especially when the event in  
question is one that you set up,  
  
you guaranteed.  
  
If we were in the Mafia  
right now,  
  
it wouldn't be Emil  
on the hot seat.  
  
It would be whoever walked us in  
to the room full of button men.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Yeah, so that was  
a calamitous event,  
  
mostly 'cause we were lied to  
by unscrupulous journalists.  
  
But, you know what,  
my resolution this year was,  
  
I wasn't gonna  
get brought down by...  
  
You know what makes me happy?  
  
Doing things that other people  
think were impossible.  
  
And that is what I'm doing.  
  
With China and with driver less,  
I'm doing the impossible.  
  
But then people like Ben Smith,  
  
they just hate seeing  
winners win.  
  
So they tear us down,  
  
makes them feel better  
about their sad little lives.  
  
I mean, Olivia Lungociu,  
  
does she really  
have to write a story  
  
about Uber's data access  
permissions?  
  
Who cares?  
  
Like, it's a non-story, right?  
  
But she did it  
'cause she wants attention.  
  
And she got your attention,  
didn't she?  
  
And then Ben Smith  
got everyone else's.  
  
And that's why I'm sitting here  
in front of you today.  
  
Your utter disdain for privacy,  
that's why you're here today.  
  
Your rapacious need to win  
is why you're here today.  
  
Not because a journalist  
did her job.  
  
Travis, this is all you.  
You must see that.  
  
Please tell me you see that.  
  
Okay, d-defying you.  
  
I see how that was reckless,  
rapacious, like you say,  
  
but that's what it means  
to be a disrupter.  
  
You want to punish me  
for embodying  
  
the spirit  
that built the valley,  
  
that built this building that  
we're sitting in right now?  
  
I don't know, maybe I should,  
  
but I have to be  
who the fuck I am.  
  
'Cause the end of the day,  
that's all I got.  
  
Well, I've got some news  
for you, Mr. Kalanick.  
  
You and Uber are no longer  
the disruptors.  
  
Now you're the establishment,  
you know, so act like it.  
  
And you can start  
by never defying  
  
our privacy policy again.  
  
Hold on, you're...  
  
you're not killing Uber?  
  
I'm here to stop you  
from killing it,  
  
which you seem  
almost determined to do.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Break the rules again,  
we won't bother to call.  
  
So this could have just been  
like a 20-minute dressing down?  
  
We needed to know the extent  
of Uber's subterfuge  
  
before we made our decision.  
  
Oh, so you were fishing.  
  
Have you ever used  
  
your tracking program for means  
other than client safety  
  
or abating fraud?  
  
Of course not.  
  
Like I said,  
I'm not a monster.  
  
Uh, one more thing.  
  
You should know  
you're finished in China.  
  
Apple will be investing  
a billion dollars  
  
into Didi Chuxing  
in the coming months,  
  
and we'll do the same in every  
territory that you are in  
  
if you ever  
step out of line again.  
  
By the way,  
Eddy knew Steve.  
  
I knew him as well  
as anyone could,  
  
and I can tell you this.  
  
Steve would have  
understood you, Travis.  
  
Wouldn't have liked you  
very much, though.  
  
Well,  
a person can work up  
  
A mean, mean thirst  
  
After a hard day  
Of nothing much at all  
  
Summer's passed  
  
It's too late  
To cut the grass  
  
There ain't much  
To rake anyway  
  
In the fall  
  
And sometimes  
I just ain't in the mood  
  
To take my place in back  
  
With the loudmouths  
  
You're like a picture  
On the fridge  
  
That's never stocked  
With food  
  
I used to live at home  
  
Now I stay at the house  
  
And everybody wants  
To be special here  
  
This is Levandowski's  
work laptop, yes?  
  
Barely.  
  
He's only used it once.  
  
I don't see anything.  
  
Hold on, he...  
  
Levandowski installed  
a new operating system.  
  
Let me... Oh, here we go.  
  
He downloaded 9.7 gigs  
off his project servers,  
  
and then erased the computer.  
  
What?  
  
He googled how to scrub  
a laptop.  
  
And we're fucking Google.  
  
You just beat Tim Cook.  
  
The CCP and everyone else,  
  
they're not going to let Uber  
survive in China.  
  
We're done.  
  
I'll take a great big whiskey  
To you anyway  
  
And everybody wants  
To be someone's...  
  
Arianna told me  
about your little breakfast.  
  
That woman talks like she  
writes Internet horoscopes.  
  
Completely manages to obscure  
whatever her real agenda  
  
and design she has on Travis  
and the company.  
  
But that's not why you're here.  
  
This a bourbon talk?  
  
- Fuck.  
- What?  
  
It could be  
for a celebration too.  
  
That what this is?  
  
No.  
  
Google rang me up.  
  
It's not good.  
  
If this is about the fucking  
article, we're dealing with it...  
  
That fire is s'mores  
at a goddamned cookout  
  
- compared to this blazer.  
- Why? What happened?  
  
Your friends over at Google.  
  
What about them?  
  
You've turned them  
into enemies.  
  
They're suing  
over Levandowski.  
  
And not just Uber.  
They're suing you personally.  
  
It might be time to turtle up,  
Travis.  
  
I don't cower.  
  
Well, then,  
it might be time to run.  
  
I recognized the name  
  
Could not stop staring  
At the face  
  
I'd never see again
