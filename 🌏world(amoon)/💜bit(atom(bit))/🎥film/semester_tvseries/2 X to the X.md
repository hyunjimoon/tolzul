Show him that you're vulnerable  
  
and need his money  
and his protection.  
  
- This could be the one, Bill.  
- How do we know this Kalanick  
  
guy is the chosen one?  
  
Something is going  
to pop in this space.  
  
I think you're my new VC.  
  
That's what I think too.  
  
This can go so hard for you.  
  
Buried in fines, lawsuits, jail.  
  
It's the fucking drivers.  
  
  
  
They're defecting.  
  
Gurley. Go to him.  
  
Ask him for another check  
  
to ride us out  
through this fight.  
  
You're wondering whether  
this is the moment  
  
I shoot you or sell  
your company for parts.  
  
- You're gonna come in for more?  
- Grow or die.  
  
A full access card.  
  
You come and go at  
UberCab as you please.  
  
I am legit super pumped  
to be here tonight  
  
and to be part of this company.  
  
Are you sure that you're taking  
care of you and not just him?  
  
This is not our death warrant.  
  
And it's a sign  
that we are scaring  
  
  
  
the taxi and livery industry  
  
and the transportation agency  
  
and the status quo shitless.  
  
Let's fucking go!  
  
Let us ride! Let us ride!  
  
The city has been taken!  
  
Portland, we have a problem.  
  
Good driving.  
  
Thank you.  
  
But you know what, my friend?  
  
Right now, you know  
what you're doing?  
  
You're living a  
Judas Priest song.  
  
You know Judas Priest?  
  
Breaking the law  
Breaking the law.  
  
You know that song?  
  
I'm driving under  
the speed limit.  
  
Nah, it's not about  
the speed limit.  
  
It's the driving part.  
  
Uber is in violation...  
  
Uber is in blatant violation of  
the many several laws, rules,  
  
regs regarding the  
transportation of passengers  
  
in the city of Portland.  
  
That's right, Hasenpfeffer...  
  
I'm with PBOT.  
  
Don't turn to look at the badge,  
  
'cause that's unsafe.  
  
So pull over right over here.  
  
I'm just trying  
to feed my family.  
  
Public safety.  
  
Lack of proper insurance.  
  
Failure to obtain  
required permits.  
  
And we're gonna  
impound your car.  
  
I can't pay these. I  
don't have the money.  
  
Well, that's a you problem.  
  
You as in you.  
  
And U as in Uber.  
  
Take it up with them.  
  
That was easy!  
  
All inside It's so frustrating.  
  
As I drift From town to town.  
  
Feel as though Nobody cares.  
  
If I live or die.  
  
So I might as well Begin to put.  
  
Some action in my life.  
  
Breaking the law

Erich England and  
PBOT are throwing  
  
everything they have at us.  
  
We're getting rolled.  
  
The drivers are panicking.  
  
I mean, we're losing them.  
We're losing Portland.  
  
We need a plan. We  
need a plan now, chief.  
  
Pay the fines, all  
right? No matter how big.  
  
You make the drivers whole.  
  
- You rally them.  
- Yeah, I am,  
  
- and they're not listening.  
- You make them listen.  
  
Without drivers, we  
don't have a company.  
  
Well, they don't give a  
shit about the company.  
  
They're losing their cars.  
It's their whole world.  
  
And there's nothing I can  
tell them to undo that  
  
or make 'em feel  
better about it.  
  
No, you are the exact  
person who can, okay?  
  
You're the most  
convincing person I know.  
  
Get 'em to hold the line,  
  
while I make sure  
  
this never happens again.  
  
Go do it.  
  
I'll do the same.  
  
Let me go over there, Bill,  
  
offer up some of that expertise  
  
we're always talking  
up to our founders.  
  
No. You don't teach a kid  
to sleep through the night  
  
by running into his room every  
time there's a thunderclap  
  
to make him stop crying.  
  
Well, the kid isn't sleeping on  
a mattress made of your money.  
  
You know, I tell folks, I  
bring in my young partners  
  
to keep me honest.  
  
But I'll tell you  
fellas, pick your spots.  
  
At least go over yourself,  
get a look at the guy,  
  
see if you think that  
he's in a balanced place.  
  
Nobody who wills an  
entire sector into being  
  
is in a balanced place.  
  
Ever.  
  
That whole sector is  
at risk right now,  
  
and Kalanick could  
well make it worse.  
  
Bill, you believe  
in this kid so much  
  
you don't even want to check in?  
  
"Believe" is an apt  
choice of words.  
  
You know, I used to, uh...  
  
I used to split founders  
into two groups.  
  
Well, that's not strictly true.  
  
First, when I was  
younger than you,  
  
I used to think they  
were all Jesus Christ  
  
because they...  
  
Well, their followers  
never questioned them.  
  
They did actual,  
provable miracles.  
  
And then I began to see that  
half of them were indeed  
  
on the side of the angels, and  
  
half of them were some  
version of David Koresh.  
  
Well, how do you  
see the split now?  
  
Oh, they're all Koresh.  
  
The trick is to flee the cult  
and get out of the compound  
  
the second before they  
burn it to the ground.  
  
Those Portland fucks.  
It's systemic extortion.  
  
Yeah, they're attacking  
our supply hours.  
  
Using our own app against us.  
  
So how about we use one  
of ours against them?  
  
- Greyball?  
- Yes. Greyball.  
  
Throw that shit at them like  
fucking Kwai Chang Caine.  
  
- What did legal say about it?  
- Fines.  
  
Jail time.  
  
You know, it might  
be a violation  
  
of the Federal Computer  
Fraud and Abuse Act,  
  
which could, theoretically,  
cause the government  
  
to impose such strict oversight  
that Uber collapses into itself  
  
before we even go public.  
  
Well, Jesus Christ,  
they said all that?  
  
Oh, and if Apple finds out,  
  
Eddy Cue disappears us from  
the App Store like Hoffa.  
  
Concrete shoes, huh?  
  
Hey, here's a thought:  
  
Maybe whatever it  
is, we don't do it.  
  
Portland sounds  
like a shit show.  
  
- How did you hear...?  
- We're on it.  
  
Good, because tickets,  
impounds, arrests,  
  
those aren't necessarily  
words that inspire confidence  
  
in our investors.  
  
- So how can I help?  
- You know what, Bill?  
  
You are being so helpful already  
just by being on top of it  
  
and showing up here,  
and I am so grateful.  
  
But you don't have  
to worry about it.  
  
Portland is gonna topple,  
  
and then Seattle,  
and then Chicago.  
  
And then big finish in New York.  
  
If this were the church of  
Uber and that were a sermon,  
  
you would be getting  
hallelujahs and amens.  
  
But I need a little bit more  
detail on the plan, please.  
  
Why? So you can sign off?  
  
That is not how...  
  
You know what, Bill?  
  
How about we go  
over all the details  
  
over boat drinks when we're  
kicking back at X to the X.  
  
You're talking to a guy who  
loves a cold Painkiller.  
  
So why don't you tell me  
more about this X to the X.  
  
- Party.  
- Well, let's not undersell  
  
the guy that loves a  
good cold Painkiller.  
  
This is not just a party.  
It's gonna be like the party  
  
that Prince thought  
he was having in 1999.  
  
And we're throwing  
it for our troops  
  
when we hit 10 billion revenue.  
  
Oh, X to the X. Ten  
to the tenth power.  
  
Like the last company  
party you threw in Miami?  
  
No. This is gonna be  
totally different from that.  
  
This one is gonna be in Vegas.  
  
And much fucking bigger.  
  
The bad press from Miami  
is gonna seem adorable  
  
compared to what'll  
happen now if you do that.  
  
It's one thing to  
be the underdog,  
  
but the favorite can't be  
acting like a scrappy upstart.  
  
You need to comport yourself  
in a manner becoming now.  
  
Like eminent founder-style.  
  
There won't be any  
more allowances  
  
made by the press, fellas.  
  
I know. I know, but look,  
look, look, look, look.  
  
Look at them.  
  
Look at all of these  
super soldiers.  
  
When warriors complete  
a big mission like this,  
  
they need real R and R.  
  
And we are gonna  
give it to them.  
  
We find a way to keep it quiet.  
  
Yeah, we'll figure it out.  
  
Of course, if we get  
blown up in Portland,  
  
and the next city  
and then the next,  
  
none of the rest happens.  
  
So you might want  
to focus on that.  
  
And good luck.  
  
Thanks, Bill.  
  
Level with me, would you?  
  
What's going on here?  
  
We love you, Bill. We really do.  
  
Good. You should.  
  
I'm the one who put you in here.  
  
I'm the one who can  
take you out too.  
  
No one's taking anyone out.  
  
This isn't a fight.  
  
This is love. Now  
TK, he loves you too.  
  
He says it all the time.  
  
And if you want to be one of us,  
  
you know, roll up your sleeves,  
get elbow-deep in pig guts  
  
and help us make the sausage  
  
great.  
  
But we all know your  
value to this place  
  
is not inside a  
pig's intestines.  
  
So let us do it.  
  
And then  
  
you just come back  
for the barbecue.  
  
He's right about the  
level of risk here.  
  
Yeah, it is risky.  
  
It's sort of like Zuck hitting  
send on FaceMash in 2003, right?  
  
He asked for a  
shit-ton of trouble.  
  
Got a fuck-ton.  
  
Do you think it was worth it?  
  
Hey, we're launching Greyball.  
  
Rock and roll.  
  
All right. Jake is on the way.  
  
You do not want to be  
Greyballed, motherfucker.  
  
And let me tell you why.  
  
Because while you  
think you can believe  
  
what you're seeing  
with your eyes,  
  
these technological warlocks  
  
are actually pulling a grey  
shade over your eyeballs.  
  
Thus: Greyball.  
  
That's the geofence.  
  
A digital perimeter.  
  
Good.  
  
Hendricks, can you  
break down the targets?  
  
We crunch everything.  
  
Metadata, data-data, social,  
real estate, credit cards.  
  
Threat matrix built to  
identify transpo hacks, police,  
  
legislators and staffers,  
  
all tagged with a line  
of code in the app.  
  
And the code's hidden, yes?  
  
Only people with access are  
inside this room, understood?  
  
Yup. I understand.  
  
Another one bites the dust Yeah.  
  
There comes Jake.  
  
- Nothing.  
- Total mindfuck  
  
served up special just for you.  
  
Ghost cars available 24/7,  
  
which means real cars: Never.  
  
No.  
  
I didn't cancel the ride.  
  
What?  
  
Uber must be down.  
  
It will fuck you up.  
  
It's like waiting for your man,  
  
wherein your "man"  
means your smack dealer,  
  
and you are jonesing  
like Lou Reed in '67.  
  
Only the dealer's  
already dead and buried  
  
and all shot up with bullets.  
  
He ain't never coming,  
  
no matter how much you're  
sweating and shaking.  
  
Gonna get you too.  
  
Another one bites the dust.  
  
This guy is completely  
clueless, isn't he?  
  
If we've done it right.  
And it ain't just him.  
  
It's like a video game,  
and we have the cheat code.  
  
Nicely fucking done.  
  
Fuck it. I'm going home.  
  
Taxi!  
  
Boom! You just got  
Greyballed, motherfucker!  
  
All right, I want  
you guys to come up  
  
with more shit like this.  
  
Assume it's approved. We  
have the technical advantage.  
  
We're not gonna let any  
limp-dick municipality  
  
get in our way.  
  
Get in the way of what?  
  
Change. Freedom.  
  
We are liberating people.  
  
And making a mint doing it.  
  
Is this... legal?  
  
We got to toughen this kid up.  
  
It's not really illegal  
if the laws are bullshit  
  
in the first place, right?  
  
Like, Bill Gurley calls  
it "regulatory capture."  
  
But what he means is that  
the taxi and limo commission,  
  
they're in bed with  
the taxi owners.  
  
They're more incestuous than  
the clans in Deliverance,  
  
and twice as likely  
to fuck you over too.  
  
Great job, everybody.  
  
All right, everybody!  
  
Listen up!  
  
You want to know what happened  
when Armstrong planted his flag  
  
on the moon?  
  
He flew right back  
down to Earth.  
  
But not us. We  
landed in Portland.  
  
We are staying in Portland.  
  
A couple more cities,  
  
and then it's the Big Apple.  
  
And once we break  
through there...  
  
I've always said it...  
  
Once we take NYC,  
no more stopping us.  
  
That is the gateway to  
the rest of the country  
  
and rest of the fucking world!  
  
And so  
  
so  
  
After New York, I'm  
saying right now,  
  
after New York, we are gonna  
have the biggest blowout  
  
the Valley has ever seen.  
  
Come on.  
  
I'm not a plausible  
deniability kind of guy.  
  
You know me, honey.  
  
But that's what they offered me,  
and in the moment, I took it.  
  
It is not sitting right.  
  
Honey, you can't  
micromanage the operations  
  
of every company you invest in.  
  
And we talked about this before.  
  
That's... that's the  
road to Crazytown.  
  
That's much the same  
thing I said to my guys.  
  
Hmm.  
  
But this isn't micro.  
  
This is not just some company.  
  
This is the one that  
changes the zip code.  
  
The problem is...  
  
It's not the relationship you  
have with your founders, I know.  
  
Phil Jackson and Tex, they  
built a system around MJ and...  
  
And they trusted he'd  
function within that system.  
  
As he became a superstar,  
  
he needed Phil's voice less, but  
  
it was always still there.  
  
He's trying to grow up too fast,  
before he knows the system.  
  
You're not trying to ground him.  
You're trying to help him fly.  
  
Doesn't he see that?  
  
I gotta make him see it.  
  
Hey, Bill.  
  
What'd you need?  
  
Transparency.  
  
I need to know what's  
going on from here on out.  
  
I can ride silent, but I  
cannot be on the outside.  
  
Okay, and why here?  
  
We going somewhere?  
  
Yeah.  
  
Wherever the hell you want.  
  
You see all these jets?  
  
Most of them are owned by CEOs  
and founders just like you.  
  
That one, the Bombardier  
Global Express,  
  
it's owned by Rich Barton.  
  
Guys like Rich, who  
created Expedia, Zillow,  
  
they call their own shots.  
  
But they worked with their VCs,  
  
because VCs have a purpose  
other than just writing a check.  
  
I have a purpose:  
Advising, vision shaping.  
  
I'm here to give you  
wings, not clip 'em.  
  
In exchange, I think I'm  
owed the transparency.  
  
Well, no, Bill,  
  
you're not owed anything  
except a return,  
  
which I will give you.  
  
People get that confused.  
  
And yeah, you're right,  
  
there are a lot of folks  
throughout the Valley  
  
who've done well taking  
care of the people they owe.  
  
And they have nice houses.  
And, yeah, a plane.  
  
But then there are the  
people who told everyone else  
  
to fuck off when the time came.  
  
Now, you really  
want to impress me?  
  
Show me Larry Ellison's  
plane. Or Zuck's.  
  
Or Larry and Sergey's.  
  
You can't. They have too many.  
  
They have their whole  
fucking hangars.  
  
You think Bezos is thinking  
about his VCs at 30,000 feet?  
  
Or Elon? Elon has  
fucking rockets.  
  
Those are not people that  
just killed it with kindness.  
  
Those are kings.  
  
Gods.  
  
You told him about Greyball?  
  
I told him in the  
future I would tell all,  
  
because I'm not a  
hard-hearted man.  
  
How'd he take it?  
  
I don't think I give a shit,  
  
but it seems like you do.  
  
I saw that little chat you had  
with him outside our office.  
  
He put me in this job,  
so I felt an allegiance.  
  
Mm-hmm.  
  
What about now?  
  
I say we keep Bill  
close. For now.  
  
But you keep doing  
what you're doing.  
  
We're killing it.  
  
The Google guys are  
still close with Sequoia  
  
and Kleiner Perkins  
and their angels.  
  
That's lovely for them.  
  
It is.  
  
I'm gonna go to  
the ladies' room.  
  
Who the hell is that?  
  
I have no idea.  
  
But I'm gonna find out.  
  
Dude...  
  
This is Travis Kalanick,  
founder of Uber.  
  
TK, this is...  
  
- Gabi Holzwarth.  
- Your music  
  
just blew my mind.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Are you a fan of Manuel Ponce?  
  
Guilty. Yeah. Huge fan.  
  
I haven't broke out  
his stuff in a while.  
  
Been focusing on the  
classics lately, but Ponce  
  
yeah, really changed me.  
  
It's a shame more people  
don't know about him.  
  
It's a tragedy.  
  
Your secret's safe with me.  
  
So where can I see  
you play again?  
  
The San Francisco Symphony?  
  
Soon. Right now, I play  
first chair every Saturday  
  
at the Palo Alto  
farmers' market.  
  
In the parking lot.  
  
I see.  
  
It's a bit different than this,  
  
but there is something spiritual  
  
about playing for people  
that didn't pay for tickets.  
  
Right, because you're  
just playing for yourself.  
  
- Exactly.  
- Yeah.  
  
There's no expectation.  
No judgment.  
  
No pressure to be perfect.  
  
It's just about connecting.  
  
Mm-hmm.  
  
They're just going  
about their day,  
  
and you get a chance to  
change them, you know?  
  
Yeah, well, I am all about  
changing people's lives.  
  
Angie? Hey.  
  
May I introduce you to Gabi?  
  
Nice to meet you.  
You're very talented.  
  
Your version of  
"Estrellita" was gorgeous.  
  
Thank you. Well, I'd  
better get back to it.  
  
It was so nice meeting you.  
  
And you.  
  
What'd you say to her?  
  
I told her she needed to  
meet the next Jeff Bezos.  
  
Hey.  
  
You coming to bed?  
  
I actually... I have to  
review some more of this data.  
  
I'll be in in a minute.  
  
I close my eyes.  
  
Only for a moment.  
  
And the moment's gone.  
  
All my dreams.  
  
Pass before my eyes.  
  
A curios...  
  
You are going to  
be misunderstood.  
  
And that's okay.  
  
People not comprehending  
your vision  
  
is a sign that nobody has  
gone where you're going.  
  
It's also a sign  
of insanity, but...  
  
Good leaders are right a lot.  
  
These 14 principles of Amazon  
  
are a crucial part  
of my success.  
  
These core values are  
the most important thing  
  
I came up with for the company.  
  
Customer obsession, ownership,  
invent and simplify,  
  
leaders are right, a lot.  
  
Learn and be curious,  
hire and develop the best,  
  
insist on the highest standards,  
  
think big,  
  
bias for action, frugality,  
  
earn trust, dive  
deep, have a backbone.  
  
Oh, and last one,  
the hardest one.  
  
Success and scale bring  
broad responsibility.  
  
Hey.  
  
Thoughts?  
  
It's a look.  
  
And that would be the boys.  
  
Okay, we've got bigge  
issues than Travis' hair.  
  
We knew we'd get through  
  
and have to go after  
the actual giant.  
  
I don't see a way forward  
without taking New York,  
  
and I know you don't either, TK.  
  
- It's time.  
- No. Definitely not.  
  
It's New York fucking City,  
  
and the Taxi and Limo  
Commission is as wired there  
  
as Sinatra was in the '50s.  
  
They roll heavy there.  
  
The mayor loves their votes,  
  
- loves their money.  
- It's not San Francisco.  
  
Bunch of water bottles  
isn't going to work there.  
  
Can Austin handle it?  
  
I mean, maybe we need  
to send in some pro  
  
who can bushwhack the red tape.  
  
Don't serve. No! We have  
plenty of people in that town,  
  
and she can lead them.  
  
Every time we drop Austin  
into a city, she delivers.  
  
She's cracking fucking skulls.  
It's frontier entrepreneurship.  
  
She wrote the playbook.  
Bill, what do you think?  
  
Myself, I'd load  
up on personnel.  
  
But if you have this  
much faith in her...  
  
I do. We wouldn't be winning  
this war without her.  
  
Well, then she's our  
boots on the ground.  
  
Good. Moving on.  
  
How are we going to  
compete with the subway,  
  
buses and yellow cab?  
  
Well  
  
let's start with why.  
  
Assuming we can poach  
the whole cab industry,  
  
that's 700,000 trips a  
day, average $20 a ride,  
  
that's $14 million daily.  
  
But that is not the  
main reason why.  
  
The New York City taxicab  
driver is an indentured servant.  
  
He's forced to work  
his whole shift  
  
for the benefit of some  
guy who owns his car,  
  
or he has to mortgage  
his entire future  
  
to buy some medallion from  
a loan shark taxi bank  
  
that's worse than  
a payday lender.  
  
We just have to wake them  
up to the facts, all right?  
  
If we can message this  
right, the drivers...  
  
And, by the way,  
the passengers...  
  
All of New York City is gonna be  
shouting "Viva la revolution!"  
  
Come on, okay,  
Well, first of all,  
  
De Blasio is gonna  
come after us.  
  
We're outmanned and overmatched.  
  
Do we need to play some fucking  
Enya music for you here?  
  
You need to, like, sail away?  
  
Come on.  
  
- Oh, fuck off.  
- Got to watch.  
  
- You know, it's a valid point.  
- People are gonna be with us.  
  
Ask any hard-core  
New Yorker about it,  
  
they'll tell you taxis suck.  
  
They smell. A lot of  
drivers hide their identity,  
  
pretend their credit  
card machines don't work,  
  
and they have no respect  
for the customer,  
  
especially non-white ones who  
can't even get a damn cab.  
  
It's happened to me.  
  
We are the answer to all this.  
  
We're on the right side  
of history with this.  
  
If we just show them  
the way, they'll see it.  
  
Travis is right.  
  
You're right.  
  
Still, New York's fucking hard.  
  
It's Cosa Nostra.  
  
So we just have to fight with  
that same Mafia mentality.  
  
The Mafia started in Italy  
  
because it stepped in where  
the state was failing.  
  
We will flood the  
streets of New York,  
  
send Ubers where taxis won't go.  
  
We raise prices at peak  
hours when demand is surging  
  
to encourage more drivers  
to take to the streets.  
  
I make the drivers understand  
  
that it's about  
supply and demand.  
  
Dynamic pricing is the  
biggest value proposition  
  
in modern American business.  
  
You know you're on your way up  
  
when they slap a  
target on your back.  
  
This is my city.  
  
Play by my rules,  
or I'll bury you.  
  
I will cap the number of  
Uber drivers on the road  
  
and force you into submission.  
  
You got to get their respect.  
Never back down from a fight.  
  
And sometimes you  
gotta play dirty.  
  
Show everyone the  
long wait times  
  
if De Blasio's cap  
goes into effect.  
  
And then we weaponize  
every rider's hand.  
  
Yes, we ask... no, we offer...  
  
Our riders the chance to raise  
their voices with us, for us.  
  
And they will,  
  
because they need  
what we are selling.  
  
And once they unite behind us  
  
we'll take the city.  
  
You're so warm.  
  
Oh, the ritual.  
  
When I lay down...  
  
Here's to Uber being  
officially in New York City!  
  
Long may we rule!  
  
Hey, thanks for tonight.  
  
Oh, yeah. Any time.  
  
Yeah, next time you're  
drinking with us.  
  
Not on a school night.  
  
Uh, hey, um, I wanted  
to say thank you.  
  
Since I started  
driving for Uber,  
  
I finally, like,  
squirreled away some money  
  
in my kid's college fund.  
  
Aw. Man, you're welcome.  
  
You have a good night.  
  
Get the fuck out of my city!  
  
Hey, what the...?  
  
Fucking Jesus! Fuck you!  
  
God!  
  
- Hi.  
- Hey, you did it!  
  
We did.  
  
- How rough?  
- Oh, um...  
  
- You know.  
- Yeah.  
  
Well, remember, you're nobody  
if you don't make any enemies.  
  
Thank you.  
  
It's nothing.  
  
No, uh  
  
thank you.  
  
The minibar, I...  
  
I know what you did,  
  
and that you were  
thinking about me.  
  
I just didn't know if  
you'd have time to make it  
  
to any meetings and, yeah,  
  
I need my lieutenant  
in tip-top form.  
  
No, I'm good.  
  
And, you know, it  
wasn't just me.  
  
The whole team  
was... they were...  
  
It wasn't the team.  
  
It was you.  
  
Hey, Travis.  
  
- Travis, what's up?  
- Hey, TK, lookin' forward to the big surprise.  
  
TK?  
  
Hey, Travis?  
  
Glad we're under the radar.  
  
Yeah, there's no branding.  
  
No company logos.  
  
I see that.  
  
Where's, uh, Angie?  
  
She's sitting this one out.  
  
Fucking New York.  
  
Ten billion.  
  
Let's go grab that  
drink. You've earned it.  
  
Excuse me.  
  
Well, look who's here.  
  
Kind of like finding a  
rattlesnake in your boot.  
  
Just don't make  
any sudden moves.  
  
I'm sure we'll be fine.  
  
Look at them.  
  
You have an angle?  
  
So far, I can't  
get anyone to talk,  
  
but I'll keep at it.  
  
There's dirt out there,  
and I've brought a shovel.  
  
- I don't even have to...  
- No, no, you don't.  
  
It's all on lock. Security  
measures are in place.  
  
A strict code of conduct  
for Uber employees.  
  
Complete social media blackout,  
wristbands to access events.  
  
Even if they think  
we're partying,  
  
there'll be no proof,  
there's no trace.  
  
Bartender.  
  
Yes sir?  
  
Set us up with a Don Julio 70  
  
and, uh, those folks  
down at the end,  
  
give them a round on me, please.  
  
Classic.  
  
It might buy us some  
goodwill, but not silence.  
  
I'm telling you, you  
don't have to worry, man.  
  
We told everyone  
exactly what to do.  
  
And what not to.  
  
Because you are family  
and we love you,  
  
we have come up with a set of  
rules to limit any career...  
  
Limiting...  
  
Limiting...  
Career-limiting moves.  
  
No CLMs, got it.  
  
Drugs.  
  
Just pot and E?  
  
No drugs.  
  
- In public.  
- That's for sure.  
  
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.  
- No sex with other employees.  
  
- Unless two people...  
- Or more...  
  
Yeah, okay. Agree to it.  
  
Use protection.  
  
No lives should begin  
or end at X to the X.  
  
We're gonna send  
this out by email?  
  
Yeah, we'd better, so it lands.  
  
But you make a good point.  
  
Keep confidential  
things confidential.  
  
- Like this email.  
- Yeah, yeah, like, uh  
  
no rev stats, internal figures.  
  
Yeah, no, nothing with  
the company name or logo.  
  
No shop talk. And  
whatever you do,  
  
do not talk to the  
fucking press, okay?  
  
That's it. Done. Nailed.  
Send it company-wide.  
  
Company-wide?  
  
No, TK, this will leak.  
  
If I put my faith in anything,  
it's got to be in my guys.  
  
All right? Just like they  
put their faith in me.  
  
Now, if I want them to  
stay quiet about something,  
  
they're going to make Silent  
Bob look chatty as Tracy Flick.  
  
Send it. Let's go  
pack for Vegas.  
  
Yeah, I don't think I'll  
be making this trip.  
  
By email?  
  
You don't...  
  
You know what?  
  
Here's to you taking measures,  
  
whether they fall short or not.  
  
And to our fail safe.  
  
Fuck it, I'm not gonna let a  
free gin and tonic stop me.  
  
I'm going in.  
  
Hey, Travis?  
  
Care to comment on what  
this event is all about?  
  
Oh, fuck. It's Whetbaker.  
  
Goddamn. Rachel, Jill...  
  
Why do you have such a  
hard-on for my client?  
  
This is an internal  
company event.  
  
Do they show up and bother you  
  
about your reporting  
at your paper's  
  
Friday all-you-can-eat  
wings night at Chili's?  
  
Whetstone and Hazelbaker.  
  
You hired a comms team.  
  
We did.  
  
All questions go  
through me or Whetstone.  
  
You got nannies  
for your Uberettos.  
  
That's a goddamn  
grown-up move, Travis.  
  
Nothing that happens here is  
gonna get back to the press.  
  
Unless we want it to.  
  
Tonight, Travis isn't speaking.  
  
Instead it's time for a  
lesson from Prof. Kalanick.  
  
Now, there are fuckers out there  
that are gonna say we got lucky.  
  
Is that what you think?  
  
No!  
  
All right, because you  
work your asses off, right?  
  
Yes!  
  
But also check this. You  
did get lucky. We all did.  
  
Because we found each other.  
  
And we get to work at the  
greatest company on earth.  
  
Yes!  
  
A world-changer. A world-mover.  
  
A company that believes  
  
in these core values.  
  
Pretty good, right?  
  
Check these out.  
  
Number one: Always be hustling.  
  
Always be hustling.  
  
At Uber, we put in the  
blood and the sweat  
  
required to get the  
job done at all times.  
  
We work harder, we work  
longer, and we work smarter.  
  
Not just two out of the three.  
We never stop hustling, right?  
  
Number two:  
  
Revolutions are won  
by true believers.  
  
So be an owner, not a renter.  
  
The fully committed,  
zealous Uberetto  
  
owns the work that they  
do each and every day.  
  
Austin.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Austin Geidt.  
  
Now, she...  
  
She is the walking embodiment  
of this core value.  
  
Austin paves a path to  
victory in every city.  
  
Let her hear you!  
  
Now, all these  
values are important.  
  
But for me, there's one that  
rides high above the rest.  
  
Number 12:  
  
Being super pumped.  
  
Being super pumped  
gives us superpowers.  
  
Taking the biggest problems,  
  
turning them into  
amazing opportunities  
  
to do great things.  
  
So are we lucky?  
  
Fuck yes, we are!  
  
Because we get to be  
super pumped 24/7,  
  
three-sixty-motherfucking-five!  
  
Yes!  
  
You know, one day...  
  
One day, we're not just  
gonna be transporting  
  
customers in cars.  
  
We're gonna exist in a place  
  
where bits and  
atoms come together.  
  
I am Uber.  
  
You are Uber.  
  
But we're not just a technology.  
  
We're a technology  
that moves cities  
  
and their citizens.  
  
So I want you to take  
these core values,  
  
but don't just  
take 'em to heart.  
  
I want you to  
fucking inhale them  
  
so they become your oxygen  
  
as we continue to conquer  
  
not just transportation,  
  
but the world!  
  
Whoo!  
  
Yeah!  
  
All right, now, I  
want to introduce you  
  
to our newest investors  
and shareholders.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen...  
  
Jay-Z and Beyoncé!  
  
- Hey.  
- Hey.  
  
I've been thinking about you.  
  
- Yeah, me too.  
- I can hardly hear you.  
  
Is that Beyoncé?  
  
Yes, it is.  
  
Oh, my... okay, um, call  
me when you're back.  
  
All right.  
  
- I'd say that went well.  
- From the feedback I've gotten,  
  
everybody seemed to  
have had a good time.  
  
Okay, let's do it.  
  
Line item: Cleaning fee.  
  
Line item: Fine for  
public drinking.  
  
Tech bros gone wild.  
  
Don't knock it. It's  
gonna buy you a house.  
  
Don't stop Thinking  
about tomorrow.  
  
Gentlemen, just some harmless  
fun we'll get rid of right away.  
  
It'll be better than before.  
  
Line item: Elevator  
cleaning and repair.  
  
How's your night going?  
  
Line item: Fine  
for public nudity.  
  
Guys! Come on! Whoo!  
  
And the medical expenses?  
  
If your life was bad to you.  
  
Just think what  
tomorrow Will do.  
  
Line item: Open bar.  
Line item: Room damage.  
  
Line item: Payoff.  
  
It'll be better than before.  
  
Yesterday's gone  
Yesterday's gone.  
  
Line item: Private detective.  
  
Line item...  
  
"Grand theft auto and  
vehicular damage"?  
  
- Whoo!  
- Yeah!  
  
Slow it down!  
  
Sign the NDA. Just  
sign right there.  
  
Alright, thank you sir.  
  
Twenty-five goddamn...  
  
That is a comma and a  
lot of fucking zeroes.  
  
Yeah, yeah, man, the  
total is $25 million,  
  
but that does include  
all room charges,  
  
and the, uh,  
continental breakfast.  
  
Oh, well, those were really  
good blueberry muffins, so...  
  
Hey, Bill.  
  
Get some sleep?  
  
Travis, you know I  
didn't. Not a wink.  
  
And it wasn't  
because of the music.  
  
- It was all the goddamned music.  
- Yeah.  
  
Well, they're an  
exuberant bunch.  
  
Yeah.  
  
Got to let them off  
the leash sometimes.  
  
You'll be amazed at  
the productivity we see  
  
when we they get back to work.  
  
Did they...  
  
From up there?  
  
I didn't think  
that was possible.  
  
Yeah, but... yeah, yeah.  
  
The launch angle  
times the velocity...  
  
They're engineers.  
  
Yeah.  
  
Yeah.  
  
Hey.  
  
Hey.  
  
I brought you a clean shirt.  
  
I've got to get back and  
get the kids to school.  
  
- Mm.  
- Thank you.  
  
- Would you?  
- Yeah. Move.  
  
How was it?  
  
Oh, uh  
  
kind of like Waco.  
  
Thing is, he pulled it off.  
  
But it was a  
  
you know, more like  
a streak shooter  
  
when he nails a 40-footer  
to win the game.  
  
You're happy for the  
W but, you know...  
  
You might be in  
for a long season.  
  
Might could be that Waco  
turns into Jonestown, yes.  
  
How are you gonna stop that?  
  
Figure out a way to make sure  
  
that the Flavor Aid  
and water never meet.  
  
You changed your hair.  
  
I like it. Yeah.  
  
It's, um... it's more hip.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Are you okay?  
  
Yeah.  
  
Yeah?  
  
I got a call from Angie.  
  
Why didn't you tell me? I mean  
  
what happened?  
  
It just ran its course.  
  
I met somebody new.  
  
I think you'd really  
like her, actually.  
  
Well...  
  
What?  
  
Travis, you can't  
just dispose of people  
  
in your life like that,  
  
especially somebody  
who stood by you.  
  
Mom, it wasn't like that, okay?  
  
I took care of her.  
  
We're still gonna be  
in each other's lives.  
  
We're still gonna  
talk every day.  
  
I did it right.  
  
We were crying in  
each other's arms.  
  
We just both knew  
that it was time to  
  
set out on our own  
separate journeys.  
  
I just can't fucking do  
it anymore, all right?  
  
I want... different.  
  
Different level of commitment?  
  
Different dynamics?  
Different bodies?  
  
Yeah. All of that. Different.  
  
Just... you know, I  
wish I didn't, but...  
  
Look, I'm sorry.  
  
Like I said, I wish it didn't.  
  
You can take your  
time moving out.  
  
I'll stay with Crystal  
for a few days.  
  
Oh, I'm moving out?  
  
- Well, yeah. It's my...  
- No, no, no.  
  
I can't lose the Jam Pad.  
  
It's for work.  
  
It really means  
that much to you?  
  
Yes. It's where I do  
all my best thinking.  
  
Okay, look, how about this?  
  
I'm gonna set you up in  
a new apartment, right?  
  
Anywhere you like. You pick.  
  
And I'll buy you  
out of this place.  
  
Okay.  
  
I guess I was just  
your seed round.  
  
All right. Get home safe.  
  
I will.  
  
You be good.  
  
Of course.  
  
Don't sweet-talk your  
mother and say "Of course."  
  
You do it.  
  
All right.  
  
Love you.  
  
Excuse me. Hi.  
  
Could you just tell me,  
  
what made you choose  
Lyft instead of Uber?  
  
Uh, well, it's so much cheaper,  
  
and the drivers  
are super-friendly.  
  
All right. Got it. Buddy, I was  
thinking of becoming a driver.  
  
What do I need to know?  
  
Here, man. We make more money.  
  
And we get tips.  
  
That's something I never  
got driving for Uber.  
  
Yeah, I'm looking  
at rider bonuses,  
  
driver appreciation parties.  
  
I mean, these motherfuckers,  
they're stealing all my shit.  
  
Oh, we are going to fucking war.  
  
Breaking the law  
Breaking the law.  
  
Breaking the law  
Breaking the law.  
  
Breaking the law  
Breaking the law.  
  
Breaking the law  
Breaking the law.  
  
So much for The golden future.  
  
I can't even start  
  
I've had every Promise broken
