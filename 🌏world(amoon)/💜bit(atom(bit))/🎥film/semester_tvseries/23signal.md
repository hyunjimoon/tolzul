> [Criminal profiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_profiling "Criminal profiling") Park Hae-young ([Lee Je-hoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Je-hoon "Lee Je-hoon")) solves a kidnapping case involving a culprit who apparently disappeared after the crime with a mysterious walkie-talkie he picks up. The success of this case triggers the formation of a long-term cold case team, led by Det. Cha Soo-hyun ([Kim Hye-soo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Hye-soo "Kim Hye-soo")), who has searched for her long-lost mentor, Det. Lee Jae-han ([Cho Jin-woong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Jin-woong "Cho Jin-woong")), over the past 15 years. With the help of Jae-han, the person at the other end of the walkie-talkie, Hae-young solves other cold cases that had remained unsolved for years while also helping Jae-han help solve other cases. Unintended consequences due to the changes in the past follow.
