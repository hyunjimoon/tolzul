Must the physical infra change for the world to make mobility more efficient?  Why?  Seems like $ trillions upfront for questionable return.  Why not pursue a thesis or prioritize innovation that works with the infra we have?

What could be the most important aspects to screen mobility-related startups from VC side?
 
Mathew to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:24 PM)
How do VC funds intersect with policy-making? Do you have staff that analyzes trends (e.g. IRA, CHIPS Act funding) before you invest?
 
Dhiraj Yadav to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:25 PM)

What are the channels for finding investable mobility companies?
 
Jane Chu to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:27 PM)
Speaking of Metropolis, how much emphasis do VCs place on companies' ability to manage public sentiment (e.g. ESG/JEDI) in investment decisions?

@Jessica Robinson given that urban planning, mobility, infrastructure are so reliant on government, urban planners and PPPs, how does your VC fund engage with less agile and publicly accountable agencies to help your startups scale?
Dhiraj Yadav to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:43 PM)
Are these business models considers stochasticity in it? What kind?

John - totally agree to the coalition model - its what we have focused on in building a world class collaboration of engineers operating at risk and managing development

There also is a view of investment in innovation like the mirror of an insurance pool with lots of people paying in so only a few can have their losses covered.
 
Alfredo Mucarsel M to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:49 PM)
How can venture capital be unlocked for intermodal infrastructure projects (safe, clean, and inclusive public transport) in emerging markets?
 
Tiffany Lim to Everyone (Dec 1, 2023, 12:49 PM)
investment theses seems to be core in choosing investments to fund especially with all the involved risks. what's the process like in developing a strong investment thesis and who's involved?
