county level - aggregated (
In your first figure of "Modeling: overview" slide, could you please elaborate on how you choosed the resolution of space (e.g. county or state level)? Also what do you mean by timer control? I am interested in applying hierarchical Bayesian for parameter estimation but these time&space resolution and horizon was challenging.

from total demand perspective (low home scenario's peak is higher) - but we should look at the net

the more ev adoption we have, lower excess non-fossil (can't slow down)

Gretchen - 
Q1. Was your motivation to apply Bayesian approach because you had clear evidence of different prior distribution for each behavior (procrastinating vs non- procrastinating and anxious vs non-anxious)? 
- dead line rush model (procrastination) looking at different (both prior) chunk of behavior (fact that there is proportion user who use this way - may not get this)
Q2. There were little percent difference output (3% and 1%) and i wonder whether you are satisfied with these result and have plans to develop further. I am not sure researchers/audience in EV would be ready to  put in all this additional modeling efforts if there is little difference.
-> separating user scenario itself can be important 
NEVI standard 
timing people charge is not the best time, 
timer control shift (typically - aggregate) (charging profile) - space resolution: available data (survey, ev adoption, google search on ), county level - don't always need to dive deep (based on assumption) - couple of assumption

informed three big EVSE companies and which were not functioning, 

Q2. how did you elicit prior distribution? (did you used data? i.e. empirical bayesian approach)
in terms?  this justifies all the effort that went in.

prior knowledge that you wanted to include for behavior) 30% are procrastinating and 20
