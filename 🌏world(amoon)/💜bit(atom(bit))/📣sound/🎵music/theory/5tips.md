resonate with less is more, 

|Music Composition Principle|Academic Paper Writing Application|Relevance to Entrepreneurship Research|
|---|---|---|
|**Less is More**|Focus on 2-3 core theoretical contributions rather than cramming multiple ideas. Develop each argument thoroughly with rigorous evidence.|Aligns with my orbit approach - concentrate on key probabilistic reasoning mechanisms rather than surveying all entrepreneurial theories|
|**Write Linearly (Tell a Story)**|Structure arguments as interconnected linear progressions where each section builds logically on previous ones, not just isolated blocks of analysis|Mirror my theorize→produce→evaluate flow - each research component should have its own narrative arc that contributes to the larger story|
|**Harmonic Freshness over Predictability**|Establish theoretical consistency within Bayesian/evolutionary frameworks, then introduce surprising insights that feel inevitable in retrospect rather than formulaic|Avoid predictable "entrepreneur as rational actor" cliches - find fresh angles within established probabilistic modeling traditions|
|**Structure as Building Blocks**|Design papers with modular components (theory, empirics, implications) that can stand alone but combine powerfully. Map out argument architecture before writing|Reflects my computational approach - build papers like probabilistic programs with clear functions that compose into coherent wholes|
|**Composition as Empirical Process**|Writing is iterative experimentation, not waiting for perfect insights. Draft, test ideas, revise based on feedback loops with advisors/peers|Mirrors Bayesian updating process central to my research - continuously refine arguments through evidence and peer review cycles|

_Note: These principles particularly resonate with my work bridging theory and practice in entrepreneurship, where clear narrative structure and iterative refinement are essential for communicating complex probabilistic concepts._
