"Eroica Method" most likely refers to ==a method of musical analysis developed by Thomas Posen based on Beethoven's sketches for his Third Symphony, the "Eroica"==. This method, also called [Form-Functional Analysis](https://www.google.com/search?cs=1&sca_esv=52d80f397289fb06&sxsrf=AE3TifMG_bd2cfzwFfAhOjEFfHxseyb_8g%3A1750518003243&q=Form-Functional+Analysis&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwia0qnd44KOAxU3hYkEHT9FDRIQxccNegQIBBAB&mstk=AUtExfDkJdSAtOjTpu24_4wFnz0IVgvCPzJidg7iJJuc09WR38UX8fy0eHkxsK-kNGVIyZdJWkgWz3_vgbcs4ZtRcCpDZuUcj2kg0x23s8hd-8nzS2IQ620QGJqXuWV4xo2NQCR7lbyu9FFa6CZQsMaovMesdinXEpfan4WCenQTQwnG-2I&csui=3), focuses on analyzing the formal structure of the music based on harmonic progressions and functional categories, rather than solely on motivic content or other musical parameters. It aims to provide a clear and objective framework for understanding Beethoven's compositional strategies. 

Here's a more detailed explanation: 

- **Form-Functional Analysis (FFA):**
    
    This method prioritizes the role of local harmonic progressions as a determinant of musical form. It allows for a detailed reconstruction of the harmonies implied in Beethoven's sketches, even when other musical parameters are sparse.
    
- **Key Concepts:**
    
    - **Harmony as a Form-Determining Element:** FFA recognizes that the harmonic structure of a piece plays a crucial role in shaping its overall form.
    - **Functional Categories:** FFA utilizes well-defined formal categories that can be applied at various levels of analysis, providing a structured way to understand the musical structure.
    - **Emphasis on Harmonic Progression:** FFA focuses on the progression of harmonies rather than solely on motivic content or other musical elements, which can be less clearly defined in the sketches.
    
- **Application to Beethoven's Eroica:**
    
    The method has been specifically applied to analyze Beethoven's sketches for the Eroica Symphony, revealing how he uses harmonic progressions to create specific formal functions and achieve particular musical effects.
    
- **Goal:**
    
    The goal of FFA is to provide a systematic and objective way to understand Beethoven's formal and phrase-structural strategies, allowing for a deeper understanding of his compositional process.
    

In essence, the "Eroica Method" is a specific approach to analyzing musical form, particularly useful for understanding the compositional strategies of Beethoven, especially in his Eroica Symphony. It emphasizes the role of harmonic progressions in shaping the form and function of the music
