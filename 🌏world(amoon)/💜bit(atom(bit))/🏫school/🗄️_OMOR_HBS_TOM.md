Hammond established in 1991 (with Frederick H. Abernathy and John Dunlop of Harvard University and David Weil of Boston University) the Harvard Center for Textile and Apparel Research. Funding provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has supported the Center's engagement in a host of research-including a major industry survey, industry workshops, field studies, computer modeling, and statistical analyses-into the competitive dynamics of the retail-apparel-textile channel in the United States and abroad. Specifically targeted by the research are technological innovations in the collection and dissemination of sales data that are transforming the way retailers plan and order merchandise and how these changes, in turn, affect the manner in which apparel and textile suppliers forecast demand, plan production, and manufacture and distribute apparel products.<br><br>Managing the Manufacturer-Retailer Interface Janice H. Hammond is studying the impact of coordination on the performance of manufacturing and retail channels. The focus of her research is on the supply "channel", the set of firms that undertakes the chain of activities that begins with acquisition of raw materials and moves through logistics and manufacturing processes to the sale of the end product to consumers. Hammond is examining (1) the capabilities needed to achieve efficient, effective production and delivery of products, with an emphasis on how the speed and flexibility required to meet changing customer needs are best achieved at both the firm and channel levels, and (2) the types of coordinating mechanisms that can be established-among firms in a channel, among functions within firms, and among members of functional areas-in order to improve firm and channel performance.<br><br>Performance Impact of Continuous Replenishment Systems Janice H. Hammond has conducted (with Ted Clark of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) a survey of U.S. retailers to determine how the implementation of continuous replenishment programs between manufacturers and retailers affects supply channel performance. The survey data and manufacturers' order databases are being statistically analyzed to establish the impact of continuous replenishment systems on retail distribution center inventory and stockout levels and to provide insight into the nature and extent of the learning that takes place following initial implementation of a continuous replenishment program.<br><br>Innovations in Logistics: The Impact of Channel Coordination Roy D. Shapiro (with Janice H. Hammond and Marshall L. Fisher) is studying innovative systems and management approaches that integrate and coordinate material and information flows through the supply chain so as to reduce or eliminate the redundant activities that tend to characterize these channels. His research focuses on companies worldwide in two industries-packaged consumer goods and textiles/apparel-that have successfully integrated suppliers, producers, transporters, warehousers, distributors, and retailers into systems that can be managed as coherent units through which goods flow smoothly. Shapiro's research addresses<br><br>(1) coordinating mechanisms (e.g., continuous product replenishment, made famous by Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart and emulated by dozens of channel partners) that tie different corporate entities into the channel and how the attendant relationships are defined, forged, and managed, and<br><br>(2) information flows among relationship partners (that identify what is critical) and how they are effectively generated, shared, and communicated. |                                  |

| Antonio Moreno        | main focus on retail. His primary aims include exploring operational consequences of innovative business models, addressing fundamental questions in operations strategy, and developing models to help firms make better operational decisions. | In omnichannel retail, retailers provide their customers with a shopping experience that may involve different channels in a way that aims to be seamless. For example, many large retailers today allow customers to reserve products online and pick them up at the store where they are stocked, return products purchased online at physical stores, or buy products online and have them shipped to a store to pick up when convenient. In order to offer these functionalities, retailers need to integrate their channels. This is recognized currently by practitioners as one of the most important changes in retail, one that dramatically affects retailers’ operations – especially existing inventory models. Professor Moreno’s multidisciplinary work in this area – combining approaches from marketing, operations, and information systems – has helped bring such practically relevant issues to the attention of the operations management community.<br><br>In another stream of research, Professor Moreno has sought to understand the operational implications of novel features of (increasingly important) business models based on platforms, such as the fact that services often are provided by independent contractors who make decisions in response to available information and incentives, or the fact that many of these service providers are nonprofessionals. He has also empirically studied fundamental questions in operations strategy, such as how pricing and production flexibility interact. Finally, he has done work in the area of retail and supply chain analytics, developing models that can help firms make better decisions such as improving forecasts or inventory replenishment decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                  |
