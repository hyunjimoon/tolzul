## seven interview process

modeling test (discounted cash flow project model), technical interview - set of instruction for hypohtical project or portolio (1~3hrs, formatting, kwldge of assest class, formulat dsing, financial concepts) + stucured case studey (valuation, project fincae, tax equity/tax credit, pjroejct kwldg, itc vs ptc, industry knolwedg, modeling, math, finance concepts)

greenbridge infrastructure (break into a career in reneuwable engergy finance) - begineer friendly to recuriter process
company in space + job board + 45 interview question https://www.google.com/search?q=greenbridge+infrastrructure+
project ipp

basic model

expected roll back but phase out

lot of deals in the market

tab include cover, provided, inputs, proforma, exercise, debt, valuation
tech agnostic (digital infra are big thing) 

good formating, less about contents but more on formatting (excel)

inputs: general (model start, project life) , capex (construction year, construction cost, dev fee, totla capex), operations (start, end, annual revenue + opex), debt (tneor, sizing start (20225)+ end (2044)), dscr, financing

tab in excel describing (100mwh, cost this much to build, this much energy and sold at this price, )


### proforma

flags (construction flag, operation flag, debt sizing flag)

unlevered proforma: revenue, open, ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)
captex
unlevered (haven't incorporated debt yet) free cash flow

revenue - operating cost 
#### debt sculpting
todo: summarize debt proceeds, principal repayment, interest experrnse to the levered free cash

amortization profile based on the project's cashflow
debt sizing and repayment scheudle
cfads (cash flow available for debt service), dscr (debt service cover ratio) (25m of operation cash flow; lender's own view), dsicount factor - no pta

two buckets of reveneu (constract (agreement at place) + noncontracted)

if not contracted, can raise disagreement to 10c kwh and decrease to 8c

debt sizing flag (19yrs of operation; )


500 cash flow -> lender buffer -> 


repayment of debt + interest 
interest rate = discount factor (7.5%
how much debt we can draw so that is pays both )

build up discount factor (perfivous period and multiply 1 +)

balance increase and decrease over time,  (multiply by construction period) - maximum debt service (cover both principal and interest)

distributed energy is perceived as higher risk = pay sth eles less

redevelopment activity

cahs flow available for bedt service and ; beginning balance, debt draw

free cash flow (total dollars in and out), ; first colum is investment
pulling in our debt, negative cash flow 

LEVERERD FREE CASH FLOW (discount at the cost of equity - )= UNLEVERERD FREE CASH FLOW  + 

biring much lsess captial (34m at first 8m back a year)

valuation: looking at discounted caluation approacnn (- what's the project worth; cost 200m,  value of it is dependent on expected return)

you have a project at 200m; how much debt you'd have if you have (1 and a half more period availabe to pay off -> change from unleve) - 

enterpreise value (add in the debt as well)

cost of equity = 10%  + npv (at 10% at these pv > cost -> )

cahs flow to equity is looking at operation (value i'll gonna receive)
