JetZero's development exemplifies how entrepreneurial knowledge production evolves through distinct phases of understanding, theory development, and strategic implementation. O'Leary's presentation reveals how the company transformed its imaginative understanding of aircraft design possibilities into concrete market solutions through systematic knowledge development cycles.

Starting with imaginative understanding, JetZero recognized new possibilities in blended wing body design by challenging fundamental assumptions about aircraft architecture. Their breakthrough came from reinterpreting existing knowledge about aerodynamics through the lens of first principles, particularly in understanding how geometry rather than complex physics could create efficiency gains. This initial understanding developed through theory development cycles as they converted these insights into testable frameworks around lift distribution, structural design, and manufacturing processes.

The company's working theory emerged through systematic combination of multiple knowledge domains - aerodynamics, materials science, manufacturing processes, and market dynamics. This theoretical framework guided their development approach, particularly in solving the critical challenge of non-cylindrical pressure vessels through carbon composite innovation. The theory development process benefited from reinforcing loops of NASA's decades of research combined with modern manufacturing insights.

Their strategic choices reflect sophisticated implementation of these theoretical frameworks into market-focused decisions. By targeting the mid-market gap and maintaining compatibility with existing airport infrastructure, JetZero translated their technical innovations into practical value propositions. The diffusion of these choices through partnerships with the Air Force, NASA, and commercial stakeholders has created new understanding cycles, particularly around manufacturing scalability and certification pathways.
