page 4 of the document, Fine describes Intel's approach:

"Intel crafted a brilliant 3-DCE strategy that used product/process modularity to reduce significantly the complexity... Throughout the 1990s, the company launched each new microprocessor generation on the 'platform' of an old (line-width) process. Alternately, each new process generation was launched with an 'old' product technology."

So Intel's specific strategy was:

- New product (i486) on proven process (one-micron from i386)
- New process (.8-micron) on proven product (i486)
- Continue alternating: new product (Pentium) on proven process (.8-micron)
