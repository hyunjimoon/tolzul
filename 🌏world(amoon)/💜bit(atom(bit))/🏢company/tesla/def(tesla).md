from [[üìúehrig22_theory_exp]], Tesla's strategy was formulated as a set of premises that logically lead to the conjecture that "Tesla will sell enough electric cars in the midsize segment to be among the five largest players in that segment." The table captures:

1. Elon Musk's original "Secret Masterplan" from 2006
2. The hierarchical structure of Tesla's theory with main premises, sub-premises, and sub-sub-premises
3. The identified weakest premise (battery technology constraints)
4. Two counter-theories that challenge Tesla's assumptions (charging infrastructure and battery weight vs. acceleration)
5. The hidden premises revealed through counter-theory analysis
6. An alternative theory based on a disruptive low-end approach
7. Implications for focused experimentation

This Tesla example demonstrates how the authors' framework allows strategists to articulate their assumptions clearly, identify which premises to test first, learn from objections, and make inferences about otherwise untestable beliefs.
