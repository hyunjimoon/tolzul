from [[üìúehrig22_theory_exp]], Tesla's strategy was formulated as a set of premises that logically lead to the conjecture that "Tesla will sell enough electric cars in the midsize segment to be among the five largest players in that segment." The table captures:

1. Elon Musk's original "Secret Masterplan" from 2006
2. The hierarchical structure of Tesla's theory with main premises, sub-premises, and sub-sub-premises
3. The identified weakest premise (battery technology constraints)
4. Two counter-theories that challenge Tesla's assumptions (charging infrastructure and battery weight vs. acceleration)
5. The hidden premises revealed through counter-theory analysis
6. An alternative theory based on a disruptive low-end approach
7. Implications for focused experimentation

This Tesla example demonstrates how the authors' framework allows strategists to articulate their assumptions clearly, identify which premises to test first, learn from objections, and make inferences about otherwise untestable beliefs.

| **Weakest Premise of Counter-Theory 1**              | **TLAB**: Customers buying the Tesla Roadster consider charging more inconvenient than filling up gas unless there is out-of-home charging infrastructure within 5 miles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Counter-Theory 2: Battery Weight vs Acceleration** | **TM**: Tesla's high-end electric car cannot both have a battery with sufficient charge for 450 km ride AND enable accelerations faster than ICE-powered cars<br>**TMA**: If the weight of a battery for 450 km ride makes Tesla's car heavier than competitors, it cannot accelerate faster<br>**TMB**: A battery with sufficient charge for 450 km ride will make Tesla's car heavier than competitors                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Weakest Premise of Counter-Theory 2**              | **TMA**: The belief that a heavier electric vehicle cannot accelerate faster than ICE-powered cars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Learned Hidden Premises**                          | If Counter-Theory 1 is rejected: Charging can be made convenient even without dense charging infrastructure<br>If Counter-Theory 2 is rejected: Electric vehicles must accelerate faster than ICE-powered cars despite being heavier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Alternative Theory for Tesla**                     | A disruptive "low-end" strategy where Tesla would first produce cheaper electric vehicles for the low-end segment, build scale, achieve cost leadership, and then move upmarket to the midsize segment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Focused Experiment Implications**                  | Tesla should test both battery development (TACA) and the relationship between battery weight and acceleration (TMA)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
