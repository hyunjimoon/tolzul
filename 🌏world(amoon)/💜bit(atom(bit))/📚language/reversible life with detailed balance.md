1. I wish to live a reversible life

1. Words and Body
2. Conspiracy Theory
3. Social Scientific Explanation of Citizens' Participation Democratization Movement and May 18 | The Resentment of Honam Discrimination | History of Resistance | Community and Class Structure
4. Logic of Fear and Anger
5. The Emergence of the Absolute Community
6. What the Young Ones Defended to Death at the Provincial Office

I how to better communicate the concept of death and meaning of life with people with different cultures. Oh and I wish to ask what sentiment you get from the following quote which is my motto:
