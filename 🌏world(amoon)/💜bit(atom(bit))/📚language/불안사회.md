높이 오른 희망에는 깊은 뿌리가 있다. 낙관주의에는 이런 부정성이 없다. 희망은 재앙과 이웃한다. 

사람은 사랑하는 대상만을 알아갈 수 있으며, 그 대상에 대한 인식이 깊어지고 완전해질수록 사랑과 열정은 더욱 강력하고 강건하며 생생해진다. 사랑과 이성은 하나다. 

인공지능에는 타자를 향한 욕망이 없기 때문이다. 

희망은 블로호전적 낙관주의



|Section/Subsection|🔐Research Question|🧱Literature Brick|🔑Key Message|📊Empirical Evidence|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|들어가며 (Introduction)|What is the philosophical nature of hope and how does it function in human life?|• Barack Obama's statement on hope<br>• Relationship between certainty and uncertainty<br>• Contrast between optimism and pessimism|🧍‍♀️Hope is not merely an emotional state but a complex cognitive stance that exists precisely because of uncertainty. Hope emerges when possibilities remain open rather than determined, connecting human agency with future potential.|• Contrast between optimistic and pessimistic worldviews<br>• Examples of hope's functioning in situations of uncertainty<br>• Reference to "Futur" and "Avenir" (two forms of future in philosophy)|
|희망과 행위 (Hope and Action)|How does hope relate to human agency and practical action?|• Walter Benjamin's connection between art and hope<br>• Concept of "Gegenstimmung" (counter-mood)<br>• Distinction between "Grundstimmung" (basic mood) and "bestimmen" (determination)|🧭Hope is fundamentally action-oriented, requiring active participation rather than passive waiting. Hope functions by inspiring movement toward new possibilities while acknowledging current limitations. It operates as a counter-mood that rejects resignation while embracing uncertainty.|• Analysis of hope's role in initiating action despite uncertainty<br>• Examples of hope as resistance to deterministic thinking<br>• Examination of how hope inspires creative problem-solving<br>• Connection between action possibilities and hopeful stance|
|희망과 인식 (Hope and Knowledge)|What is the epistemological dimension of hope and how does it relate to human knowledge?|• Etymology of "Intelligenz" from "inter-legere"<br>• Relationship between existing knowledge and new possibilities<br>• Concept of intelligence as connection-making|🗺️Hope has a distinct cognitive dimension that involves recognizing connections between existing elements to create new possibilities. Hope requires intellectual effort to imagine alternatives and connect previously unrelated concepts. Hope exists in the space between complete certainty and complete uncertainty.|• Analysis of hope's relationship with imagination<br>• Examples of how hope requires both knowledge and openness<br>• Exploration of hope as cognitive framework for seeing new connections<br>• Pascal's insight that "love and reason are one"|
|삶의 형태로서의 희망 (Hope as a Form of Life)|How does hope function as a comprehensive orientation toward life and existence?|• Marcel Proust's reflections on human experience<br>• Religious perspectives on hope<br>• Philosophical views on optimistic nihilism|🌏Hope represents a fundamental stance toward existence rather than merely an emotional response to specific situations. Hope creates meaning by accepting uncertainty while affirming the value of engagement. Hope is not optimism but a creative response to life's fundamental openness.|• Analysis of hope as existential orientation<br>• Examples of hope's role in creating meaning despite uncertainty<br>• Exploration of hope's relationship to human dignity<br>• Distinction between hope and optimistic determinism|



## 한 줄 평
- 재준: 피로사회, 불안사회, 에로스, 불안은 형태가 없고 수동적이고; 
- 현지: 낙관/희망 사랑해야 지능이 높아진다, 
- 민영: 약간의 불안은 자기발전에 도움된다, 동물은 내일이라는 개념이 없다; 서사적 성격을 띄고 있어서 🐿️ - 동물이 주인 기다림
-  안건: 서사가 인간을 상징하는 것 (지적 허영), 아버지로서 렌즈 - 새로운 탄생을 달려나가는게 작동방식이다; 니체 - 그럼에도 불구하고 (희망), 낙관주의 (부정적인 것 외면하고 ) vs 희망 (현실, action하고) - 💭기대 expectation 
- 
- 자영: 의미가 있어야 희망을 할 수 있음. //희망 vs 소비 (희망하는 자는 소비하지 않고, 소비하지 않는 자는 희망하지 않는다)

희망하는 자는 소비하지 않고, 소비하지 않는 자는 희망하지 않는다
-> 소비와 투자는 다름, 희망은 자본주의 용어에 속한는 말이 아니다
consumption (consumer, customer)

- 희망과 불안 (anxiety) 정반대지만 구조적으로 유사 -> action을 촉발, 소망과 두려움 (fear) 구체적인 대상이 있고, abstracted.
