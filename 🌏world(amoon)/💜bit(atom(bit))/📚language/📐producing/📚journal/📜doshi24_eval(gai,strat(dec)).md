Introduction                                                                               | How can generative AI evaluate strategic decisions like choosing a business model?                      | ‚Ä¢ Strategic foresight theories (Csaszar & Laureiro-Mart√≠nez, 2018; Gavetti & Menon, 2016)<br>‚Ä¢ Strategic decisions require predictions about value (Barney, 1986; Porter, 1980)<br>‚Ä¢ Research on human evaluators (Csaszar & Eggers, 2013; Knudsen & Levinthal, 2007) | üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èStrategic decisions are uncertain and often irreversible, making prediction crucial. Generative AI offers a new set of evaluators that may help with strategic decisions but their effectiveness is unclear.                                                      | Fig 1: Overview of AI evaluations to AI evaluators process<br><br>![[Pasted image 20250309090925.png\|100]]                                                    |

Background<br>2.1 Strategic decisions<br>2.2 Human evaluators<br>2.3 Artificial evaluators | What theoretical foundations explain strategic decision-making and the potential role of AI evaluators? | ‚Ä¢ Characteristics of strategic decisions (Eisenhardt & Zbaracki, 1992; Elbanna & Child, 2007)<br>‚Ä¢ Wisdom of crowds literature (Surowiecki, 2005; Condorcet, 1785/1995)<br>‚Ä¢ LLM capabilities research (Chang et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020)                       | üåèStrategic decisions are important, difficult to undo, and involve uncertainty. Aggregating imperfect predictions can improve overall prediction quality through diversity and scale effects, suggesting potential benefits for aggregating AI evaluations.           | Table 2: Overview of LLMs used for evaluation                                                                                                                  |

Study 2: Business Model Competition<br>4.1 Methods<br>4.2 Results                          | Do the findings from Study 1 generalize to real business models from a competition?                     | ‚Ä¢ Business model evaluation literature (Mollick & Nanda, 2016; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2023)<br>‚Ä¢ Business model components research (Markides, 2000; Massa et al., 2017)                                                                                                 | üîëStudy 1 results generally replicate with real business models, confirming that AI evaluations are often inconsistent and biased individually, but aggregated AI evaluations align with human expert judgments.                                                       | Fig 5-6: Analysis of pairwise evaluations showing consistency, bias, agreement with human experts<br>Table 4: Detailed results of agreement with human experts |

This approach allows managers to obtain strategic decision insights with low resource investment. | Summary of key findings across both studies: individual AI evaluations are inconsistent and biased, while aggregated evaluations align with human experts      |
