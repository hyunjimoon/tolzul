The normative-positive dichotomy is a false framework that creates "unsettled confusion" in entrepreneurial decision-making because Resource Rationality is simultaneously both: it prescribes optimal behavior given constraints (normative) while describing actual bounded behavior (positive). The traditional categories wrongly assume normative means "idealized prescriptions" and positive means "descriptive reality," but this breaks down when we recognize that (1) purely normative approaches can be computationally irrational (spending hours optimizing a $5 decision), (2) positive descriptions aren't fixed destiny (entrepreneurs can learn better heuristics), and (3) the real integration principle uses normative standards as aspirational targets constrained by positive implementation limits. STRAP resolves this confusion by operationalizing bounded optimality: minimize uncertainty (normative goal) subject to budget and stakeholder constraints (positive reality), proving the dichotomy dissolves when we treat both as complementary tools rather than competing worldviews.
