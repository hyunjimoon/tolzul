Theory proved are as follows
- there are infinite number of shapes (infinite family argument: systemic process of churning out descendant)  
- continuous >> infinity (diagonal indexing technique)  
- every complete-information game without luck is “solvable.”  
- 1+1 = 2

## **Topology** 

- two shapes are the same if you can turn one into the other by stretching and squeezing, without any ripping or gluing  
- The circle (aka S one) and the infinite line (named R one) are the only manifolds in the first dimension.  
- shape is called a manifold if it has no special points: no end-points, no crossing-points, no edge-points, no branching-points (corresponding open set from manifold to euclidean space)  

## **Analysis**

- analysis deals with infinity and continuum the way jouranlist deal with vowels and consonants  
- abstraction (reduction - the same are the same): get the general concept of flow without committing to any particular flowing substance  
- flowing substance inside a rigid container has a fixed point  
- maps are used to analyze projection, transformation, dynamic changes, geometric curves, physical system states  

## **Algebraic structure** - abstraction of pattern, regularity, relation  
- every symbol is a general placeholder for an infinite cast of possible replacements.  
- form? What makes this structured world, with the partner-things, qualitatively different from a collection of unrelated objects?  
- abstract algebra's big idea is that math is complicated version of basic partner world  
- isomorphic: two structure with the same structure  
- categories of structure—fields, rings, groups, loops, graphs, lattices, orderings, semigroups, groupoids, monoids, magmas, modules, and then a whole bunch that we just lazily call algebras.  
- structure examples: set(simplest structure), graph(set with additional structure), game/predator-prey tree,  
- symmetry types: flip, rotational, transitional, dilational  
    
- **Reduction**; all arithmetic relation could be reduced to axiom system with five statements: 1) zero is  a number 2) if x is a number, the successor of x is a number, 3) zero is not the successor of the number, 4) two numbers with the same successor are the same number 5) if a set S contains zero and S contains the successor of every number in S, then S contains every number  
* Godel proved "every possible model of arithmetic is imcomplete",  "no formal system of proof can prove all mathematical truths"

## math philosophy types:  
- platonism - mathematical objects really exist in some “platonic realm”  
- intuitionism -math is an extension of human intuition and reasoning  
- logicism - math is an extension of logic, which is objective and universal  
- empiricism - math is just like science: it must be tested to be believed  
- formalism - math is a game of symbolic manipulation with no deeper meaning  
- conventionalism - math is the set of agreed-upon truths within the math community  
- We’re not inventing math to fit our world—we’re discovering what math is out there, and then later realizing that our world happens to look exactly like it
