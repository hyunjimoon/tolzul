applied [[Operations Rules_ Delivering Customer Value through Flexible Operations — Prof. David Simchi-Levi - English (auto-generated).txt]] to design flexibility in my operation of mapping solution modules of [[🪢STRAP]] to need modules of [[🧭🗺️selling entrepreneurial choice-map as Bayes.Entrep]]

2-flexibility method:

- Each plant is capable of producing two product families (instead of just one in a dedicated strategy)
- This creates a "long chain" connecting plants and products in a network
- The power comes from the domino effect this creates, allowing resources to be shifted as demand patterns change
- It achieves about 80% of the benefits of full flexibility with significantly less investment
- The design focuses on creating a continuous chain that connects all plants to all products
