Yet existing models remain largely descriptive and ill-suited to guide practitioners facing resource constraints and uncertainty. Current guidance often fails when it ignores the specific context of entrepreneurial ventures, treating all decisions as if they occur in isolation. This research reimagines entrepreneurship as a structured perception-action cycle where the entrepreneur becomes a modeling agent who uses probabilistic programming to predict stakeholder behavior. STRAP provides a framework that adapts to the specific context of each venture while offering principled guidance for action prioritization.<br><br>The entrepreneurial journey inherently involves sequential decision-making under uncertainty, requiring founders to choose which problems to tackle or which stakeholders to engage first. While experienced entrepreneurs develop intuition for these decisions, even successful founders struggle to articulate a systematic methodology that could be transmitted to others or scaled across ventures. By formalizing entrepreneurial decision-making as a mathematical optimization problem, STRAP bridges the gap between entrepreneurial intuition and systematic methodology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |               |
|                     | 1.2 Context: Prioritizing Actions Under Interdependent Stakeholder Uncertainty | Resource-constrained entrepreneurs must carefully sequence their actions to maximize venture success probability. This challenge is amplified when stakeholder outcomes are interdependent: progress with one group can significantly influence others. Historical examples demonstrate how sequence matters:<br><br>The **Segway** personal transporter launched with substantial technological development but failed to engage city regulators and consumers simultaneously, leading to an adoption stall. **Tesla's Roadster** generated enthusiastic customer demand without securing adequate supply-chain partners, creating production bottlenecks and costly delays ($29,000 per vehicle in air freight costs). The battery-swapping venture **Better Place** built infrastructure before ensuring vehicle manufacturer partnerships, ultimately failing despite significant funding.<br><br>These cases underscore that ventures can be undermined by an imbalanced approach where one stakeholder category surges ahead while another lags. Entrepreneurs must determine which hurdle to address first when faced with multiple interdependent stakeholders. This paper addresses that context by providing a formal method to prioritize actions under multi-stakeholder uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |               |

The **Lean Startup** methodology encourages experimentation but treats all experiments equally and lacks a formal mechanism for uncertainty quantification. **Operations management** provides sophisticated tools for resource optimization but rarely specifies which tools to apply in early ventures. **Platform strategy** research addresses multi-sided markets but lacks practical guidance for prioritizing stakeholder acquisition.<br><br>From operations research, the **Theory of Constraints** identifies and elevates primary bottlenecks in a system, while robust optimization models tackle sequencing under uncertainty. However, these approaches typically assume technical tasks with quantifiable durations, not the probabilistic buy-in of external actors. From entrepreneurship literature, frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas and disciplined entrepreneurship offer structural representations of venture elements without providing dynamic decision rules for action sequencing.<br><br>These diverse streams provide promising components—iterative learning, sequencing algorithms, bottleneck focus—yet remain fragmented. There exists a clear opportunity to synthesize these ideas into a cohesive framework that explicitly models multi-stakeholder acceptance and optimizes action prioritization for entrepreneurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |               |

Much advice offers methodologically rigid prescriptions that fail to accommodate venture-specific contingencies: a "single direction" approach exemplified by MIT's Technology Licensing Office's default advocacy for patenting strategies—theoretically optimal for biotech ventures with long development cycles but potentially value-destroying for climate-tech enterprises where open collaboration accelerates market diffusion; a "borrowed map" illustrated by the widespread application of consumer-product development frameworks to medical diagnostics ventures where regulatory approval, not user adoption, constitutes the critical path variable; or "context-blind tips" such as universalized customer-centered development methodologies that systematically privilege demand verification over technical validation in domains where the inverse relationship more accurately reflects developmental constraints.<br><br>The first critical gap in entrepreneurial methodology is the absence of a **unifying objective function** for action prioritization. Entrepreneurs are instructed to "reduce uncertainty" or "gain traction," but these directives remain conceptually ambiguous and methodologically insufficient for comparative decision analysis. Without a formal quantitative objective, entrepreneurs cannot systematically evaluate alternative resource allocations—for instance, whether investing in prototype development generates more venture value than conducting customer interviews. This theoretical limitation forces founders to rely on intuitive heuristics rather than structured optimization processes, introducing significant variation in decision quality and preventing rigorous comparative analysis of action sequences. Empirical observations across 50 ecosystem stakeholders confirm this analytical deficiency: even experienced entrepreneurs struggle to articulate a consistent evaluation framework for comparing potential actions under resource constraints.<br><br>The second critical gap involves **excessive domain specificity** in entrepreneurial frameworks, which limits their generalizability across venture contexts. What functions effectively in one innovation domain demonstrates limited transferability to others, yet current methodological approaches rarely specify their boundary conditions or contextual parameters. Strategic frameworks optimized for software startups (emphasizing rapid A/B testing with minimal resource requirements) prove inapplicable to hardware ventures with substantial capital investments and extended development timelines. Similarly, team-building approaches vary considerably across innovation ecosystems: Silicon Valley's "hire fast, fire fast" paradigm demonstrates limited transferability to contexts that prioritize organizational stability. When macroeconomic conditions shift, previously validated frameworks can rapidly become obsolete—underscoring the need for a generalizable methodology that: (1) defines a robust objective function for entrepreneurial decision optimization, and (2) provides a context-adaptive framework applicable across diverse venture domains while accommodating domain-specific variables.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               |

The entrepreneur formalizes their decision problem as a stochastic model of stakeholder responses, with two key components:<br><br>**Perception Module**: Models stakeholder acceptance probabilities using logistic functions that map venture attributes to the probability of each stakeholder accepting the venture proposition. For analytical tractability, we focus on two critical stakeholders (suppliers and customers) with binary acceptance states (Accept/Reject), yielding four possible venture states: (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1), where the first position represents supplier state and the second represents customer state.<br><br>**Action Module**: Optimizes action selection by identifying the bottleneck stakeholder offering the highest acceptance probability improvement per resource unit. This module incorporates stakeholder interdependence through state transition matrices, allowing actions targeting one stakeholder to affect others.<br><br>STRAP explicitly models both independent and interdependent stakeholder scenarios. In the independent model, actions affect only their target stakeholder. In the interdependent model, actions can affect multiple stakeholders simultaneously, enabling more realistic modeling of complex entrepreneurial ecosystems. The framework defines a clear objective function: choose the next action that maximizes expected stakeholder acceptance improvement per unit cost. By iterating this process—selecting the action with the best cost-normalized benefit and updating the state—STRAP produces a sequence of actions tailored to push the venture efficiently toward full stakeholder acceptance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |               |

For **individual entrepreneurs**, it provides personalized guidance based on their specific venture context, resources, and stakeholder landscape. This improves decision quality and resource efficiency, helping founders avoid wasted effort on low-impact actions.<br><br>For **entrepreneurial support organizations** such as accelerators and incubators, STRAP offers a systematic approach to advising startups. Rather than generic checklists, mentors can use the framework to provide data-backed, context-specific guidance. For example, STRAP might identify that a particular startup should focus on supplier development before scaling user growth if the model indicates a supplier bottleneck.<br><br>At the **ecosystem level**, widespread use of frameworks like STRAP could improve resource allocation and collaboration. If multiple ventures use STRAP, patterns may emerge indicating common bottlenecks (e.g., most clean-tech startups constrained by supplier adoption). This information can guide policymakers and investors to address systemic issues, such as funding shared infrastructure or negotiating with key stakeholder groups.<br><br>Furthermore, STRAP facilitates better **negotiation and alignment** among stakeholders by clarifying each venture's needs. Entrepreneurs can articulate to investors why certain costly actions represent the next logical step given the current state of stakeholder acceptance. In sum, STRAP not only aids individual decision-making but also has the potential to elevate entrepreneurial practice and coordination on a broader scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |               |

Let the set of stakeholders be J={supp,cust}J = \{\text{supp}, \text{cust}\} J={supp,cust}, consisting of one supplier (supp) and one customer (cust). Each stakeholder j∈Jj \in J j∈J can be in one of two states with respect to the venture: Accept (1) or Reject (0). We denote by pj1p_j^1 pj1​ the probability that stakeholder jj j will accept the venture (and pj0=1−pj1p_j^0 = 1 - p_j^1 pj0​=1−pj1​ the rejection probability).<br><br>Each stakeholder's acceptance contributes to venture success; we denote by fj1f_j^1 fj1​ the value (or weight) of stakeholder jj j being in the accept state. The entrepreneur also sets a threshold μj\mu_j μj​ for each stakeholder, representing the minimum acceptance probability deemed necessary for a viable venture. If pj1<μjp_j^1 < \mu_j pj1​<μj​, stakeholder jj j is a bottleneck, constraining the overall chance of success.<br><br>At any point, the venture's overall state is described by the pair (ssupp,scust)(s_{\text{supp}}, s_{\text{cust}}) (ssupp​,scust​), where sj∈{0,1}s_j \in \{0,1\} sj​∈{0,1} is the state of stakeholder jj j.

|                     | **2.3 Modeling Interdependent Stakeholder Uncertainties**                      | A key innovation in STRAP is the explicit modeling of stakeholder interdependence through state transition matrices. Given the current venture state and a chosen action, the next state is governed by the uncertainty in stakeholder responses, modeled probabilistically.<br><br>For any action aa a, we construct a 4×44 \times 4 4×4 state transition matrix T(a)T^{(a)} T(a), where entry Tto,from(a)T^{(a)}_{to,from} Tto,from(a)​ represents the probability of moving from a given state (column) to a new state (row) under action aa a. The four states are ordered as (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) for matrix labeling.<br><br>We distinguish two modeling approaches:<br><br>**Independent Stakeholder Model**: An action affects only the targeted stakeholder. This means many transitions are impossible if they require a non-target stakeholder to change state. For example, a customer-focused action acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​ under independence cannot directly change a supplier's state, making transitions like (0,0) to (1,0) impossible. Each action has a univariate effect on its target stakeholder.<br><br>**Interdependent Stakeholder Model**: Actions can have secondary effects on non-target stakeholders. This reflects real-world dynamics: a successful customer demo might indirectly boost supplier confidence (through demonstrated demand), and supplier improvements might reassure customers (through enhanced product quality). In the transition matrix, previously impossible transitions gain nonzero probability. For example, under acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​ with interdependence, the venture could transition directly from (0,0) to (1,1) with small probability—the customer action was so successful that suppliers also decided to participate due to the momentum.<br><br>These "diagonal transitions," where both states change in one action, are absent in the independent model but present (with modest probability) in the interdependent model. This representation provides a clear analytical tool: by examining where probability mass concentrates in each column, one can identify what outcomes an action might produce from each starting scenario. The interdependence model reveals alternative paths to success that an independent analysis would overlook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |               |

We define a cost-normalized benefit metric for each action a∈Aa \in A a∈A and select the action with the highest score. Formally, the framework recommends:<br><br>a∗=arg⁡max⁡a∈A∑j∈Jwj⋅fj1⋅Δpj1(a)caa^* = \arg\max_{a \in A} \frac{\sum_{j \in J} w_j \cdot f_j^1 \cdot \Delta p_j^1(a)}{c_a}a∗=arga∈Amax​ca​∑j∈J​wj​⋅fj1​⋅Δpj1​(a)​<br><br>where:<br><br>- Δpj1(a)\Delta p_j^1(a) Δpj1​(a) is the expected increase in stakeholder jj j's acceptance probability from action aa a<br>- fj1f_j^1 fj1​ is the value (importance) of stakeholder jj j's acceptance<br>- wjw_j wj​ is an optional weight reflecting stakeholder priority<br>- cac_a ca​ is the cost of action aa a<br><br>In simpler terms, the numerator aggregates the benefit of action aa a across all stakeholders (how much the action increases the chance of getting suppliers and customers on board, weighted by importance), and the denominator is the cost. This ratio represents the return on investment (ROI) for acceptance probability improvement.<br><br>With two stakeholders and equal weights (wsupp=wcust=1w_{\text{supp}} = w_{\text{cust}} = 1 wsupp​=wcust​=1) and values (fsupp1=fcust1=1f_{\text{supp}}^1 = f_{\text{cust}}^1 = 1 fsupp1​=fcust1​=1), this selection rule becomes: choose the action that yields the largest total increase in acceptance probability per dollar spent.<br><br>This rule inherently directs effort toward the current bottleneck stakeholder. The stakeholder with the lowest pj1p_j^1 pj1​ (especially if below threshold μj\mu_j μj​) typically stands to gain the most from a targeted action. However, the formula also accounts for cost—a less expensive action that moderately improves a probability might outrank an expensive action that greatly improves it, if the cost difference is sufficiently large.<br><br>By using this ratio, STRAP ensures that entrepreneurs get the "biggest bang for their buck" in terms of pushing the venture toward success. This simplified rule provides a practical heuristic that our results show to be effective in entrepreneurial scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               |

Identify any stakeholder whose pj1p_j^1 pj1​ is below its threshold μj\mu_j μj​—these are bottlenecks threatening venture viability. In the Tesla case, initial psupp1=0.30p_{\text{supp}}^1 = 0.30 psupp1​=0.30 was far below its threshold (μsupp=0.70\mu_{\text{supp}} = 0.70 μsupp​=0.70), while pcust1=0.70p_{\text{cust}}^1 = 0.70 pcust1​=0.70 exceeded its threshold (μcust=0.40\mu_{\text{cust}} = 0.40 μcust​=0.40), clearly identifying the supplier as the primary bottleneck.<br>2. **Evaluate Actions**: For each available action aa a, project its impact on stakeholders' acceptance probabilities. Calculate the cost-normalized benefit score ∑jwjfj1Δpj1(a)ca\frac{\sum_j w_j f_j^1 \Delta p_j^1(a)}{c_a} ca​∑j​wj​fj1​Δpj1​(a)​ for each action. For Tesla, a customer-focused marketing campaign acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​ (cost: 80,000, expected impact: $\Delta p_{\text{cust}}^1 = 0.20, \Delta p_{\text{supp}}^1 = 0.05 with interdependence) could be compared against a supplier-focused battery testing program asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​ (cost: 120,000, expected impact: $\Delta p_{\text{supp}}^1 = 0.30, \Delta p_{\text{cust}}^1 = 0.05 with interdependence).<br>3. **Select and Execute Action**: Choose the action a∗a^* a∗ with the highest score and implement it. Dedicate the required resources ca∗c_{a^*} ca∗​ to perform the action. This will change the venture's state as stakeholder probabilities update.<br>4. **Update and Iterate**: Reassess all stakeholder acceptance probabilities pj1p_j^1 pj1​ with any new information. If any stakeholder has crossed their threshold μj\mu_j μj​, they are no longer a bottleneck. Repeat the evaluation with updated probabilities and remaining actions until either (a) the venture reaches state (1,1), or (b) resources are exhausted or no action can significantly improve the situation.<br><br>This algorithm embodies a bottleneck-breaking philosophy: always work on the most limiting factor, quantified in terms of acceptance probability shortfall and improvement per cost. STRAP provides a systematic way to break through sequential hurdles, ensuring efficient resource allocation toward the constraints that most severely limit venture progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               |

|                     | 3.1 Acceptance Probability Improvements                                        | We apply the STRAP framework to Tesla's early Roadster development (circa 2006-2008) to demonstrate how it guides action prioritization and improves stakeholder buy-in. Initially, Tesla exhibited asymmetric stakeholder support: customer acceptance was high (pcust1=0.70p_{\text{cust}}^1 = 0.70 pcust1​=0.70), while supplier acceptance was dangerously low (psupp1=0.30p_{\text{supp}}^1 = 0.30 psupp1​=0.30). This reflects the reality that wealthy tech enthusiasts were excited about the Roadster concept, whereas key suppliers like battery manufacturers remained skeptical of Tesla's unproven technology.<br><br>With threshold targets of μcust=0.40\mu_{\text{cust}} = 0.40 μcust​=0.40 (already met) and μsupp=0.70\mu_{\text{supp}} = 0.70 μsupp​=0.70 (not met), the supplier was clearly the bottleneck constraining venture viability. Using STRAP's action selection, the recommended first action was supplier-focused (asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​), aiming to increase supplier acceptance probability.<br><br>Based on our model, executing this action yields a substantial increase in supplier acceptance probability (primary effect Δpsupp1=+0.30\Delta p_{\text{supp}}^1 = +0.30 Δpsupp1​=+0.30, raising it from 0.30 to approximately 0.60). With interdependence, there is also a secondary effect on customers (Δpcust1=+0.05\Delta p_{\text{cust}}^1 = +0.05 Δpcust1​=+0.05), increasing customer acceptance to 0.75.<br><br>Following this, STRAP would recommend a customer-focused action acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​ (such as a performance demonstration). This action primarily boosts customer acceptance (Δpcust1=+0.20\Delta p_{\text{cust}}^1 = +0.20 Δpcust1​=+0.20, taking it from 0.75 to 0.95) with a small secondary benefit for suppliers (Δpsupp1=+0.05\Delta p_{\text{supp}}^1 = +0.05 Δpsupp1​=+0.05, increasing supplier acceptance from 0.60 to 0.65).<br><br>After these two actions (total cost approximately $200,000), the projected outcome shows:<br><br>- Customer acceptance: ~0.95 (very high enthusiasm)<br>- Supplier acceptance: ~0.65 (significantly improved but still shy of the 0.70 target)<br><br>Both stakeholder probabilities have improved substantially: customers from 0.70 to 0.95 (25 percentage points) and suppliers from 0.30 to 0.65 (35 points). The supplier remains the weaker link, but the gap has narrowed dramatically.<br><br>This analysis demonstrates how STRAP balances the stakeholder landscape, preventing the venture from remaining in a lopsided state of high customer interest but inadequate supply chain commitment—a situation that historically created significant challenges for Tesla.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               |

We present four 4×44 \times 4 4×4 transition matrices comparing how customer actions versus supplier actions operate under independent versus interdependent stakeholder models.<br><br>**Customer Action (acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​) with Independent Stakeholders:**<br><br>```<br>           From                   <br>           (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)<br>      ┌─────────────────────────┐<br>To (0,0) │ 0.3    0    X    X    │<br>   (1,0) │  X    0.3   X    X    │<br>   (0,1) │ 0.7    X    1    X    │<br>   (1,1) │  X    0.7   X    1    │<br>      └─────────────────────────┘<br>       P₁    P₂    P₃    P₄<br>```<br><br>This matrix represents a customer-focused action assuming no interdependence. From state (0,0), the action has a 0.7 probability of converting the customer (resulting state (0,1)) and a 0.3 chance of failure (stays in (0,0)); it cannot directly make the supplier accept, so transitions to (1,0) or (1,1) are impossible (X). From state (1,0), there's a 0.7 chance to move to (1,1) and 0.3 chance to stay in (1,0). From state (0,1), the action has no effect since the customer is already accepting. State (1,1) is absorbing (already success). Under independence, acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​ only affects customer state, with no cross-stakeholder influence.<br><br>**Customer Action (acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​) with Interdependent Stakeholders:**<br><br>```<br>           From<br>           (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)<br>      ┌─────────────────────────┐<br>To (0,0) │ 0.3   0.05   X    X    │<br>   (1,0) │ 0.05  0.3    X    X    │<br>   (0,1) │ 0.6   0.05   0.9   X    │<br>   (1,1) │ 0.05  0.6    0.1   1    │<br>      └─────────────────────────┘<br>       P₁    P₂    P₃    P₄<br>```<br><br>This matrix shows the same customer-focused action but under the interdependent model. The primary effect on the customer remains, but we now allow small probabilities (0.05) of "spillover" effects where the supplier's state changes too. For instance, from (0,0), there is a 0.60 chance to go to (0,1) (only customer accepts), a 0.05 chance to go to (1,0) (only supplier accepts), and a 0.05 chance to leap directly to (1,1) (both accept). These off-diagonal probabilities represent interdependence: the customer action could indirectly influence the supplier.<br><br>The key insight is that interdependence enables new transitions that were impossible under independence. There are now non-zero probabilities in places that were previously "X", meaning a single action can potentially move the venture multiple steps ahead—a crucial insight for efficient action sequencing.<br><br>**Supplier Action (asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​) with Independent Stakeholders:**<br><br>```<br>           From<br>           (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)<br>      ┌─────────────────────────┐<br>To (0,0) │ 0.7    X    0    X    │<br>   (1,0) │ 0.3    1    X    X    │<br>   (0,1) │  X     X    0.7   X    │<br>   (1,1) │  X     X    0.3   1    │<br>      └─────────────────────────┘<br>       P₁    P₂    P₃    P₄<br>```<br><br>This matrix depicts a supplier-focused action with independence (no customer effect). From (0,0), asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​ has a 0.30 chance to convert the supplier (moving to state (1,0)) and a 0.70 chance of failure (remaining in (0,0)); it cannot change the customer state. From (0,1), the action has a 0.30 chance to bring in the supplier, achieving (1,1), and 0.70 chance to leave things as (0,1). Under independence, asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​ only affects the supplier state.<br><br>**Supplier Action (asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​) with Interdependent Stakeholders:**<br><br>```<br>           From<br>           (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)<br>      ┌─────────────────────────┐<br>To (0,0) │ 0.65   X    0.05   X    │<br>   (1,0) │ 0.3    0.9   0.05   X    │<br>   (0,1) │ 0.02   X    0.6    X    │<br>   (1,1) │ 0.03   0.1   0.3    1    │<br>      └─────────────────────────┘<br>       P₁    P₂    P₃    P₄<br>```<br><br>This final matrix shows the supplier action under interdependence. The primary effect remains on suppliers (e.g., from (0,0) we see 0.30 chance to (1,0)), but now there are small probabilities for customer state changes. From (0,0), there is a 0.03 probability of jumping directly to (1,1)—the supplier action impresses both stakeholders simultaneously. From (1,0), there's a 0.10 chance that focusing further on supplier aspects could improve customer sentiment (perhaps through improved product quality), enabling the transition (1,0)→(1,1) that was impossible under independence.<br><br>These visualizations demonstrate that the interdependent model introduces additional "diagonal" transitions where both stakeholders might change state in one action. Under independence, it is impossible to go from (0,0) to (1,1) in a single step—requiring sequential progress through intermediate states. Under interdependence, such leaps become possible (though with small probability), revealing potential efficiencies in action sequencing. |               |
|                     | **3.3 Action Sequence Comparison**                                             | To demonstrate STRAP's practical guidance value, we compare two action sequences for Tesla's Roadster:<br><br>**Actual Tesla Approach (Customer-First):**<br><br>1. **Customer-focused action first** – Tesla initially showcased the Roadster's performance and marketed to consumers (acusta_{\text{cust}} acust​). This succeeded in driving very high customer acceptance (pcust1p_{\text{cust}}^1 pcust1​ increased from 0.70 to about 0.90), moving the venture from (0,0) to (0,1)—high market interest but still no supplier commitment.<br>2. **Supplier-focused action second** – Later, facing production issues, Tesla scrambled to improve its supply chain (asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​). This eventually raised supplier acceptance from 0.30 to ~0.60, transitioning from state (0,1) to (1,1).<br>3. **Resulting interim state:** By doing the customer action first, Tesla found itself in the (0,1) state (strong demand, inadequate supply capacity) for a significant period. This imbalance forced Tesla to take expensive measures—notably air freighting battery packs from around the world at approximately **$29,000 per vehicle** in additional costs.<br><br>**STRAP-Guided Approach (Supplier-First):**<br><br>1. **Supplier-focused action first** – STRAP would have identified supplier acceptance as the bottleneck and recommended asuppa_{\text{supp}} asupp​ before anything else. This action would raise supplier acceptance from 0.30 to ~0.60, moving the state from (0,0) to (1,0) (supplier in, customer not yet fully in).<br>2. **Customer-focused action second** – With the supply chain better established, a subsequent marketing campaign would increase customer acceptance from 0.70 to ~0.90, transitioning from (1,0) to (1,1).<br>3. **Resulting interim state:** The venture would progress through a more balanced path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). At no point would it be stuck with one stakeholder fully committed while another completely absent. By addressing the supply chain bottleneck **7 months earlier** (hypothetically), Tesla could have avoided the costly mismatch between demand and supply, potentially **saving $3.8 million** in development and logistical costs.<br><br>This comparison highlights a critical insight: the **order** of actions—not just their presence—can profoundly affect venture performance. Both sequences eventually achieve the same state (1,1) with comparable final probabilities and direct investment (~$200,000). However, the intermediate state (0,1) that Tesla's actual sequence created led to substantial hidden costs and implementation challenges. STRAP's sequence avoided these pitfalls by ensuring operational readiness before scaling demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |               |

This echoes Goldratt's Theory of Constraints, which in manufacturing contexts argues that system throughput is limited by bottleneck stations. In entrepreneurial ventures, the "system" encompasses stakeholders and their buy-in processes; STRAP treats the stakeholder with the lowest acceptance (relative to need) as the constraining factor.<br><br>By quantifying and targeting the bottleneck, STRAP provides operational clarity on which "tool" to deploy first—analogous to deciding which part of a factory to optimize first. In Tesla's case, STRAP highlighted that the supply chain (supplier acceptance) was the limiting factor for delivering products, aligning with what an operations lens would suggest: address supply constraints before stimulating demand.<br><br>This demonstrates how STRAP brings an entrepreneurial operations perspective to venture management. It extends process improvement logic into venture strategy, offering a formal mechanism to apply scaling frameworks (such as those by Fine on rapid scaling and supply chain development) to early-stage decision-making. The framework quantifies when and where to scale effort first, transforming operational insights into actionable entrepreneurial guidance.<br><br>As ventures grow, STRAP helps manage scaling operations by sequentially resolving constraints—similar to managing a production ramp-up, but focused on stakeholder support. This bridges entrepreneurial decision-making with classic operations thinking, providing a systematic methodology for constraint identification and resolution in new ventures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |               |

Their work characterizes how startups face choices between exploration (trying new approaches to learn about viability) and exploitation (scaling known strategies) at different stages. STRAP provides a quantitative mechanism to inform these decisions.<br><br>By monitoring expected acceptance gains from each action, STRAP signals when exploitation yields diminishing returns. If several actions produce minimal improvements in pj1p_j^1 pj1​ per dollar, this suggests the venture might be hitting a ceiling—indicating the need to explore alternative strategies. Conversely, if one action offers an exceptionally high acceptance payoff, it signals an opportunity to exploit—concentrate resources there for maximum impact.<br><br>STRAP's formulation also provides clear stopping rules, addressing the "persevere or pivot" decision in Lean Startup methodology. Because STRAP establishes threshold targets μj\mu_j μj​ and evaluates progress toward them, it can inform entrepreneurs when further actions on the current path have low marginal returns or when a threshold is unlikely to be reached with available actions. If even the best a∗a^* a∗ no longer improves the situation sufficiently to approach (1,1), that serves as a data-driven signal that the current strategy may be untenable and a pivot is warranted.<br><br>By linking actions to stakeholder outcomes, STRAP embeds explore-exploit logic into a step-by-step guide, operationalizing concepts from entrepreneurial strategy research. This integration extends existing theoretical frameworks by providing quantitative metrics that enable objective decision-making in domains traditionally governed by intuition and qualitative judgment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |               |

STRAP extends this perspective through three principles: Abstraction, Duality, and Agency.<br><br>**Abstraction:** Traditional real options analysis requires detailed financial models for each opportunity, often becoming domain-specific. STRAP offers an abstraction by focusing on stakeholder acceptance probabilities as the metric of progress. Gaining stakeholder buy-in can be viewed as exercising an option; for example, achieving supplier commitment "unlocks" the option to scale production. By modeling these generically (binary states and transition probabilities), STRAP abstracts from specific cash flow valuations and instead values options in terms of probability of success. This makes the framework adaptable across industries, providing a high-level representation of venture development.<br><br>**Duality:** While we presented the primal action-selection formulation, there exists an implicit duality in the optimization sense. Each stakeholder's acceptance requirement represents a constraint (needing to reach μj\mu_j μj​), with associated Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). These multipliers correspond to the shadow price of increasing a stakeholder's probability—the implicit value of relaxing that requirement. STRAP's cost-benefit ratio compares the marginal value of an action to its cost, a hallmark of real options thinking: invest in an option if its expected value exceeds cost. This duality provides insights into scaling readiness, serving as a quantitative "go/no-go" gauge for major venture transitions.<br><br>**Agency:** Perhaps most significantly, STRAP extends classical real options theory by incorporating entrepreneurial agency. Traditional real options assume the decision-maker passively observes external uncertainty resolution (e.g., market growth). In entrepreneurial settings, founders actively create and shape options through deliberate action. STRAP explicitly models this active role: each action represents an option that the entrepreneur exercises to drive state changes. By quantifying how actions change probabilities, STRAP injects agency into real options—uncertainty isn't merely exogenous but can be systematically reduced through targeted interventions.<br><br>STRAP thus complements real options theory by providing an action-oriented, probabilistic state model of venture development. It retains the flexibility and rigor of real options analysis while adapting it to entrepreneurial contexts where abstracted probabilities, optimization duality, and agent-driven uncertainty reduction are paramount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               |

An intriguing extension would incorporate uncertainty reduction in a more informational sense, using entropy or similar measures to capture unknown unknowns.<br><br>It is crucial to distinguish between reducing uncertainty and improving outcomes: decreasing uncertainty implies higher fidelity of knowledge, not necessarily higher acceptance. A "clean reject" by a stakeholder provides clarity (lowers uncertainty) even though it represents a negative outcome. If a supplier definitively says "no" after a trial, the entropy in our belief about that supplier drops—we know where we stand—but the venture's success probability decreases rather than improves.<br><br>In future work, one could incorporate an entropy term or information value calculation into action selection to capture the benefit of learning. The challenge is to avoid conflating quality of information with favorability of outcome. A two-objective approach might evaluate actions on a combined metric of probability improvement and entropy reduction (information gain). This would occasionally favor actions that primarily yield learning (e.g., a small-scale experiment) if that knowledge could significantly redirect strategy.<br><br>Extending STRAP with an entropy-based component would enable handling "unknown unknowns"—factors the model isn't aware of—by rewarding exploratory actions that clarify the entrepreneurial landscape, even if they don't immediately improve acceptance probabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |               |

Real ventures often involve multiple stakeholders with complex interdependencies—effectively a network of influence. For example, positive signals from early customers might boost supplier confidence, attract investors, and influence regulators, creating cascading effects throughout the stakeholder ecosystem.<br><br>Future work could develop a sophisticated network model of stakeholder relationships, using influence graphs or Bayesian networks where nodes represent stakeholder states and directed edges capture influence strength. Actions would then have multi-step ripple effects through this network.<br><br>Moreover, interdependence might be time-varying or context-dependent—customer enthusiasm might strongly affect suppliers after a certain threshold of demand, but not before. Capturing such dynamics would improve model fidelity.<br><br>Another frontier involves using causal discovery techniques to learn interdependency structures from data on past ventures. Analysis of how different stakeholder metrics evolved over time in response to actions could reveal which stakeholders tend to move together or influence each other, uncovering "hidden interdependencies" that entrepreneurs typically overlook.<br><br>An enhanced STRAP model could then advise actions in a multi-stakeholder environment (suppliers, customers, regulators, investors) and predict how an action targeting one group might cascade through others. While computational complexity increases with more stakeholders, probabilistic programming and modern Bayesian inference methods offer promising approaches to manage this complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |               |

A corresponding dual formulation was beyond our main exposition but holds significant value for scaling diagnostics.<br><br>In the dual perspective, Lagrange multipliers associated with each stakeholder's threshold μj\mu_j μj​ would indicate the "price" of tightening or relaxing those requirements. Economically interpreted, a high multiplier for stakeholder jj j means that jj j's acceptance is the critical limiting factor—the venture would "pay a lot" (in objective trade-off terms) for a small improvement in that area.<br><br>Monitoring these dual variables over time can inform when a venture is ready to scale. If the multiplier for the customer constraint drops to near zero, customer acceptance is no longer the binding constraint—market uncertainty is resolved, and scaling sales becomes an execution challenge. If all stakeholder constraints have low multipliers, the venture could be considered "validated" on all fronts and ripe for aggressive scaling (e.g., full production, expanded marketing).<br><br>Conversely, if a multiplier remains high for one stakeholder, more work is needed before scaling. This dual perspective provides a quantitative "go/no-go" gauge for scaling decisions, complementing the stepwise action recommendations of the primal model.<br><br>The dual could also help diagnose diminishing returns: if increasing one stakeholder's probability slightly costs disproportionately more (reflected in the dual), the strategy should perhaps shift to another area or innovate on a different dimension. Implementing and testing this dual formulation on historical venture data could validate its usefulness as a "scale readiness diagnostic" tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |               |

Accelerators, investors, or policymakers overseeing venture portfolios could use STRAP-like modeling to improve ecosystem outcomes.<br><br>For instance, an accelerator could implement STRAP for each startup in a cohort, then aggregate insights to identify common bottlenecks: perhaps 60% of startups face supplier acceptance challenges while customer interest is generally high. Recognizing such patterns could lead the accelerator to organize supplier fairs or negotiate bulk deals on behalf of the cohort—a coordinated action benefiting many ventures simultaneously.<br><br>From an investment allocation perspective, if a funding agency identifies through STRAP analyses that regulatory approval steps represent the dominant bottleneck across biotech startups, they might allocate grant money specifically to help ventures clear that hurdle (subsidizing clinical trials or regulatory consulting).<br><br>Ecosystem health metrics derived from STRAP could provide valuable insights: the distribution of ventures across states (how many are stuck in (0,1) vs. (1,0) vs. reaching (1,1)) could indicate ecosystem balance. If a region has many (0,1) ventures (high demand, weak supply chains), interventions on the supply side (infrastructure investment or supply chain incubators) would be warranted. Conversely, many (1,0) ventures (great technology, no market) would suggest focusing on marketing, customer discovery, or market education efforts.<br><br>By scaling up the STRAP approach, ecosystem stakeholders like government agencies or industry groups can make policy decisions and design coordinated actions (consortiums, shared testing facilities, etc.) that address systemic bottlenecks. This would improve resource allocation efficiency across the innovation ecosystem, potentially accelerating venture success rates on a broader scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |               |

Conclusion**   |                                                                                | This research introduces STRAP (Strategic Threshold Resolution for Actionable Priorities) as a probabilistic framework for entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty. By modeling stakeholder acceptance probabilities and their interdependencies, STRAP transforms the fundamental entrepreneurial challenge of action prioritization from an intuitive art into a systematic science.<br><br>The framework's key contributions include:<br><br>1. A **unified objective function** that focuses on stakeholder acceptance probability improvement per resource unit, providing a clear metric for action prioritization<br>2. A **dual stakeholder model** that explicitly represents supplier and customer interdependence through state transition matrices, revealing non-obvious pathways to venture success<br>3. A **bottleneck-breaking algorithm** that iteratively identifies and addresses critical constraints, ensuring efficient resource allocation<br>4. A **rigorous case application** demonstrating how Tesla could have saved approximately $3.8 million through supplier-first sequencing rather than customer-first approaches<br><br>These contributions advance entrepreneurship theory by formalizing the relationship between stakeholder management and venture performance. They also provide practical tools for entrepreneurs to systematically navigate the complex landscape of multi-stakeholder decision-making under resource constraints.<br><br>The STRAP framework offers significant implications for entrepreneurial practice, support organizations, and ecosystem development. By transforming entrepreneurial intuition into a structured methodology, it enables more effective resource allocation, personalized venture guidance, and ecosystem-level coordination. Future development of STRAP—incorporating entropy-based uncertainty measures, enhanced interdependence modeling, dual formulations for scaling diagnostics, and ecosystem applications—promises to further expand its theoretical and practical impact.<br><br>STRAP represents a fundamental advancement in how we conceptualize and approach entrepreneurial decision-making, providing a rigorous yet accessible methodology for transforming unpredictable ventures into successful outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |               |
