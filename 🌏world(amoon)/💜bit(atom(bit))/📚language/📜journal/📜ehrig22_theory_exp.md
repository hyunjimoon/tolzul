**Key Overall Findings:**

1. Theories organize strategists' beliefs about necessary and sufficient conditions for envisioned futures
2. Strategists should test weakest premises first through focused experimentation
3. Counter-theories reveal hidden premises even when objections are rejected
4. This framework allows systematic inference about untestable assumptions
5. Theory-based learning complements statistical approaches by providing meaningful priors

**Practical Implications:**

1. Articulate theories by identifying premises for conjectures about strategic success
2. Order premises by belief strength and focus experiments on weakest premises
3. Actively seek counter-theories to identify hidden premises
4. Use the logic of theories to make inferences between testable and untestable assumptions
5. Maintain theoretical focus while systematically seeking reasons to be wrong
