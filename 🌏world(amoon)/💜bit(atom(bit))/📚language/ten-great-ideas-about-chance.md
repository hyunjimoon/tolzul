\- How chance is solidified as probability and applied to mathematics, statistics, economics, and finance to physics and computer science

\- Starting from Cardano and Ramsey who thought chance and judgement could be measured it extends to how frequency is related to chance, and how chance, judgment, and frequency could be unified. Bayes laid the foundation of modern statistics, Hume explored the problem of induction, Kolmogorov laid general mathematical framework for probability. Application of computability to chance, why chance is essential to modern physics, and lastly we are psychologically predisposed to error when judging chance (Kahneman, Tversky) are introduced.
