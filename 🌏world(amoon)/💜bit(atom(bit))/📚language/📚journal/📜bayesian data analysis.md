"de Finetti’s theorem, to which we alluded in Section 1.2, states that in the limit as J → ∞, any suitably well-behaved exchangeable distribution on (θ 1 , . . . , θ J ) can be expressed as a mixture of independent and identical distributions as in (5.2). The theorem does not hold when J is ﬁnite (see Exercises 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4)."

1. Exchangeability with known model parameters: For each of the following three examples, answer: (i) Are observations y 1 and y 2 exchangeable? (ii) Are observations y 1 and y2  independent? (iii) Can we act as if the two observations are independent?

(a) A box has one black ball and one white ball. We pick a ball y 1 at random, put it back, and pick another ball y 2 at random.

(b) A box has one black ball and one white ball. We pick a ball y 1 at random, we do not put it back, then we pick ball y 2 .

(c) A box has a million black balls and a million white balls. We pick a ball y 1 at random, we do not put it back, then we pick ball y 2 at random.


2. Exchangeability with known model parameters: For each of the following three examples, answer: (i) Are observations y 1 and y 2 exchangeable? (ii) Are observations y 1 and y2  independent? (iii) Can we act as if the two observations are independent?

(a) A box has n black and white balls but we do not know how many of each color. We pick a ball y 1 at random, put it back, and pick another ball y 2 at random.

(b) A box has n black and white balls but we do not know how many of each color. We pick a ball y 1 at random, we do not put it back, then we pick ball y 2 at random.

(c) Same as (b) but we know that there are many balls of each color in the box.


4. Exchangeable prior distributions: suppose it is known a priori that the 2J parameters θ 1 , . . . , θ 2J are clustered into two groups, with exactly half being drawn from a N(1, 1) distribution, and the other half being drawn from a N(−1, 1) distribution, but we have not observed which parameters come from which distribution.

(a) Are θ 1 , . . . , θ 2J exchangeable under this prior distribution?

(b) Show that this distribution cannot be written as a mixture of independent and identically distributed components.

(c) Why can we not simply take the limit as J → ∞ and get a counterexample to de Finetti’s theorem?
