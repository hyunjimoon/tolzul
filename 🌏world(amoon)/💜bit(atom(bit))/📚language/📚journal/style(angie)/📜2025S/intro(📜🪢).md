| **1**         | **üñºÔ∏è Context**                      | ‚Ä¢ Early-stage ventures often face a critical **sequencing dilemma**: whether to secure supply-side resources (technology, capacity, partners) before demand materializes, or vice versa.<br>‚Ä¢ Entrepreneurs operate under severe resource constraints and extreme uncertainty, making the prioritization of stakeholder-focused actions inherently challenging.<br>‚Ä¢ Missteps in this sequencing can be **fatal**.                                                                                                |
| **2**         | **üí≠ Gap Analysis**                  | We analyze the problem's cause as threefold.<br>‚Ä¢ **First**, entrepreneurs need to persuade customers and resource partners who have **stochastic and interdependent utility**.<br>‚Ä¢ **Second**, given this complexity, entrepreneurs can't evaluate which stakeholder to prioritize for **inter-acting with stakeholders**.<br>‚Ä¢ **Third**, even with effectiveness metrics for actions, entrepreneurs lack **operational rules to optimize** their stakeholder engagement strategy.                             |
| **3**         | **üìê Approach Setup**                | ‚Ä¢ We address this gap by developing a decision-analytic framework for **entrepreneurial action sequencing**.<br>‚Ä¢ In this paper, we introduce the **STRAP model** (Strategic Threshold-Based Action Prioritization), which treats stakeholder acceptance as measurable state variables rather than subjective beliefs.<br>‚Ä¢ This approach enables empirical tractability and online optimization for effective stakeholder collaboration.                                                                         |
| **4**         | **üìê Approach Formulation**          | ‚Ä¢ Building on this modeling setup, we formulate the entrepreneur's decision as an optimization problem with measurable constructs.<br>‚Ä¢ The decision problem is to choose which stakeholder to engage first to maximize the venture's expected value.<br>‚Ä¢ We deliberately ground the model in a single-period context for clarity, focusing on the **initial action choice** and its immediate impact on venture trajectory.                                                                                     |
| **5**         | **üìú Lit Review - Bayesian**         | ‚Ä¢ Our approach builds upon and extends emerging research on **Bayesian entrepreneurship**.<br>‚Ä¢ Recent studies stress the importance of systematic experimentation, iterative learning, and adaptation in new ventures.<br>‚Ä¢ However, whereas much of the prior work examines single-dimension learning, our framework extends to **multi-dimensional learning** across different stakeholder groups.                                                                                                             |
| **6**         | **üìú Lit Review - Operations**       | ‚Ä¢ We also contribute to the nascent intersection of entrepreneurship and **operations management**.<br>‚Ä¢ Traditional operations management offers inventory control, supply chain optimization, and capacity planning tools that typically assume known probability distributions.<br>‚Ä¢ Our work imports inventory-theoretic logic into entrepreneurial problems, applying operations management principles to stakeholder sequencing decisions.                                                                  |
| **7**         | **üìú Lit Review - Entrepreneurship** | ‚Ä¢ Furthermore, the STRAP framework connects to foundational theories in entrepreneurship, particularly **effectuation** and **stakeholder theory**.<br>‚Ä¢ Effectuation theory argues that successful entrepreneurs excel by engaging stakeholders to co-create the venture under "affordable loss" logic.<br>‚Ä¢ Our model provides a quantitative complement to effectuation by calculating which stakeholder sequence minimizes potential downsides.                                                               |
| **8**         | **üí∏ Integrative Summary**           | ‚Ä¢ In summary, this paper offers a novel **integrative and quantitative framework** that advances entrepreneurial decision-making beyond existing approaches.<br>‚Ä¢ Unlike prior work that treats stakeholder engagement qualitatively, STRAP provides a **unified mathematical framework** that captures stakeholder dynamics, uncertainty, and strategic interdependence.<br>‚Ä¢ This integration enables **systematic quantification** of entrepreneurial trade-offs previously addressed only through heuristics. |
| **9**         | **üí∏ First Contribution**            | ‚Ä¢ **First**, we model stakeholder acceptance as measurable state variables rather than subjective beliefs, bringing theoretical models closer to empirics.<br>‚Ä¢ This approach solves entrepreneurs' systematic evaluation problem by providing concrete metrics to track progress with different stakeholder groups.<br>‚Ä¢ The measurable construct enables online optimization for effective collaboration and shared observational foundations for stakeholder engagement.                                       |
| **10**        | **üí∏ Second Contribution**           | ‚Ä¢ **Second**, we derive inventory-based operational rules that systematically balance risks of early versus late stakeholder commitment.<br>‚Ä¢ Our decision-theoretic policies use inventory optimization to prescribe which stakeholder entrepreneurs should engage first given their cost structure and uncertainty environment.<br>‚Ä¢ This contribution directly addresses entrepreneurs' lack of operational optimization rules by providing quantitative decision criteria.                                    |
| **11**        | **üí∏ Third Contribution**            | ‚Ä¢ **Third**, we demonstrate how operations management principles can advance Bayesian entrepreneurship theory beyond existing approaches.<br>‚Ä¢ By combining measurable state variables with operational rules, we provide novel extensions that enhance systematic experimentation and learning frameworks.<br>‚Ä¢ This theoretical advancement offers specific managerial implications for how entrepreneurs and institutions can systematically evaluate and optimize entrepreneurial actions.                    |
| **12**        | **üìù Outline**                       | ‚Ä¢ The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.<br>‚Ä¢ **Section 2** develops our framework in two parts: Section 2.1 establishes stakeholder acceptance as measurable state variables, while Section 2.2 derives operations rules revealing **probability paradox and Œ≥-flipping effects**.<br>‚Ä¢ **Section 3** validates our approach through three case applications, **Section 4** discusses implications and limitations, and **Section 5** concludes with contributions to theory and practice.          |
