# **Abstract**
_We present STRAP (Strategic Threshold-based Action Prioritization), a decision-theoretic framework for sequencing entrepreneurial actions under uncertainty._ STRAP models the venture as a state transition system with stakeholder acceptance probabilities as state variables. By evaluating each action’s impact on stakeholder “buy-in,” STRAP identifies bottlenecks and recommends a sequence that maximizes the venture’s overall probability of success under resource constraints. Using case studies (Tesla’s Roadster, Segway, Better Place), we demonstrate that the **order** of actions—beyond their individual merits—can significantly influence outcomes. STRAP’s quantitative approach integrates theories of iterative learning, bottleneck management, and sequential optimization to guide entrepreneurs in allocating effort where it yields the highest leverage for venture advancement.

# STRAP: A Newsvendor Framework for Early Venture Stakeholder Prioritization

## 1. Introduction

Early-stage ventures often face a **critical sequencing decision**: whether to secure supply-side resources (technology, capacity, partners) before demand materializes, or vice versa. Missteps in this prioritization can be fatal. **Webvan**, for example, spent **$1 billion** building automated warehouses and fleets in anticipation of online grocery demand[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=I%20would%20argue%20that%20the,Not%20only%20were%20the%20warehouses). Its facilities ran at barely one-third capacity as customer adoption lagged[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=after%20the%20warehouses%20began%20operating,xv), leading to over $1 billion in losses and bankruptcy by 2001[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=sluggish%20growth%20of%20the%20consumer,acquire%20a%20new%20customer%2022)[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). Conversely, **Better Place** invested **$850 million** in electric vehicle battery-swapping infrastructure up front[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=Better%20Place%20raised%20about%20%24850,Stanley%20and%20VantagePoint%20Capital%20Partners), but fewer than 1,000 cars ultimately used the network[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=The%20bet%20was%20risky%20because,from%20adopting%20any%20one%20standard)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=Better%20Place%20became%20one%20of,from%20Israeli%20President%20Shimon%20Peres). These failures illustrate _overage-cost_ disasters – heavy resource investments with insufficient demand. On the other hand, emphasizing demand first can also be risky: Tesla’s first model (Roadster) amassed eager customers without an established manufacturing base, forcing costly last-minute logistics to deliver on promises (an _underage-cost_ problem). The initial Roadster supply chain spanned three continents and 10-week lead times, so when early units needed design fixes, Tesla had to scramble and incur millions in expedited shipping and rework.

Why do entrepreneurs struggle with such sequencing decisions? In Section 1, we identified three root causes: **(C1)** the lack of a rigorous yet intuitive decision framework (entrepreneurs often rely on gut feel or analogies to other firms), **(C2)** extreme uncertainty about market demand and technology readiness (making it hard to decide which side to bet on first), and **(C3)** the interdependent nature of startup ecosystems (customers, suppliers, and partners each waiting for the other to commit, creating a chicken-and-egg stalemate). Prior research suggests that entrepreneurship as a discipline has lacked unifying theories or frameworks to guide such decisions. This stands in contrast to other fields – e.g. Porter’s five forces in strategy or the CAPM in finance – and leaves founders without clear principles for _“decision-making under uncertainty”. Scholars have begun calling for an **“operations for entrepreneurs”** approach, noting that traditional operations management teaches inventory, supply chain, and capacity planning for established firms, but offers little guidance for new ventures where both demand and supply are unknown. At the same time, emerging research on **Bayesian entrepreneurship** emphasizes that startups must engage in systematic experimentation, learning, and adaptation. Founders should iteratively test hypotheses about their market and technology – effectively treating venture development as a series of experiments – while judiciously managing the costs of failure. However, even with a philosophy of “experiment and learn,” entrepreneurs still need actionable models to decide _which_ experiments to run (e.g. invest in product development or in market development first). Notably, the burden is not only on the founder’s learning; stakeholders (customers, investors, partners) must also be convinced and aligned through these experiments.Thus, a comprehensive framework must account for how early sequencing choices signal and influence other stakeholders in the venture’s ecosystem.
 
**STRAP – the Stakeholder Prioritization framework proposed in this paper – addresses these gaps.** We draw an analogy to the classic _newsvendor problem_ in operations, which balances the cost of ordering too much inventory (overage) versus too little (underage). In a startup context, the “inventory” is not physical stock but organizational commitments – building a product or operations capability in advance versus waiting to secure customers. We model the venture’s two pivotal stakeholder classes (supply-side resource partners and demand-side customers) with binary states (present or not) and associated payoffs. This model yields a simple, rigorous decision rule based on the ratio of underage to overage costs. By framing stakeholder sequencing as an optimization of expected stakeholder _conversion_ value, STRAP offers an intuitive yet formal tool to guide entrepreneurs. It speaks directly to the root causes: providing a unifying decision logic (addressing C1) for ventures to rigorously compare scenarios, incorporating uncertainty via probabilities (addressing C2), and extending to multi-stakeholder interdependencies (addressing C3). In what follows, Section 2 develops the STRAP model in increasing levels of complexity (deterministic, stochastic, and interdependent cases). Section 3 then translates the model’s insights into a practical decision framework, including visual decision maps and case illustrations (Tesla, Better Place, Webvan) that demonstrate cost consequences of sequencing errors and how STRAP could have averted them. Section 4 discusses theoretical and managerial implications, mapping each STRAP mechanism back to the causal barriers (C1–C3) and highlighting how innovation ecosystem approaches (e.g. MIT’s The Engine, Flagship Pioneering) embody similar principles. We conclude in Section 5 with a summary of STRAP’s contributions to entrepreneurship theory and practice as a rigorous, adaptable, yet intuitive framework for early venture decision-making under uncertainty.

## 2. Modeling Stakeholder Sequencing via Newsvendor Analogy

**STRAP conceptualizes the entrepreneur’s dilemma as a 2×2 matrix of stakeholder “states,”** directly paralleling the newsvendor’s demand vs. inventory outcomes. Consider a venture that requires **two complementary stakeholders** to create value: a _resource partner_ (broadly representing the supply-side capacity – this could be a technology development, manufacturing capability, or supplier/investor commitment) and a _lead customer_ (representing market demand validation). Each can be either absent (0) or present (1). **Figure 1** illustrates the four possible state combinations and their cost/value implications:

![[newsvendor(STRAP).png]]
_Figure 1. STRAP stakeholder state matrix and outcomes, in analogy to the newsvendor problem (Underage vs. Overage costs). In state (1,1) both resource and customer are secured, enabling value creation. State (0,0) is the starting point (no commitments, no immediate cost or value). State (1,0) represents an **overage** scenario – the venture has built capacity or secured a supply-side resource without a customer, incurring wasted investment (overage cost $C_o$). State (0,1) represents an **underage** scenario – a willing customer or market demand appears when the venture has no product or capacity to deliver, incurring a lost opportunity or penalty (underage cost $C_u$)._

In this stylized model, the venture’s objective is to move from the start (0,0) to the fully realized (1,1) state while **minimizing the costs of passing through the “one-sided” states (1,0) or (0,1)**. Achieving (1,1) – a successfully matched supply and demand – yields a positive net value $V(1,1)$ (e.g. profit or strategic value from delivering the innovation to a customer). However, reaching (1,1) typically requires first securing one side or the other, which can put the venture transiently into an overage or underage state. The entrepreneur’s sequencing choice is essentially **which cost to risk incurring**: build capacity first and risk having no customer (potential cost $C_o$), or obtain a customer first and risk being unable to deliver immediately (cost $C_u$). This maps directly to inventory decisions: order stock in advance and risk leftover inventory, or wait for orders and risk stockouts.

### 2.1 Deterministic Independent Stakeholders

We begin with a deterministic scenario where the presence of each stakeholder is a decision with certain outcome (a “known-known” environment). The entrepreneur can **choose the sequence** of conversion without uncertainty about eventual outcomes. Suppose converting the resource partner (e.g. building the product or securing a supplier) _will definitely succeed_ and eventually a customer will definitely materialize as well (or vice versa); the only difference sequence makes is whether the venture incurs an interim cost from having one without the other. In this deterministic, single-period setting, the optimal strategy is straightforward: **pursue the sequence that incurs the lesser of the two costs**[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). If the overage cost of having idle capacity is lower (i.e. $C_o < C_u$), the venture should _“build it before they come”_ – secure the resource partner first, then the customer – because disappointing an early customer would be more costly than some idle capacity. Conversely, if the cost of missing out on a ready customer is lower ($C_u < C_o$), the venture should _“get the customer first”_ and delay resource commitments to avoid sunk costs[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). In effect, the **conversion problem reduces to a simple cost-minimization:** the entrepreneur chooses the path that avoids the higher penalty. This result can be intuited from the state matrix: in a deterministic world the venture _will_ reach (1,1) eventually, so any cost incurred is purely due to the temporary mismatch state. Rationally, one should minimize the damage of that temporary state by choosing the sequence with the smaller cost of mismatch.

To illustrate, imagine a startup developing a hardware product. If having a product ready before finding buyers only costs, say, $100K in carrying cost (e.g. small pilot production that could be repurposed) but failing to deliver to an interested early customer would cost $500K (in lost revenue and reputation), the startup should build the product first. If the situation were reversed (e.g. unsold inventory would cost far more than a lost sale), it should secure customer orders or commitments before scaling up production. **This deterministic logic mirrors the classical newsvendor fill-rate result** – if the cost of under-stock (stockout) exceeds the cost of over-stock, stock more (analogous to supply-first), and vice versa[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). In this simplified setting, one can define a **critical cost ratio** $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$: if $r > 0.5$, underage costs dominate (it’s worse to have a customer and no product), so the venture prioritizes the resource side; if $r < 0.5$, overage waste dominates, so the venture prioritizes the customer side. With deterministic outcomes, this rule is intuitive and _always_ avoids the larger mistake.

### 2.2 Stochastic Independent Stakeholders

In reality, of course, outcomes are uncertain – the venture does not know for sure if or when a customer will emerge, nor if a resource can be secured smoothly. We next model a single-period **stochastic scenario (known-unknown)** where the two stakeholders’ arrivals are independent random events. Let $p_c$ be the probability that at least one viable customer is available (i.e. demand exists) in the timeframe of interest, and $p_r$ the probability that a crucial resource partner (or technology milestone) can be attained by that time. “Independent” here means the occurrence of one does not directly affect the probability of the other (we relax this in §2.3). The entrepreneur’s sequencing decision now influences the **expected cost** rather than a guaranteed cost. We evaluate two extreme strategies:

- **Resource-first strategy:** The venture commits to the resource upfront (ensuring $s_r=1$ immediately), then hopes a customer ($s_c=1$) materializes. If demand does not materialize by the end of the period (which occurs with probability $1 - p_c$), the venture ends up in state (1,0) and incurs overage cost $C_o$. If demand does appear ($p_c$ chance), the venture transitions to (1,1) with no lost sales – it can fulfill the demand since capacity is ready. The _expected cost_ of this strategy is $(1 - p_c) \times C_o$ (no underage cost is incurred because any demand that arrives can be met).
    
- **Customer-first strategy:** The venture holds off on building capacity until it sees concrete demand. If a customer appears in the period ($p_c$ probability), initially the state is (0,1) – demand with no supply – causing underage cost $C_u$ (e.g. the startup must delay delivery or lose the sale). Afterward, presumably the venture would rush to build the resource (moving to 1,1, albeit belatedly). If no customer appears ($1 - p_c$ chance), the state stays at (0,0) with no cost (and nothing gained). The expected cost here is $p_c \times C_u$.
    

For simplicity, assume $p_r \approx 1$ for the chosen first action (i.e. if the entrepreneur decides on resource-first, they can successfully secure it – the main uncertainty is on the side they did _not_ secure first). We address $p_r$ shortly, but the key comparison is between the two strategies above. To minimize expected cost, the entrepreneur should choose resource-first if $(1-p_c)C_o < p_c C_u$, and choose customer-first if the opposite holds. Setting $(1-p_c)C_o = p_c C_u$ yields the breakeven probability $p_c^* = \frac{C_o}{C_o + C_u}$. This is analogous to the critical fractile solution in the newsvendor model[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=I%20would%20argue%20that%20the,Not%20only%20were%20the%20warehouses)[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=after%20the%20warehouses%20began%20operating,xv). If the entrepreneur believes the likelihood of demand $p_c$ exceeds this threshold $p_c^*$, then committing to supply is statistically justified (the risk of idle capacity is outweighed by the risk of missing out on likely customers). If $p_c$ is below the threshold, a wait-for-customer approach has the lower expected cost.

It is insightful to express this in terms of the earlier cost ratio $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ (often called the **critical ratio** in inventory theory). Note that $p_c^* = \frac{C_o}{C_o + C_u} = 1 - r$. Thus the rule can be stated as: **invest in the resource first if** $p_c > 1 - r$, **or equivalently if** $p_c + r > 1$. In practice, if the underage penalty is large (high $r$ close to 1), even a moderate chance of demand (say $p_c$ around 0.4 or 0.5) would satisfy $p_c + r > 1$, tipping towards a supply-first action. Conversely, if overage waste is the bigger concern (low $r$), one would need a very high confidence in demand materializing to justify building early. Indeed, in the special case where $p_c= p_r = 0.5$ (maximum uncertainty), the decision reduces purely to the cost ratio: $r > 0.5$ implies supply-first, $r < 0.5$ implies customer-first. The **critical ratio $r = C_u/(C_u+C_o)$ thus serves as a concise guide** for stakeholder prioritization under uncertainty, just as it guides stocking levels in inventory management[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). This approach gives quantitative rigor to the often nebulous startup question of _“How sure do we need to be before we scale up?”_ – the answer: sure enough that the probability-weighted downside of waiting exceeds that of acting now.

We now briefly consider the role of $p_r$, the probability of successfully securing the resource side in a timely way. In many ventures, achieving supply-side readiness is itself uncertain (e.g. an R&D breakthrough might succeed or fail, a key supplier may or may not sign on). For a **complete expected value analysis**, we would enumerate all four probabilistic outcomes: success of both sides, neither, or just one side. If the entrepreneur goes resource-first, the chance of ending up in (1,0) is $(1-p_c)\times p_r$ (demand doesn’t show, but resource succeeded) plus the possibility that the resource effort fails outright (which might be seen as remaining in (0,0) with some wasted effort – we can fold any sunk R&D cost into $C_o$ for simplicity). Likewise, customer-first could be expanded to consider probability $p_r$ that once a customer is in hand, the venture can quickly secure the resource (e.g. raise money or partner to deliver). If that second-step resource effort fails, the venture stays stuck in (0,1) and likely dies. The math can be extended, but the core insight is unchanged: the optimal policy equates the **expected marginal cost** of each strategy. In practice, entrepreneurs seldom have precise $p_c$ or $p_r$ values; thus, STRAP’s recommendation is to focus on **relative cost severity (the $r$ ratio)**. This is both easier to estimate (founders can often approximate potential loss from a blown customer deal vs. wasted investment) and directly linked to action: it tells which mistake would hurt more, and thereby which stakeholder to prioritize in order to avoid that mistake. We will see in Section 3 how this critical ratio logic cleanly delineates _“customer-first” vs. “supplier-first” zones_ for venture strategy.

### 2.3 Stochastic **Interdependent** Stakeholders

Thus far, we assumed that securing a customer has no influence on the probability of securing a supplier (or vice versa). In reality, **stakeholder outcomes are often interdependent** – success on one side can significantly increase the odds of success on the other. This is a classic _chicken-and-egg_ dynamic in innovation ecosystems[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=The%20bet%20was%20risky%20because,from%20adopting%20any%20one%20standard)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=Skeptics%20had%20long%20wondered%20about,focus%20on%20Israel%20and%20Denmark). For instance, a corporate partner might be more willing to manufacture your product _if_ you can show paying customers (reducing their risk), and customers are more likely to adopt _if_ you have a credible production and support plan. When positive interdependence is present, the act of converting one stakeholder can **directly improve the prospects** of attracting the other. We can extend the model by introducing a **correlation or cross-impact parameter** $\rho$ between stakeholder outcomes. One way to capture this is to let the conditional success probability of the second stakeholder increase given the first stakeholder is secured. For example, instead of $p_c$ being fixed, we might have $P(\text{customer success} | \text{resource secured}) = p_c + \Delta$, with $\Delta > 0$ reflecting the boost due to the resource commitment (analogously $P(\text{resource success}| \text{customer secured}) = p_r + \Delta'$). A positive $\rho$ means the joint probability $P(s_c=1 \text{ and } s_r=1)$ is greater than $p_c p_r$ – intuitively, the stakeholder outcomes reinforce each other.

The decision logic in this interdependent case still hinges on comparing expected costs, but those expected costs must account for the _dynamic feedback_. The entrepreneur should consider the **marginal value of securing one stakeholder first**, including how it improves the chances of landing the second. Formally, the expected cost of, say, the resource-first strategy becomes: $E[\text{Cost}| \text{res-first}] = P(\text{no customer follows} \mid s_r!=!1)\times C_o$. Under positive interdependence, $P(\text{no customer} | s_r=1)$ will be _lower_ than the base $(1-p_c)$, because having the resource in hand makes customer conversion easier. Denote this conditional probability as $(1 - p_c')$ with $p_c' = p_c + \delta$ (where $\delta$ is some function of $\rho$). Similarly, for the customer-first strategy, the likelihood of ending in (0,1) without securing a resource is reduced if having a customer attracts a partner or investor to build the resource. In effect, **securing either stakeholder first not only carries its direct cost risk, but also reduces the opposite-side risk**. To decide optimally, one can calculate the _net expected payoff_ of each sequence: e.g. the resource-first approach yields the full venture value $V(1,1)$ if it triggers eventual customer success (probability $p_c'$), or fails (cost $C_o$) if the customer never comes (probability $1-p_c'$). The customer-first yields $V(1,1)$ if a resource partner subsequently joins (probability $p_r'$) and costs $C_u$ if no resource materializes in time ($1-p_r'$). Setting up these equations, the condition for resource-first being better becomes:  
$$pc′⋅V(1,1)−(1−pc′)Co  >  pr′⋅V(1,1)−(1−pr′)Cu.p_c' \cdot V(1,1) - (1-p_c')C_o \;>\; p_r' \cdot V(1,1) - (1-p_r')C_u.pc′​⋅V(1,1)−(1−pc′​)Co​>pr′​⋅V(1,1)−(1−pr′​)Cu​.$$  
Rearranging, this essentially compares $\frac{C_u}{1-p_r'}$ vs. $\frac{C_o}{1-p_c'}$ (the “adjusted” cost ratios after accounting for how much each first action reduces the failure chance of the second). Although the algebra can become involved, the intuition is clear: **positive correlation amplifies the advantage of whichever side has the higher inherent pull on the other.** If securing a customer strongly increases the likelihood of rallying the supply side (as is often true when a credible marquee customer attracts investors or partners), that tilts the equation in favor of customer-first beyond what the static cost ratio alone would suggest. Conversely, if building the technology or securing a key supplier deal substantially boosts customer confidence or network effects, then supply-first becomes even more attractive. In many cases, interdependence will reinforce the original critical-ratio decision: e.g. in markets where overage cost was high (favoring customer-first) it’s often also true that having customers is critical to convince resource-side stakeholders, doubling down on the need to get demand first.

There are scenarios, however, where **interdependence can flip a decision at the margin**. Imagine a situation where $C_u$ and $C_o$ are roughly equal (say moderate costs either way, so $r \approx 0.5$), but one stakeholder type is significantly more “magnetic” for the other. Perhaps customers inherently won’t sign without a working prototype, but once you have a prototype the customers flood in (high $\rho$ favoring supply-first). Or vice versa: maybe suppliers are plentiful but will only bother if you have confirmed market interest (favoring customer-first). In such borderline cases, the _marginal value_ analysis says to prioritize the stakeholder that yields a larger increase in joint success probability. In other words, ask: _which side, if secured first, does more to de-risk the overall venture by inducing the other side?_ That side should be tackled first. This aligns with the logic of **marginal experimentation value** in Bayesian entrepreneurship – allocate resources to the action that most reduces uncertainty about viabilityfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3cfile-689zeqgkzwbfagddcapwxx. STRAP formalizes this by incorporating cross-stakeholder effects into the expected value calculations, ensuring the guidance remains valid even when stakeholders are connected in a network of influence.

In summary, the STRAP model yields a **progressively refined decision rule**. In the simplest case, compare the two error costs and avoid the bigger one. Under uncertainty, weigh the costs by their likelihood via the critical ratio $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u+C_o}$ – a high $r$ (above 0.5) dictates a _supplier-first_ strategy to avoid steep underage penalties, while a low $r$ favors a _customer-first_ approach to avoid large overage waste. In complex ecosystems, additionally account for how one stakeholder’s early conversion increases the probability of the other’s arrival; prioritize the stakeholder that provides a greater overall chance of reaching the win-win state (1,1). We next translate these analytical insights into an actionable framework and illustrate them with real venture cases.

## 3. STRAP Decision Framework and Illustrative Cases

To make STRAP’s insights concrete, we present a **decision map** that entrepreneurs can use to determine their strategic “zone,” and we apply it to the cases of Tesla (Roadster program), Better Place, and Webvan. These examples epitomize the cost consequences of sequencing errors and the potential benefits had STRAP been applied. **Table 1** summarizes the critical inputs for each case, and **Figure 2** visualizes their trajectories and outcomes:

- **Better Place (Battery Swap Infrastructure, 2007–2013):** _Actual approach:_ **Supplier-Extreme.** Better Place built an extensive network of battery swap stations (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0)) well before securing sufficient EV customers, leading to an (1,0) _failed_ state – the company went bankrupt after burning through ~$850M[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=Better%20Place%20raised%20about%20%24850,Stanley%20and%20VantagePoint%20Capital%20Partners). No meaningful customer base ever materialized ((0,1) was never reached before collapse). _STRAP analysis:_ Better Place’s underage cost $C_u$ (the missed opportunity of not having infrastructure if EV demand surged unexpectedly) was relatively small – perhaps some foregone early market, on the order of tens of millions. In stark contrast, the overage cost $C_o$ of all that infrastructure was enormous (hundreds of millions). Thus its $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u+C_o}$ was near 0.06, **deep in the “customer-first” zone**. STRAP would have recommended a **customer validation first** sequence: (0,0) → (0,1) by gauging real demand (e.g. piloting with a small fleet of EVs or securing commitments from drivers/companies), and only then investing in scaling infrastructure → (1,1). This staged approach might have saved on the order of $650M+` in upfront investment, deploying capital incrementally as adoption proved out. It could have prevented Better Place’s oversized bet and ultimate write-off.
    
- **Webvan (Online Groceries, 1996–2001):** _Actual approach:_ **Both-Extreme (Over-ambitious scaling).** Webvan simultaneously attempted to build out supply capacity in multiple cities and stimulate demand, effectively going to (1,0) in a big way (26 massive automated warehouses) and assuming it would quickly get to (1,1*) “hyperscale.” In reality, after launch many warehouses remained severely underutilized (a quasi-(1,0) state persisted), and while some customers came ((1,1) in a few markets), the economics were abysmal – the venture soon collapsed, reverting to (0,0). Over $1B was spent on infrastructure that far outpaced demand[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=I%20would%20argue%20that%20the,Not%20only%20were%20the%20warehouses)[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=after%20the%20warehouses%20began%20operating,xv). _STRAP analysis:_ Webvan’s underage cost $C_u$ might be construed as the “missed market opportunity” of not being first-mover in online groceries – sizable in theory (they feared losing the race), but arguably much smaller than the overage cost $C_o$ of premature expansion (automated warehouses costing $35M each and $125M/quarter in overhead)[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=I%20would%20argue%20that%20the,Not%20only%20were%20the%20warehouses). Indeed, Webvan did **no serious consumer testing** of its model before scaling[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too), a critical misstep. We estimate a critical ratio on the order of $r \approx 0.30$ for Webvan (still firmly <0.5), indicating **customer-first**. STRAP would have suggested _“customer validation then scale”_: start in one city with a modest, low-capex operation to verify demand and unit economics ((0,0) → (0,1) small scale), adjust the model, and only build advanced warehouses once consistent demand was proven ((1,1) in one market, then carefully expand). This could have saved perhaps $1B by scaling with proven economics rather than blindly building capacity for theoretical demand. Webvan’s fate exemplifies how _overestimating demand and undervaluing overage costs_ leads to catastrophe – exactly what STRAP’s disciplined ratio aims to prevent.
    
- **Tesla Roadster (Electric Sports Car, 2006–2008):** _Actual approach:_ **Customer-First (with costly scrambling).** Tesla in its early days focused on proving market demand for EVs. They took deposits from customers and hyped the Roadster (effectively moving to (0,1) – hundreds of customers committed with minimal product ready) Meanwhile, they struggled to finalize the supply chain and production. The first units faced delays and quality issues, and Tesla had to make design changes on the fly. As a result, to deliver Roadsters to waiting customers, Tesla incurred approximately **$3.8M in expedited air freight** and other emergency measures (an underage cost) when the planned outsourced production had bottlenecksfile-rz7f6brhqgkewnysnkwd7s. Eventually Tesla achieved (1,1), delivering about 500 Roadsters and proving demand for premium EVs, but not without this underage penalty. _STRAP analysis:_ For the Roadster, one can estimate $C_u$ as the cost of disappointing early customers or delaying deliveries (multi-million-dollar rush costs, plus some reputation risk), and $C_o$ as the hypothetical cost if they had built more capacity than needed (in Tesla’s case, they actually had more demand than supply at first – so the idle capacity risk was low, perhaps $2–3M worth of extra capacity would have been the worst-case). This yields a critical ratio roughly $r \approx 0.60$. **Tesla’s scenario lies in the “supplier-first” zone (CR > 0.5)**. STRAP would have recommended securing more of the supply chain upfront ((0,0) → (1,0) on a small scale) before accepting so many customer orders, thus avoiding the pricey last-minute fixes. In practice, Tesla’s resource constraints forced a bit of a customer-first approach – they needed the customer deposits for cash. Nevertheless, once they experienced those underage costs, Tesla adjusted for later models. Notably, for the Model 3, Tesla did both: they **took 400,000+ preorders** to validate mass-market demand _and_ simultaneously invested in the Gigafactory to secure battery supply[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/tesla-ceo-musk-almost-400000-orders-received-for-new-model-3-idUSKCN0XI15E/#:~:text=OSLO%20%28Reuters%29%20,its%20CEO%20said%20on%20Thursday), a balanced approach reflecting STRAP logic.

**Figure 2** (below) situates these cases on the STRAP decision map. The top panel shows the **Critical Ratio Decision Framework**, dividing the strategy space into a _Supplier-First Zone (blue, $r>0.5$)_ and a _Customer-First Zone (green, $r<0.5$)_. Each venture is plotted by its estimated $r$: Tesla around 0.60 in the supplier-first zone (blue point), Webvan ~0.30 and Better Place ~0.06 in the customer-first zone (green points). The actual approaches taken are noted (Tesla actually went more customer-first, Webvan “both-extreme,” Better Place supplier-first extreme) along with the costs incurred. The middle panel illustrates **state transition sequences** and cost outcomes for each case: Tesla’s actual path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) incurred an underage cost of $3.8M, whereas STRAP would have suggested (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1) avoiding that cost; Better Place’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 0,0 failure) cost $850M and could have been replaced by a STRAP path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) with staged growth; Webvan’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1* → 0,0 collapse) burned through $1B, whereas STRAP would advise (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) scaling only after validation. The bottom panel distills the **STRAP decision logic** with definitions: it emphasizes that when _underage costs dominate (disappointing customers is costlier)_ – i.e. high $r$, supplier-first is optimal; when _overage costs dominate (wasted resources are costlier)_ – low $r$, customer-first is optimal. Each case’s numbers exemplify these situations. The key formula $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ is provided as a handy guide. Together, these visuals serve as a quick reference for entrepreneurs to categorize their venture and glean the recommended sequencing strategy at a glance.

## 4. Discussion

The STRAP framework contributes to both theory and practice by addressing the three root causes (C1–C3) that commonly derail stakeholder prioritization in new ventures. We discuss each in turn, linking STRAP’s mechanisms to the underlying challenges and highlighting implications for entrepreneurial management and ecosystem design.

- **C1: Lack of a rigorous decision framework.** Entrepreneurs have historically operated without a clear analytical tool for sequencing decisionsfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c. This gap (the “missing framework” problem) often leads to decisions driven by hype, fear of missing out, or imitating others, rather than systematic analysisfile-nr54fhytxxcpvrezvbwyc6. STRAP provides a much-needed **unifying framework**file-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c: it is grounded in operations management logic (cost optimization under uncertainty) yet simplified for entrepreneurial use (a 2×2 schema and a single ratio). By translating the abstract trade-offs into a concrete critical ratio, STRAP enables founders to **quantify their bias** – often revealing, for example, that their eagerness to build product might vastly outweigh the actual cost of testing the market first (or vice versa). This mechanism directly addresses C1 by giving structure to decision-making under uncertaintyfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c. Founders can set up their best estimates of $C_o$ and $C_u$ (even if rough), immediately see which is larger, and use the $r$ heuristic to sanity-check their strategy. Moreover, STRAP links to familiar concepts (the inventory newsvendor analogy), making it **intuitive and teachable**. This aligns with the call for “operations for entrepreneurs” – distinctive principles tailored to startup contextsfile-nr54fhytxxcpvrezvbwyc6. Just as Porter’s Five Forces gave strategists a toolkit for industry analysis, STRAP aims to give entrepreneurs a practical toolkit for stakeholder sequencing. Theoretically, it embeds entrepreneurial action in a value-maximization framework, helping bridge the disciplinary gap between entrepreneurship (often seen as art or instinct) and operations sciencefile-nr54fhytxxcpvrezvbwyc6file-nr54fhytxxcpvrezvbwyc6.
    
- **C2: Uncertainty and the need for Bayesian learning.** A core tenet of entrepreneurship is that it requires **decision-making under extreme uncertainty, through experimentation and learning**file-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c. However, entrepreneurs struggle with which experiments to run and how to update their strategy in light of noisy datafile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3cfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c. STRAP’s incorporation of probability ($p_c$, $p_r$) and expected costs directly connects to a **Bayesian approach** – essentially treating each sequencing choice as an experiment with an expected value. By focusing attention on the _relative_ consequences (underage vs. overage), STRAP encourages founders to consider _“Which mistake would be more damaging given what I currently believe?”_ and thus which side to test first. This is akin to choosing an experiment that maximizes information gain while minimizing downside. For example, if a founder’s prior belief in market demand is low but the cost of testing that demand is also low (relative to building the whole product), STRAP would lean toward a demand-first test (customer discovery, crowdfunding, etc.). This resonates with lean startup philosophy – “test the riskiest assumption first” – but formalizes it in cost termsfile-689zeqgkzwbfagddcapwxx. Importantly, STRAP also illuminates when a more aggressive approach is warranted: if a founder’s prior belief in demand is high and not having supply ready would be very costly, it may actually be optimal to invest ahead of full validation (the Tesla case illustrates this nuance). In other words, STRAP refines the experimental design by quantifying the opportunity cost of delay vs. the cost of potential wasted effort. This helps overcome cognitive biases – e.g. overconfidence or fear of failure – by anchoring decisions to cost/benefit logic. From a scholarly perspective, STRAP operationalizes Bayesian entrepreneurship conceptsfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c in a prescriptive model. It offers a concrete instantiation of how entrepreneurs can apply Bayesian reasoning (updating and expected value) to real strategic choices. The framework thus serves as a stepping stone towards a **more rigorous, economics-driven theory of entrepreneurial sequencing**, complementing recent work on entrepreneurial strategy under uncertainty.
    
- **C3: Interdependent stakeholder ecosystems.** Modern innovation often unfolds in **ecosystems** where startups, customers, corporates, investors, and universities all play interlinked roles. A venture’s challenge is not just internal (build product or get customers) but _external_: orchestrating a network so that supply and demand emerge together. C3 identified that entrepreneurs often fail to account for these interdependencies, leading to stalemates (each stakeholder waits for others, so none come forward) or miscoordination (e.g. oversupplying an ecosystem that isn’t ready). STRAP’s extension to the interdependent case directly tackles this by advising entrepreneurs to _choose the sequencing that best catalyzes the ecosystem_. In practical terms, it means identifying **which stakeholder, if secured, will trigger a positive cascade**. The framework’s marginal analysis of cross-impacts (Section 2.3) guides founders to think in terms of network effects: e.g. “If I sign up a marquee customer, will it enable me to attract a manufacturing partner quickly? Or if I develop this technology breakthrough, will it convince regulators and customers to come on board?” By making such considerations explicit, STRAP helps avoid the common pitfall of treating stakeholders in isolation. This has clear managerial relevance: entrepreneurs can use STRAP not only for go/no-go on product vs. market first, but to sequence any multi-stakeholder engagement (such as which strategic partner to bring in first to entice others). Furthermore, the framework underscores the value of **ecosystem enablers** – third parties that can reduce interdependence friction. For example, MIT’s **The Engine** tough-tech accelerator provides startups with laboratory space and connects them with corporate partners earlyfile-hbs3zlubepv6d8m2ijkvz9, effectively lowering $C_o$ (startups don’t have to build their own facilities) _and_ increasing $p_c$ by giving credibility and network access. STRAP would view such support as shifting startups toward the favorable region where they can afford to validate demand without huge overage costs. Similarly, **Flagship Pioneering’s** venture creation model heavily stages investment in science ventures, doing many small experiments in-house before committing big capital. This reduces the overage cost of any single venture by stopping those that don’t validate early hypotheses, and it leverages interdependence by centralizing resources that can quickly scale a project once a customer/market signal appearsfile-5mnb6clm7xf5tysaqtbgjl. In essence, STRAP provides a conceptual rationale for why such ecosystem approaches work: they are lowering one side of the equation or adding correlation (e.g. Flagship’s reputation and resources make it easier to get partners once a concept is proven). The takeaway is that entrepreneurs should actively seek ways to **convert sequential problems into parallel progress** – if you can’t get both stakeholders at once, use creative methods (like The Engine’s corporate days or government pilot programs) to simulate one side and reduce the risk of engaging the other. STRAP’s interdependence logic thus equips entrepreneurs to navigate network effects more systematically, and it provides policymakers and ecosystem builders a framework to identify where startups most need support (where $C_o$ or $C_u$ is prohibitive or where linking stakeholders could unlock progress).
    

Overall, STRAP addresses C1–C3 by combining _decision rigor_ with a nuanced understanding of entrepreneurial contexts. It turns the abstract perils of “going too fast” vs “waiting too long” into quantifiable parameters, and it acknowledges that startups do not operate in a vacuum but in a web of interdependent players. This dual attention to **analytic clarity and ecosystem dynamics** is a step forward for the field of entrepreneurial operations. It also opens avenues for further research – for instance, extending the model to multi-period decision-making (when to pivot if initial sequencing was wrong, how to dynamically update $p_c$ as experiments run, etc.), or exploring heterogeneous risk preferences (founders might choose a higher-risk sequence if upside is larger, akin to newsvendor with risk preferences). The model could be empirically tested using retrospective analyses of startup cohorts (did those with higher critical ratios indeed perform better by going supply-first, etc.). For practitioners, the framework offers an actionable checklist: estimate your $C_u$ and $C_o$, position yourself on the STRAP map, and strategize how to either execute that game plan or adjust your business model to improve those parameters (e.g. find ways to reduce an exorbitant $C_o$ through partnerships).

## 5. Conclusion

This paper introduced **STRAP – a Stakeholder Prioritization framework for early ventures –** which marries principles of operations management with the realities of entrepreneurial uncertainty. By recasting the classic newsvendor inventory problem in the context of startup stakeholders, STRAP provides a rigorous yet **intuitive tool** for tackling the “which comes first” conundrum that every founder of a two-sided venture faces. The framework’s core contribution is the critical ratio heuristic, offering clear decision rules (supplier-first vs. customer-first) backed by expected cost calculations. We demonstrated STRAP’s relevance with case studies of three emblematic startups, showing that many infamous failures can be reinterpreted as _critical ratio mismatches_ – founders bet on the wrong side of the ratio and incurred avoidable costs that sank their venture. Conversely, successful entrepreneurs, like those at Tesla, implicitly navigated towards STRAP-optimal decisions (and when they did not, they paid the price and adapted).

Theoretically, STRAP contributes to the emerging dialogue on **entrepreneurial operations and Bayesian strategy**, bridging a gap between qualitative startup advice and quantitative decision analysisfile-nr54fhytxxcpvrezvbwyc6file-689zeqgkzwbfagddcapwxx. It offers a concrete framework to unify discussions of product-market fit, MVP testing, pivoting, and scaling under one analytical umbrella. Practically, it arms founders (and educators, accelerators, investors) with a method to debate and justify sequencing choices. Rather than defaulting to slogans like “build it and they will come” or “sell it then build it,” entrepreneurs can articulate their strategy in terms of costs and probabilities – _“Our underage cost (losing the market window) is far greater than the overage cost, so we’re investing in capacity ahead of demand, and here’s why…”_. This elevates the conversation to one of **informed trade-offs** and risk management, which is exactly what professionalization of entrepreneuring entailsfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3cfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3c.

In closing, STRAP is a step toward a more **rigorous, adaptable, and intuitive framework** for stakeholder prioritization in early-stage ventures. It is rigorous in grounding decisions in cost-benefit analysis and probability; it is adaptable in that it can accommodate additional complexities (interdependence, multi-period updates, etc.) as needed; and it is intuitive, leveraging visual tools and analogies that make its insights accessible to practitioners. We believe STRAP’s newsvendor analogy will resonate with entrepreneurs who seek structure without losing the agility and creativity that entrepreneurship requires. Ultimately, by helping ventures avoid fatal sequencing errors and allocate their scarce resources more wisely, STRAP contributes to both the theory of entrepreneurial decision-making and the practice of venture formation. It provides a common language for founders, investors, and ecosystem partners to discuss strategy with clarity – an advance that, we hope, will improve the success odds of novel innovations navigating the precarious early stages.
