- Nathaniel (sequential Monte Carlo)
- hybrid modeling (ventity; network has a matrix - lots of zeros; dynamic memory allocation - cannot erase agents) vs discrete event simulation? (agent-based modeling; dicrete, factory; no encomy or school) - hybrid is continuous; state is estimation of failure times

- model (compartment)
- when do you usually decide to define fractional variable?
- hill climbing? (price discovery by hill climbing: discovery)
- feedback on material, information, enery open/closed system
- boom and bust related to human-behavior-based oscillation?
- motivation for introducing [game](http://vensim.com/documentation/usr11.html)
- mix of continuous (cont vehicles) and discrete (discrete house), aggregate

### 01.28
pallet shipping (immediate techical) - allocate, benefit

tom's hier. of interest: limits of growth (human) - health care, education, climate change - 
expected value (preserve discrete deer - newly infected is small)
target variable of interest (change 10%), structural decision making (process plan review), combinatorial explosion, 
vehicle (J.struben) driving transition, 

EV (lithium, cobalt), scaling truck (load - giant battery)
one gas vehicle hybrid (range anxiety - won't buy)
understanding defects of the model (construct general purpose) - pill turn blue

grid (adequacy of electric supply - coal plant shutting down, s)
nord house regional model (adjust ob - rich ppl have more money b) - confused descriptive and normative of income (genocide)

spatial distribution of charging and clustering
road electrification of city (majority of ppl have garage), get power from (charger) - 1.allow houses to run cable 2. public infrastructure (light post - plug)

interesting dynamics 
know desried goal from aggregate - vote taking place (lower), N(21, 1)
feedback btw (observing the failure, maintenace and manufacturing schedule) + user error (Experience; different connector - evolution - dominant connector)
property owner get tax credit only for buying; tesla super charger
env. important, ppl have weird idea so benefit improve
