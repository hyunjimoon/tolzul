| **Core Theme**                  | Pre- and post-entry learning connected to decisions under uncertainty             | Decision-making dynamics within founding teams                  | Experimentation and pivoting as strategies for managing uncertainty               |
| **Focus on Entry/Exit**         | Explores excess entry and delayed exit as outcomes of biased and rational learning | Team-based dynamics affecting both entry and exit decisions      | Role of iterative testing and pivoting in overconfident entrepreneurial behavior  |
| **Primary Model Used**          | Bayesian computational learning model with bias incorporated                      | Behavioral decision-making framework applied to teams           | Dynamic programming and experimentation-based decision-making                     |
| **Key Contributions**           | Highlights misattributed biases in rational entry/exit decisions                   | Illuminates how team overconfidence impacts survival outcomes   | Expands on pivoting strategies under overconfidence                               |
| **Role of Overconfidence**      | Examines forms of overconfidence (e.g., estimation, precision biases)              | Assesses collective overconfidence in partnerships              | Applies overconfidence to experimentation dynamics                                |
| **Integration of Entry/Exit**   | Pre-entry learning shapes post-entry dynamics                                      | Partnerships influence timing and likelihood of entry/exit      | Experiments condition strategic redirection and potential exit                    |

#### Insights into Progression:
1. **Conceptual Depth**:
   - The 2018 paper establishes foundational learning dynamics and integrates Bayesian rationality with biases.
   - The 2022 paper expands the scope to team decision-making, considering partnerships' influence on strategic choices.
   - The 2024 paper shifts to dynamic, iterative processes of pivoting as a practical strategy, incorporating feedback loops for both experimentation and exit optimization.

2. **Model Evolution**:
   - The models progress from individual-focused Bayesian learning to group-focused decision-making frameworks and finally to dynamic programming tailored to entrepreneurial pivots.

3. **Shared Theme Exploration**:
   - Across all three papers, the interplay of learning, bias, and decision-making shapes the trajectory of firms from entry through potential exit. Each paper adds layers of complexity and specificity (e.g., individual to team dynamics, static to dynamic strategies).

- **With replacement** resembles a **flexible learning approach** that keeps the system open to ongoing consumer feedback, helping it adapt over time.
- **Without replacement** resembles a **rigid learning approach** where early preferences dominate, causing the economy to converge on one technology faster, even if it might not be the best long-term choice.
