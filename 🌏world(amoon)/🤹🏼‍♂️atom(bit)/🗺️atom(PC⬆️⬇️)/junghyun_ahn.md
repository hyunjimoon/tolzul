todo: entropy is usually high (all combinations of microstate log); summing the log probability over probability. When everything is concentrated in one place it is low entropy. Not sure why it is high (potential) entropy



Updated Emojis:
- A_n → 🌊 (waves representing inherent turbulence in market/customer needs)
- A_s → ⚗️ (lab equipment representing systematic technical experimentation)
- E_n → 🧲 (magnet representing attractive/pulling force of market knowledge)

Prescriptive Decision Table:

| Uncertainty State | Sampling 👓 | Deciding 🤜 | Internal Loop 🔁 | External Loop 🔄 |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| High 🌊, Low ⚗️, Low 🧲 | Many parallel samples | Quick MVP testing | Basic screening | Heavy customer testing (e.g., rapid customer feedback) |
| Low 🌊, High ⚗️, Low 🧲 | Systematic lab testing | Evidence-based decisions | Deep technical screening (e.g., ex vivo testing) | Limited market testing |
| Low 🌊, Low ⚗️, High 🧲 | Sequential market sampling | Staged rollout | Basic technical validation | Global market exploration (e.g., Singapore, Saudi) |
| High 🌊, High ⚗️, Low 🧲 | Multi-track testing | Data-driven decisions | Enhanced screening (e.g., pharma molecule screening) | Focused user testing |
| High 🌊, Low ⚗️, High 🧲 | Mixed testing strategy | Iterative launches | Market validation | Multi-region testing (e.g., US, Asia markets) |

Uncertainty Comparison Table:

| Uncertainty Type | Nature | Example | Expert Alignment | Testing Strategy |
|-----------------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| 🌊 Need (A_n) | Random variation in market needs | Tesla battery: home vs EV market | Low alignment (consumer products) | Multiple parallel market tests |
| ⚗️ Solution (A_s) | Technical experimentation variance | Pharma molecule screening, NVIDIA chip design | High alignment (deep tech) | Systematic lab testing |
| 🧲 Need (E_n) | Market knowledge attraction | BYD's hybrid strategy for EU/US markets | Medium alignment | Sequential market exploration |

Nature of Uncertainties:

| Aspect | 🌊 Need Aleatoric | ⚗️ Solution Aleatoric | 🧲 Need Epistemic |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Source | Market turbulence | Experimental variance | Knowledge gaps |
| Reducibility | Not reducible | Reducible through systematic testing | Reducible through market exploration |
| Expert Agreement | Low (e.g., consumer products) | High (e.g., pharmaceuticals) | Medium-Low (varies by region) |
| Testing Approach | Many quick market tests | Systematic lab experiments | Sequential market entry |
| Example | PayPal/Tesla stock predictions | Luber Sol chemical testing | Ford's manufacturing knowledge integration |
| Time Horizon | Short-term (MVP testing) | Medium-term (lab validation) | Long-term (market development) |
| Cost to Test | Low per test (customer feedback) | High per test (ex vivo, in vivo) | Medium, escalating (market entry) |

Let me analyze how 🎨⚗️🔦 maps to the SAJ (Scientist, Artist, Judge) framework from the document:

| Emoji                 | SAJ Role  | Alignment Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                | Match?         |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 🎨 (Creative palette) | Artist    | Strong alignment: Both represent:<br>- Imagining what could be<br>- Expanding perspectives<br>- Creating new possibilities<br>- "To imagine what is not yet perceived"                                            | ✓ Strong Match |
| ⚗️ (Lab equipment)    | Scientist | Strong alignment: Both represent:<br>- Systematic testing<br>- Understanding how things work<br>- Verification through evidence<br>- "To identify what aspects cause other aspects to change"                     | ✓ Strong Match |
| ⚖️ (Flashlight)       | Judge     | Weak/No alignment: <br>- 🔦 represents illuminating/discovering truth<br>- Judge is about evaluating worth/appropriateness<br>- "To identify benefits and harms"<br>- Better emoji for Judge might be ⚖️ (scales) | ✗ Poor Match   |

Recommendation:
If we want to stay true to the SAJ framework, we should either:
1. Replace 🔦 with a more evaluative emoji like ⚖️ (scales of justice), or
2. Reconsider our uncertainty classification system to better match what 🔦 actually represents (illumination/discovery)

The document emphasizes that the Judge role is about appraising value and determining what "should" be done, which doesn't align well with the illuminating nature of 🔦.
