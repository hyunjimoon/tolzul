three questions to ask: 
1. tips for "assessing fit and buy-in", "establishing control"
2. "pressured to execute quickly before they had before they have had a chance to establish control" (=entrepreneurs need investors who will give them sufficient time to properly set up their business infrastructure and competitive advantages, rather than rushing them to market prematurely) from scott's textbook:
	> Implementation of an architectural strategy often requires large amounts of upfront investment (especially relative to disruption) in planning and making strategic commitments to build an entirely new value chain. architectural entrepreneurs must be diligent in assessing fit and buy-in with potential investors, and ensure that they will not be pressured to execute quickly before they have had a chance to establish control.

Dear xx,

May 15th is my favorite Korean holiday: teacher's day.

May 15th (1397) is King Sejong's birthday. He was a versatile leader as military strategist, linguist, scientist, economist, historian and even musician.

You may wonder why his birthday became teacher's day. He may be a great leader but did he teach us anything? I think yes: independence. Thanks to him, Koreans have our own letter (Hangul), own land, own time and space measure (Angbuilgu, Chiljeongsan), and ceremonial music (Aak). Recalling why we learn, helping others become independent may be the greatest form of teaching.

You may also wonder why I'm telling this story. It's because Bayesian Entrepreneurship gave me independence. Entrepreneurial strategy; language on prior, execute and control, compete and collaborate; science of experiment design; economy of pivoting; history of Entrepreneurship, and even Baba's rap!

Thanks for everything, Scott.
Angie

Resource rationality captures tradeoff between resource for inference and decision making.

The topic Scott assigned high score, "resource allocation between operational capability (OC) vs market testing (MT)" uses this. Investing in OC vs MT increases quality of technology/organization choice vs customer/competitor choice, just like investing in inference (`infer`) vs decision making (`argmax`) increase quality of inferred parameters and decision.

Tuning to Scott's language on four entrepreneurial axioms, three ways to lower learning noise:
1. decrease freedom: anchoring e.g. zappos
2. increase resource: rich gets richer e.g. elon's deep pocket for tesla roadster
3. decrease uncertainty: intermediate chains e.g. scott-charlie-angie-vikash 

food for thought: as costs for testing/partial learning decreases, which of the 1,2,3 would become the most effective? i tested 1,3 and found them effective, but cost for experimenting 2 is not cheap.

P.S. Thanks Scott, I understood how proposition [??] captures essential heterogeneity

I bet can be other methods can be interpreted as empirical bayes

I'm logging this as the greatest gradient descent between our world models.

One theory I am protecting since 2022 is that the two should and can be integrated. This is in ilne with J.Forrestor's purposeful modeling. The exact same button is used to execute the two in system dynamics software.

It took some time to infer statistician's world model that led to her comment "I don't think b-school scholars do anything useful" when I presented the attached. 

But I had fun time testing your theories by applying to Bayesian software's business model (value create/capture:p.15, clockspeed:p.16).
