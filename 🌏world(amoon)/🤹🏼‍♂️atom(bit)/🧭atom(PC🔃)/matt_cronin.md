Matt: M, Angie: A

1. finally nailed on the "language" to frame machine's role - problem, not the choice itself. e.g. if an entrepreneur was suggested an offer of $7m investment with 20% ownership, what is the meaning of this? i.e. what problem is this? 
- Is "How much money is 20% worth?" the problem?
- Is "How much control do I lose if I don't if I lose 20%" the problem? 
- Is "How much am I limited in the future" the problem?

Each of those problems is simultaneously happening. But human can only think about one (or few) of them i.e. can't play 3D chess.
 
2. Theory and Practice in Research - A criticized Ed Robert's heuristics "ENT scholars shouldn't write about a research question that entrepreneurial practitioners don't know what to do with it" (of course I can infer the context of its origin). In Matt's language, unit theory developer has one's unique role - which Matt agreed. (but one person trying to do everything somehow is burdening: https://otter.ai/s/PBYEaew5SFm3DTEUZmuHcQ?snpt=true.)

3. M resonated with the mess in management field and introduced "holding environment" https://otter.ai/s/7yR98mCaTum-vkyafOIy5Q?snpt=true "we the medical field have a way of getting making it our business to understand and, like, manage the emotions that when you do that, so it's not just you who's trying to deal with it, management doesn't really do that. In fact, management loads it back onto us and says, you know, you have to be better at this. Why aren't you better"

4. upon A's question whether there's hope in management field, Matt replied yes (of course no one in this situation would say no), with two reasons: in america everyone is suing everyone (which is not the reason for hope but cause for mess), and we don't have languages yet. but he said there are people doing that, it's just taking some time https://otter.ai/s/JrAnaEmnQBCFtm2un1AUpg?snpt=true

5. M's comment on the importance of my development (+difficulty of having differnt views) was very consoling https://otter.ai/s/QAXTOeKMSCm_eTEkZYc5hA?snpt=true,  recommended "How to Know a Person" by David Brooks and "Nonviolent Communication" by Marshall Rosenberg.
