### You are a Stan devloper
1. when do you desire to update your statistical model?
- all the time (time is constraint)
2. what are the dimensions of your update?
- add different strauctre (adding covariates - doesn't ; taling to - age, age^2; linear model) - intution and common belief was this
- unit testing - robustness (speed, efficiency)
3. how does modularity between the statistical model and inference contribute to the effectiveness of an update?
4. how does modularity between the statistical model and inference contribute to the efficiency of an update?
5. how do you know when to stop updating?
6. how did you embed this modularity in Stan, in your first year as Stan developer? 
- modularity c; following along with bugs (function - can't have dag specification when you have dag - cyclic); before lbfgs (marcus)
- C++ (stan) - bob and matt (2010, daniel jumped in 2011 - working with Andrew book class - 2012 - prototype was running in 2012) - separation btw statistical  / C++ transplier - cmdstan; 

###  Now, imagine you are a startup CEO.
1. when do you desire to pivot your startup?
- startup activity (vision, starety, implementation) - pivot = vision (bayesian models for pharma -> sell apples) 
- strategy: pkpd -> drug developement (roadmap - )
- strategy is different from 
- head to head (accomplishes the vision - do i outsource )
- vision - strategy - roadmap  (changing pivot is detrimental - topleft to bottom left)
- most tech (prototype - out to market - technical debt - pay down) 
- optimal stopping (to go or not to go)

tech -> flooring companies (alphabet is google's pivot; amazon isn't a pivot - bookseller was a startegy and implementation; todd sauders - luck; ad tech platform; mixed media company; with the same corportate)
- difficult to fold if you have raised fund (have ppl on the cap table - take)
2. what are the dimensions of your pivot?
3. how can modularity between organization, process, product, customer contribute to the effectiveness of pivot? 
4. how can modularity between organization, process, product, customer contribute to the efficiency of pivot? 
5. how can we know when to stop pivoting?


### Sports analytics

20yrs startup (not succeeding) - definition of startup - be disruptive - succeed in a way that is not the same as traditional business

can have a new company that's not a startup (10 years) vs sme (mentality - goal of an SME is to reach a market effectively and earn revenue, whereas a startup aims to disrupt an industry and grow quickly )

in games how do you control the other variables (e.g. players) to measure the effectiveness of specific strategies (e.g. defensive-control vs offensive-execute)?

people want to measure sth and see that's goal (offensive ; entrophy; top is shoots vs dribble,)

when you're modeling - goal is to get to the better model, (stopping process; time to vent doesn't matter)

baseball is unique (moneyball - you have hw (individual hw, team given a score on sum of ))

biometrics (individual - angle of pitcher)
hoka sports driveline
lukebornn idea

market needs - product needs; coach already knew that (model matters - 라브랑 - 마이클 조던 is)
