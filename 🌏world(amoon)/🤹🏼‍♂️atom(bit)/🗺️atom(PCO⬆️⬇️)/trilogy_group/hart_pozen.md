My approach is always initially positive — but a positive approach may then underlie subsequent normative advice. 

Here’s the reason I make this suggestion: If you don't understand how the world currently works, it's very hard to prescribe policies to get the world to function in a new way. 

In my own work, I develop models that characterize some situation in the world using assumptions that are at least at an abstract level behaviorally plausible. 

Doing this allows me to understand the dynamics of the world and allows me to say something about what policy interventions may enhance the outcomes on the dimensions I care about. 

Normative advice without a deep understanding and model of how the world actually works is usually just pontificating — the stuff of self-help books. Of course, I recognize that lots of people will disagree with me on what I've just said.

1. how to implement and evaluate three frames 
2. literature for learn vs earn - why was it surprising to you?

gave 20hr lecture in zurich 

communicate it, so worthwile - no choice but to 

bandit model (sutton; random initial two arms; homogenous; when my belief falls below second (endogensously))

modularize ( simon's watch maker)

condition under which his approach is more useful 

one or two arms (one inside vs outside options)- pull the profits and losses (pull the ); one unit 

pre-entry (post-entry)

abstract (key)

key idea and expands on that - hierarchy 

subelements, first paragraph of the introduction (rest of the introduction is)

search the four paragraph - 

you thought X but I'm Y.
surprise vs novelty

SURPRISE + FACE VALIDITY (buy surprise) + IMPORTANT 

surprise +

explaining heterogeneity

traditional explanation focus on
A. irrationality
B.
C. 

In fact, I show there's simpler explanation; what you've explained in one way can be explained in more fundamental.

e.g. sutton's Sunk Cost and technology (debate on relation between industry concentration and innovation - schumpeter1 (small firms (low concentration; lots of incentives), schumpeter2 (resource to invest) ) -> John Sutton reexamines the traditional agenda. 

nature of industries (technology) is what determined ; all endogenous to one ratio parameter (whole literature on the relationship between concentration and innovation was endogenous to one parameter; underlying one parameter)

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Theme**                | Pre- and post-entry learning connected to decisions under uncertainty              | Decision-making dynamics within founding teams                 | Experimentation and pivoting as strategies for managing uncertainty              |
| **Focus on Entry/Exit**       | Explores excess entry and delayed exit as outcomes of biased and rational learning | Team-based dynamics affecting both entry and exit decisions    | Role of iterative testing and pivoting in overconfident entrepreneurial behavior |
| **Primary Model Used**        | Bayesian computational learning model with bias incorporated                       | Behavioral decision-making framework applied to teams          | Dynamic programming and experimentation-based decision-making                    |
| **Key Contributions**         | Highlights misattributed biases in rational entry/exit decisions                   | Illuminates how team overconfidence impacts survival outcomes  | Expands on pivoting strategies under overconfidence                              |
| **Role of Overconfidence**    | Examines forms of overconfidence (e.g., estimation, precision biases)              | Assesses collective overconfidence in partnerships             | Applies overconfidence to experimentation dynamics                               |
| **Integration of Entry/Exit** | Pre-entry learning shapes post-entry dynamics                                      | Partnerships influence timing and likelihood of entry/exit     | Experiments condition strategic redirection and potential exit                   |

#### Insights into Progression:
1. **Conceptual Depth**:
   - The 2018 paper establishes foundational learning dynamics and integrates Bayesian rationality with biases.
   - The 2022 paper expands the scope to team decision-making, considering partnerships' influence on strategic choices.
   - The 2024 paper shifts to dynamic, iterative processes of pivoting as a practical strategy, incorporating feedback loops for both experimentation and exit optimization.

2. **Model Evolution**:
   - The models progress from individual-focused Bayesian learning to group-focused decision-making frameworks and finally to dynamic programming tailored to entrepreneurial pivots.

3. **Shared Theme Exploration**:
   - Across all three papers, the interplay of learning, bias, and decision-making shapes the trajectory of firms from entry through potential exit. Each paper adds layers of complexity and specificity (e.g., individual to team dynamics, static to dynamic strategies).

- **With replacement** resembles a **flexible learning approach** that keeps the system open to ongoing consumer feedback, helping it adapt over time.
- **Without replacement** resembles a **rigid learning approach** where early preferences dominate, causing the economy to converge on one technology faster, even if it might not be the best long-term choice.
