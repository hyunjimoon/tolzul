- product is attribute (manifested needs - primitive of marketing - consumer pre-exist; safety and shelter)
- product to find to satify needs ; brand to  
- esemble, reversible jump monte carlo (space of monte carlo)
- heuristic (consideration set) then EV (screening - conj, disjunctive)
- interpolation - exchangeability (if cow and car are indistinguishable, then cow and horse aren't as well); company profiles level of factors and feature (conditional on having data)
- archetypical and respond; allows you to aleatoric (describe it, )
- persuasion; convince ppl (existing )

    - Angie Moon and Jeff Dotson discuss the concept of rational meaning construction and its role in entrepreneurship.
        
    - They explore the idea of persuasion in the context of entrepreneurship and the role of investors as collaborators.
        
    - Jeff Dotson emphasizes the importance of understanding the investor's decision-making process rather than changing it.
        
    - They discuss the potential for using large language models to understand and model investor behavior.
        
- **Empirical Results and Future Directions** [1:17:46](https://otter.ai/u/dD7rY4hnyJvKI5fjWWw69uzr25Y?tab=summary&t=4667s)

a) Inability to Model Heterogeneity:

Traditional methods only estimate average effects
Cannot capture firm-specific variations in strategy effectiveness
Bayesian solution: Hierarchical Bayesian models can estimate firm-level effects and distributions

b) Endogeneity Problems:

Current methods (IV, treatment effects) assume uniform effects
Cannot handle cases where managerial skill correlates with outcomes
Bayesian solution: Can model essential heterogeneity through structural models

c) Theory-Method Mismatch:

Standard regression methods can't capture complex theoretical relationships
Path dependency and exchangeability not well modeled
Bayesian solution: Flexible modeling of complex relationships and distributions
