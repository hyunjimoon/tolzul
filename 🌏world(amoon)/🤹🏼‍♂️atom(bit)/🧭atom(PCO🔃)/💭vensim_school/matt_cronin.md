planning for a chat with matt

1. set angie's goal as making one pager with three paragraphs below. 
2. first paragraph
	1. first sentence summarizes what angie and matt has been developing (synthesizing [[üß†üëÅÔ∏èü§úscientist_artist_judge]] with knowledge production chain)
	2. second introduce angie's goal of chat (get feedback on naming for a model that will be presented in complex adaptive system conference paper, collaborating with charlie and evolutionary psychologist). share how this connects with angie's ultimate vision on bridging bayesian and evolutionary entrepreneurship
	3. third explains the future composition: second paragraph explains [[üîÑUTB_understanding-theory-body]] model, third paragraph explains three concrete questions (naming, connection with meehl, open question (impression and rooms for improvement))
3. second paragraph: summarize [[üîÑUTB_understanding-theory-body]]  as if you're explaining this to [[üß†üëÅÔ∏èü§úscientist_artist_judge]] author. 
	1. With [[Cronin_SAJ.pdf]]'s lens, our system dynamics model reveals three foundational pairings that drive innovation through distinct collaborative processes and their products. The Artist-Scientist collaboration (üëÅÔ∏è‚Üíüß†) enables discovery and possibility through testing processes, where imagination of potential truths combines with scientific verification to uncover previously unknown aspects of situations. This process manifests in our model's testing cycle, where perceptive understanding leads to programmatic theory development. The Scientist-Judge pairing (üß†‚Üíü§ú) creates skill and meaning through implementing processes, where scientific understanding of how situations operate combines with judicial evaluation of costs and benefits to enable effective goal achievement. This emerges in our model's implementing cycle from programmatic theory to strategic framework. The Judge-Artist pairing (ü§ú‚ÜíüëÅÔ∏è) generates vision and hope through receiving feedback, where evaluation of current realities combines with imagination of better futures to motivate pursuit of goals despite uncertainty. This manifests in our model's feedback cycle connecting strategic framework back to perceptive understanding. Each pairing produces both an immediate output (discovery, skill, vision) and a deeper foundation (possibility, meaning, hope) that shapes how organizations navigate innovation landscapes.
4. third paragraph: 
	1. Naming: 1) Programmatic vs Integrative Theory, 2) Strategic commitment vs framework (Kuhn), 3) Refine loop, 4) use of the word hypothesis?
	2. connecting with meehl (TH) and understand the feedback loop (epigenetic, intertemporal uncertainty, risk vs uncertainty)



AMR, human connection (lens)

insight beyond that 
goal oriented 

more complicated meaning - (bittersweet)

bureaucracies

two uses of 

passionate 

failure,

exploration and exploitation 

exploitation shows where 

romance is vitality and poison a

romance (yang) and abscence of romance (yin)

crypto - if you have too much of it, it goes away 

as you have more of it, 

romance create optimism that pushes ppl, fails to depression and sadness - need for romance and optism, 

duality - relationship 

min max sup inf = 

brings about sun (yang) and moon (yan)

"opposite" and "bring about" each other
opposite = temporal relationship
bring about = time flows

explore and exploit (both are learning)
two things not 

money brings about poverty ()

constraint as boundary condition (ying-yang is whole)

posterior coupling; 


discovery (pressure change where it goes thought tunnel - mitigate; )

imagination (bird) - vision / skill

SAJ, SJA, 

envison what that is, 

sudoku (end result looks like; how to get there) vs rubics cube (how do you get there)

open field vs stuck problem

need and solution 

goal = sudoku vs honor = rubics

zero sum approach to processs, non-zero sum approach to goal

Utilitarian (end justifies the mean) VS Ontological (mean justifies the end)

respect is zero sum / status

citation; measured 

respect vs status

goal vs process-oriented

Matt: M, Angie: A

1. finally nailed on the "language" to frame machine's role - problem, not the choice itself. e.g. if an entrepreneur was suggested an offer of $7m investment with 20% ownership, what is the meaning of this? i.e. what problem is this? 
- Is "How much money is 20% worth?" the problem?
- Is "How much control do I lose if I don't if I lose 20%" the problem? 
- Is "How much am I limited in the future" the problem?

Each of those problems is simultaneously happening. But human can only think about one (or few) of them i.e. can't play 3D chess.
 
2. Theory and Practice in Research - A criticized Ed Robert's heuristics "ENT scholars shouldn't write about a research question that entrepreneurial practitioners don't know what to do with it" (of course I can infer the context of its origin). In Matt's language, unit theory developer has one's unique role - which Matt agreed. (but one person trying to do everything somehow is burdening: https://otter.ai/s/PBYEaew5SFm3DTEUZmuHcQ?snpt=true.)

3. M resonated with the mess in management field and introduced "holding environment" https://otter.ai/s/7yR98mCaTum-vkyafOIy5Q?snpt=true "we the medical field have a way of getting making it our business to understand and, like, manage the emotions that when you do that, so it's not just you who's trying to deal with it, management doesn't really do that. In fact, management loads it back onto us and says, you know, you have to be better at this. Why aren't you better"

4. upon A's question whether there's hope in management field, Matt replied yes (of course no one in this situation would say no), with two reasons: in america everyone is suing everyone (which is not the reason for hope but cause for mess), and we don't have languages yet. but he said there are people doing that, it's just taking some time https://otter.ai/s/JrAnaEmnQBCFtm2un1AUpg?snpt=true

5. M's comment on the importance of my development (+difficulty of having differnt views) was very consoling https://otter.ai/s/QAXTOeKMSCm_eTEkZYc5hA?snpt=true,  recommended "How to Know a Person" by David Brooks and "Nonviolent Communication" by Marshall Rosenberg.
