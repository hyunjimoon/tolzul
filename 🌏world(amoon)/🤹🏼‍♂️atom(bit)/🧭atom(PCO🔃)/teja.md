analyzing how teja helped me

Given the "non-acceptated" evaluation state my committee informed, analyzing what I have or haven't intended 
1. analyze the cause charlie pointed out- diverse in preparation, background, interest in the problem- communication lab, establish plans. Teja helped me find reasons to restore c
- how is it coming from your perspective, (analyzed - how to clarify when the listeners and I seem to have different meaning of language (e.g. "commercialize my algorithm" -> I want it to be good enough so that people can use)
how can i manage the expectation and delivery of committee members?- regularly share the update- experiment with group / individual mail to check in with committee members -

due date: june 15th (one of your students) 

Introduce yourself - phd working with Charles Fine and Scott Stern on operations for bayesian entrepreneurship

  

Introduce your work - 3 sentences  
Operations research

Good for startups in making decision/pipelines

Case studies

  

I believe that my work is more relevant for Operations management in the Management Science journal. However, the end goal is more related to Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Given this dilemma, I thought an expert like you might proofread my draft and suggest the best subtopic I should aim for in Management Science.

  

Specifically I am looking for these inputs:

- OM or Innov
    
- if neither, how can i improve
    

—

I need some direct advice, confused at times regarding the approach. Can we have actionable goals

- i’ve been more computational (but not formulation as such) how mathematical 
    
- which sections that need math expansion (come back with revised draft)
    

  

ask charlie

 - letter of intent (apply to both in the keywords; intersection of OM and innovation); work heavily ; real time cases for and validate (impact will be huge on innovation (ecosystem); but framework is heavily on OM)

- innovation and OM (angie should take the LEAD)

  
  

ask manuel

- ask for both ok? (both ppl want)

I'll analyze the evaluation transcript to understand the feedback on the STRAP manuscript and extract five key recommendations for improving its acceptance probability in Management Science journal.

Based on my analysis of the evaluation transcript, here are the **five key feedback points** that would improve the manuscript's acceptance probability in Management Science journal:

## 1. **Massive Citation Deficiency - Critical Priority**

The evaluator emphasized this as the most urgent issue: _"have at least 20 to 30 citations only from the introduction"_ and noted citations should be _"mostly in introduction"_ to support all claims. The manuscript currently lacks proper academic grounding, with statements like _"early stage ventures often face critical sequencing decision"_ and _"missteps can be fatal"_ requiring factual citation support. Every specific claim needs backing from authoritative sources.

## 2. **Journal-Specific Terminology and Narrative Alignment**

The evaluator stressed: _"make sure that you use the technical jargon that is appropriate for the journal. Otherwise they'll just say that, okay, this is not our alley."_ Terms like "state variables," "stakeholder buy-in," and "venturing as state transition system" need verification that Management Science readers will understand this language. The narrative structure must match Management Science's expectations rather than engineering paper formats.

## 3. **Validation from Recent Management Science Authors**

Critical recommendation: _"get this draft read by people who published in the management science as soon as possible"_ - specifically PhD students or postdocs who recently published there. The evaluator emphasized this would provide essential feedback on whether _"the terminology, the narrative, the story, is up to the mark"_ and help avoid rejection due to poor journal fit.

## 4. **Enhanced Methodological Rigor and Clarity**

The evaluator noted the need for better explanation of technical concepts. For example, overage/underage costs need immediate definition since _"this audience wouldn't know the concept."_ The paper should include tables (like the suggested C1, C2, C3 causes table) and ensure the methodological progression from deterministic to stochastic to interdependent cases is crystal clear for business school readers.

## 5. **Improved Academic Writing Structure and Flow**

While praising the overall writing quality (_"I really liked the introduction"_), the evaluator suggested adding connecting phrases and transitions (_"Moreover," "On the other hand"_) to improve flow. The paper needs better organization with clear limitations discussion, proper figure/table placement, and adherence to Management Science formatting conventions rather than engineering paper style.

**Bottom Line**: The manuscript has strong conceptual foundations but requires significant academic polish - particularly extensive citation work and validation from recent Management Science authors - before it will be ready for journal submission. The interdisciplinary nature makes journal fit validation especially critical.
