I sympathize with
p.6
- you mentioned "1.Experimental (proactive)" is impractical or infeasible, but this is very usual in entrepreneurship where previous collected data hints the next experiment. I believe ultimate outcome of every model should be an action that triggers data based on which next action is chosen. Incidentally I don't trust any data collected by others (measurement issues) so my preference is experimental > hypothetical > observational
- 
p.7 what's the use of theory
- From Data-Driven Decision Making to Forward-Looking Causal Reasoning
- "Entrepreneurs as Theorists (modelers)" is aligned with my interest, "distinguishes between experiments to test theories within a given problem and experiments that test whether decision makers have chosen the right problem." -> bayesian calibration
- 

p.32
Calculate ratio of posteriors (Bayes factor)

p.58 
dichotomy on data-driven != theory free,

Structural modeling 

I'm most interested in synthesizing below concepts
- hierarchical bayesian model () synthetic population and aggregate forecasting  (DCA)
- sec. 3.4. Theories as Restrictions of the Space of Parameters

EV ′ � V, the negative update of V cannot be much smaller. The extra information provided by the experiment is then limited because the ratio of V to Q will not change much.

bootstrap testing
- "Similar issues arise with the bootstrap, another class of procedures that uses simulation to correct for inferential biases"
