| D: market dynamics                                              | The more dynamic market (low S) is, the less it updates its belief about market acceptance, hence longer it takes to pivot the market.                                                    | An EV startup operating in a highly dynamic market with rapidly evolving customer preferences and competitor moves may take longer to pivot, as the changing conditions make it harder to draw firm conclusions about market fit.                          |
| O: Optimism                                                     | The more optimistic a startup is about market acceptance, the less it updates its belief about market, hence longer it takes to pivot the market.                                         | An EV startup that is highly optimistic about the market potential for a new battery technology may continue pursuing it longer before considering a pivot, as the positive outlook reduces the perceived need to update beliefs based on market feedback. |
| U: Uncertainty on market acceptance over production feasibility | The more confident a startup is about the market acceptance (compared to production feasibility), the less it updates its belief about market, hence longer it takes to pivot the market. | An EV startup highly confident in the demand for a specific battery chemistry may stick with it longer before considering pivoting to a different technology or market segment.                                                                            |
| E: Experiment opportunity                                       | The more experiment opportunity a startup has, the more scientific experiments can be done (e.g., in parallel), hence it can pivot to a more precise market, if needed.                   | An EV startup with ample resources to conduct multiple market validation tests simultaneously can more quickly zero in on the most promising segments and pivot accordingly.                                                                               |
| R: Risk-cash tolerance                                          | The more risk endurance a startup has, the more scientific experiments can be done (e.g., in parallel), hence it can pivot to a more precise market, if needed.                           | An EV startup with high risk tolerance can conduct bolder experiments testing novel battery chemistries and market applications, enabling a more informed and targeted pivot if required.                                                                  |

chatted on [[2024May]]

The key updates based on the conversation include:

1. Distinguishing between expansion and pivoting in the Optimism and Risk-Cash Tolerance sections.
2. Refining the Uncertainty Ratio section to compare market vs. product uncertainty.
3. Updating the Experiment Opportunity section to reflect expanding market vs. iterating product based on available resources.
4. Adding more relevant examples from the EV and AV industry to illustrate each hypothesis.
