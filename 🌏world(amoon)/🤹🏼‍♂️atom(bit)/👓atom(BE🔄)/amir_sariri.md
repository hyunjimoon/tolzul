Abstract: Multi-state Markov Model for Startup Activity Sequencing using CDL Longitudinal Data

Startup development is a complex process involving a sequence of activities, such as analysis, experimentation, implementation, and resource acquisition. Understanding the patterns and factors influencing the prioritization of these activities can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs and mentors. Inspired by the multi-state Markov model for inferring latent deterioration processes in naval ship engine failure data (Moon et al., 2022), we propose a novel approach to model startup activity sequencing using longitudinal data from the Startup Genome's Creative destruction labs (CDL) program.

Our study aims to develop a descriptive model of startup activity sequencing and investigate the impact of environmental factors, such as the level of technology (high-tech vs. low-tech), on the transition probabilities between different activity states. We categorize startup activities into four main states: analysis (A), experimentation (E), implementation (I), and resource acquisition (R). Using a hidden Markov model (HMM), we estimate the transition probabilities between these states based on the observed activity sequences of startups in the CDL program.

To account for the latent effects of environmental factors and the inherent uncertainty in startup development, we employ a Bayesian approach for parameter estimation. By separating the learning and doing phases, our model aims to capture the trade-offs between prioritizing learning activities (e.g., analysis and experimentation) and implementation activities. We hypothesize that high-tech startups, particularly those in deep tech domains, may require more learning activities before transitioning to implementation compared to low-tech startups.

The CDL longitudinal data, collected at two-month intervals, provides a rich source of information on early-stage startup activities and their associated business objectives. We apply a majority rule to categorize startup activities into the four main states (A, E, I, R) based on the dominant activity type observed within each time interval. By modeling the transitions between these states using an HMM, we aim to uncover common activity sequencing patterns and their relationship to startup success, as measured by access to capital.

Our research contributes to the literature on entrepreneurial learning and decision-making by providing a data-driven, quantitative approach to understanding startup activity sequencing. The insights gained from this study can inform entrepreneurial education, mentorship programs, and resource allocation strategies for early-stage startups. Furthermore, our methodology demonstrates the potential for adapting multi-state Markov models from reliability engineering to the domain of entrepreneurship research.
