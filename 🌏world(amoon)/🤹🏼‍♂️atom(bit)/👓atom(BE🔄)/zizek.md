The key difference from [[steve_pinker]]'s approach is that while Pinker seeks empirical evidence for progress and rational solutions, ≈Ωi≈æek focuses on contradictions, antagonisms, and the unconscious forces that structure social reality. Where Pinker sees rational progress, ≈Ωi≈æek sees productive failures and ruptures that reveal deeper truths.
