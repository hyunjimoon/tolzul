| Metric Category     | Current Usage                                   | Issues Identified                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Range               | Most prominent metric, displayed front & center | - Overestimates actual needs (95% of trips are <30 miles)<br>- Variable based on conditions (weather, driving behavior)<br>- Promotes larger batteries which waste resources                                     |
| Acceleration (0-60) | Second most common                              | - Not practically useful for public road driving<br>- EVs already fast enough for normal use<br>- May encourage unnecessary performance focus                                                                    |
| Charging Time       | Third most common                               | - Inconsistent measurement methods (15min vs 20min vs 10-80%)<br>- Hard to make direct comparisons<br>- Important but needs standardization                                                                      |
| Efficiency (MPGe)   | Rarely shown                                    | - Critical for long-term EV market success<br>- Required on window stickers but absent from marketing<br>- Could help counter "car bloat"                                                                        |
| key message         |                                                 | focus more on metrics that promote EV market sustainability (efficiency) <br>rather than ones that may drive unnecessary battery size increases <br>or performance capabilities beyond what's practically useful |
