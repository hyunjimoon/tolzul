to understand [[🐸Breast Stroke Model of Innovation]] better


### Table 1: When to Choose Breaststroke 🤔

| Condition               | Choose Breaststroke When...      | Alternative When...            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Water Visibility** 👀 | Murky/cloudy water               | Clear water → Freestyle        |
| **Energy Level** 🔋     | Tired/need to conserve energy    | Fresh/energetic → Freestyle    |
| **Water Surface** 🌊    | Rough waves, need stability      | Calm water → Any stroke        |
| **Navigation** 🗺️      | Need to spot direction/landmarks | Known route → Freestyle        |
| **Depth** 🪨            | Shallow/obstacle-filled water    | Deep, clear water → Any stroke |
| **Purpose** 🎯          | Rescue/watching others           | Racing/speed → Freestyle       |

To enhance understanding, consider creating a visual diagram:

- **Breaststroke Phases Diagram**:
  - **Illustrate each phase** with a swimmer, highlighting arm and leg movements.
  - **Annotate the arms** with marketing actions and the legs with operations actions.
  - **Include icons/emojis** to represent key concepts (e.g., 🔍 for exploration, 💥 for execution, 🌊 for sustaining momentum).
