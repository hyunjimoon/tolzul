define functions I'd like to adopt. this helps detecting people with this function so that i can learn to transplant in my body.

After defining my life goal with five functions,  interacting with amazing people ([[🤹‍♀️atom(bit)]]) in allowed me to set object as [[🌏world(amoon)/🤹🏼‍♂️atom(bit)/🌙human(tolzul)]], [[🗺️educate(ops4innov)]], [[👓synthesize(ops4innov)]], [[🧭navigate(startup)]]. [[def(walkie-talkie)]] is my ritual to exchange bits and atoms with the [[🤹‍♀️atom(bit)]] I feel attached to.

- 2024 summer, i'm delving into: how to detect people who has absorptive capacity? (JB>Charlie>Matt>Josh>Scott)
----

E: PCS-[A: BES -> S: BEF]-> T: PCF
educator + archivist2synthesizer = transporter

- a person is an atomized bit, modularized thoughts that are mostly consistent 
- I decipher signals (e.g. writings and voice) to learn their bit/soul
- based on the following label of person's function into one of the four quadrants
- each person I label people's function into one of the four quadrants

how bits and atoms differ especially in their management?
