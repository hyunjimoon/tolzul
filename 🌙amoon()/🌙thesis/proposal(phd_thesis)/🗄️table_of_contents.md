I asked [gpt](https://chatgpt.com/share/6821ecc6-6804-8002-b46c-4f094f7a6e4d) how the structure below helped me organized [[Moon25_propose(thesis).pdf]] i.e. projecting from 1million dimension to 10pg :) 

The reorganization of Section 2 transformed a fragmented treatment of stakeholders into a unified decision-making core, which in turn enabled the STRAP framework to emerge in the thesis. Originally, Section 2’s “Multi-Stakeholder Decision Matrices” was refocused to explicitly incorporate stakeholder thresholds and a dual optimization perspective. This clarity bridged the gap between Section 1’s perceptual modeling (how an entrepreneur **perceives** uncertainties) and Section 3’s action sequencing (how an entrepreneur **acts** on uncertainties). In practice, the revised Section 2 provided the logical glue: it formalized how reducing uncertainty and satisfying stakeholders can be balanced in one **Bayesian** decision rule. This logical integration allowed the disparate ideas to synthesize into **STRAP (Strategic Threshold Resolution for Actionable Priorities)** – a coherent perceive-act cycle. Thus, by restructuring Section 2, the thesis could formalize STRAP’s theorize–produce–evaluate process, unifying operational omissions, stakeholder coordination, and decision metrics into the actionable framework presented in the PDF.

Using material startups as a running case, we model decision-making as minimizing residual uncertainty UC(a)/C(a), subject to deterministic state transitions D<sub>a</sub>(A<sub>e</sub>,S<sub>e</sub>)=S'<sub>e</sub>. The framework decomposes uncertainty per cost into three estimable components: uncertainty per state (B), state transitions per action (D), and action cost (C). By applying LP formulation to bottleneck identification, entrepreneurs can make tractable myopic decisions rather than solving intractable sequential optimization. Case studies demonstrate how this guides phase-wise execution and accelerates operational learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ![[Pasted image 20250501154052.png\|200]]                                                                                                                                   | WU/A <br>focus on #segment, #collaborate <br><br>- [[📝⛰️scale_seg_collab]]<br>[[💜🟩seg_collab]]<br><br>uncertainty per cost _(w × U)_= uncertainty per state _(B)_× state per action _(D)_× action per cost _(C)_ | 60  |

Using the dynamic transition model D'<sub>e</sub>(S'<sub>e</sub>,A'<sub>e</sub>)=S'<sub>e</sub><sup>t+1</sup>, we show how strategic experimentation triggers cross-stakeholder spillovers. Stakeholder preferences are abstracted as binary accept/reject responses, enabling simultaneous testing rather than sequential negotiation. The framework minimizes residual weighted uncertainty WBS'<sub>e</sub>/C(A'<sub>e</sub>), where the entrepreneur acts as central coordinator selecting actions that create positive network effects. Platform design applications demonstrate how this approach breaks circular dependencies and accelerates coordinated commitments.Stakeholder responses are modeled as binary latent variables over a hypothesis space structured by the transition matrix _(D)_ and utility projections _(U)_. By contrasting this with causal-inference-based reasoning, we reveal how entrepreneurs can simulate stakeholder acceptance via test quantities and resolve preference entanglements through integer-based reasoning. We introduce tools for visualizing model structure and apply our framework to platform design and product feature allocation decisions in early-stage ventures. | ![[Pasted image 20250501154149.png\|200]]<br><br><br>![[🗄️table_of_contents 2025-04-29-8.svg\|200]]<br>%%[[🗄️table_of_contents 2025-04-29-8.md\|🖋 Edit in Excalidraw]]%% | B<br><br>uncertainty per state (different interpretation between different stakeholder)                                                                                                                             | 60  |

This federated learning mechanism enables bi-directional updates: entrepreneurs' experiences refine institutional models while aggregated patterns provide better priors for new ventures.
