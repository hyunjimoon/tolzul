Entrepreneurial decision-making today often feels like being handed the wrong tools for the journey. Imagine navigating with a compass that only points north, a map drawn for someone else’s terrain, or a desert survival guide while you’re actually in a jungle. Much of the advice entrepreneurs receive—however well-intentioned—resembles these misfit guides. It offers a single direction (e.g. _maximize profit at all costs_), a borrowed map, or context-blind tips that can lead founders astray in their own unique venture terrain.

These aren’t just colorful metaphors – they echo real situations observed across diverse innovation ecosystems. In discussions with dozens of stakeholders (entrepreneurs from different culture, vision, capability, investors (Engie, Flagship Pioneering, Entegris, Bass, Sazze, 500 Global), educators from universities MIT (U.S.), HPI (Germany), A*STAR (Singapore), SNU (Korea) investors), I found case after case of guidance failing when it ignored context. For instance, MIT’s Technology Licensing Office often urges patenting as a default strategy – a great north star in biotech, but a false lead for climate-tech ventures that thrive on open collaboration. Similarly, the now-canonical **customer-centered** playbook works brilliantly for consumer apps, yet I saw it misfire in domains like advanced cancer diagnostics where demand is assured and technical validation is the real hurdle. I heard of founders from wealthy families who skipped the frantic early fundraising that standard advice assumes – with personal capital or patient backers, their priorities lay in product and partnership, not pitching every quarter. Even team-building norms varied wildly: Silicon Valley’s “**hire fast, fire fast**” mantra falls flat in East Asian contexts that prize loyalty and gradual growth. And within the U.S., East Coast startup hubs often follow a tight-knit “village” model of mentorship, unlike the West Coast “valley” ethos of blitzscaling. Finally, when the macroeconomic climate shifts into a downturn, yesterday’s winning playbook can become today’s wrong map – underscoring that any guidance must adapt to new terrain or risk leading entrepreneurs off course.

All these cases point to the need for a fundamentally different approach to guiding entrepreneurial decisions. Instead of relying on a static map and a one-dimensional compass, entrepreneurs need the equivalent of a **GPS that dynamically combines sensor and motion** – in other words, a navigation system that adapts in real time to the founder’s perspective and surroundings. Concretely, I identify three core needs at the heart of such an adaptive system: 📽️ **Perception** – the ability to clearly sense and interpret how different stakeholders view the venture; 🔄 **Coordination** – the capacity to align and synergize these stakeholders’ actions and expectations; and ⚡ **Sequencing** – the foresight to take the right steps in the right order under resource constraints. These three needs form the backbone of our framework. In the following **Need Analysis** and **Solution Design** sections, I delve into each need and show how a rigorous decision model can function as that adaptive entrepreneurial GPS, dynamically guiding founders through ever-changing terrain with evidence-based clarity and precision.

I apply this framework first to the mobility sector because it naturally activates all three pillars: perception, coordination, and sequencing. Mobility ventures require complex, multi-stakeholder alignment across regulators, infrastructure partners, and technology providers—making them ideal for testing coordination strategies under real-world constraints. Their moderate clockspeed—slower than software but faster than heavy industry—grants entrepreneurs time to strategically sequence experiments without being overtaken by market shifts. The sector’s remarkable breadth, from batteries and micromobility to aviation and public transit, allows us to validate generalizability across heterogeneous contexts. Crucially, mobility sits at the intersection of AI, robotics, and climate tech—fast-evolving, signal-rich domains that challenge our ability to model stakeholder perception under uncertainty. These qualities make mobility ventures not just an appropriate case, but a high-leverage proving ground for adaptive, evidence-based decision support.
