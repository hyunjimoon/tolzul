## 5. Conclusion
This research establishes stakeholder sequencing as a fundamental theoretical domain within entrepreneurial decision-making, demonstrating how systematic uncertainty optimization can resolve longstanding tensions between resource development and market validation strategies. By synthesizing inventory optimization theory with multi-stakeholder venture dynamics, STRAP transcends the artificial dichotomy between "capability-first" and "customer-first" approaches that has constrained entrepreneurship theory for decades. Our framework reveals two counterintuitive effects—the Probability Effect and Interdependence Effect—that systematically contradict conventional wisdom, showing when entrepreneurs should pursue lower-probability stakeholders or higher-cost engagements to optimize expected outcomes.

The theoretical implications extend far beyond stakeholder management into the foundations of entrepreneurial cognition and strategic decision-making under uncertainty. Our transition from belief-state modeling toward bounded optimality approaches addresses fundamental limitations in current Bayesian entrepreneurship frameworks, suggesting that entrepreneurs' systematic deviations from rational behavior reflect computational constraints rather than cognitive failures. This reconceptualization opens new research territories connecting operations research, behavioral economics, and entrepreneurship theory through computational frameworks that preserve analytical rigor while acknowledging practical decision-making realities.

The institutional implications of our findings suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystem development requires systematic information infrastructure comparable to capital market institutions in supporting venture success. By demonstrating how cost parameter transparency and stakeholder behavior prediction can be operationalized through institutional intermediaries, this research provides a blueprint for evidence-based entrepreneurship policy that moves beyond generic advice toward context-specific, quantitatively-informed decision support. The framework's capacity to transform complex multi-stakeholder uncertainty into actionable decision rules represents a fundamental advance in translating theoretical insights into practical entrepreneurial capabilities, establishing new standards for systematic venture development in high-uncertainty environments.
