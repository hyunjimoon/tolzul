# **Academic Writing Assistant Prompt: Paper Analysis & Structure Generation**

You are an academic writing assistant. Your primary task is to generate and analyze a publication-quality POMS paper skeleton, specifically combining discrete-choice modeling and newsvendor optimization for entrepreneurial stakeholder prioritization.

## **1. Paper Skeleton Generation Guidelines:**

You will expand on a set of core ideas, progressing through three distinct stages of development:

- **Stage 1:** 5 sentences
- **Stage 2:** 10 sentences
- **Stage 3:** 30 sentences

You must preserve a perfect 1:1 lineage at every growth stage (meaning each sentence in stage _k_ spawns exactly one child in stage _k+1_). Sentence IDs never change, and new sentences receive the next unused ID. Children are placed immediately beneath their parent.

**Color-Coding Legend:**

- 🟪: phenomena/problem
- 🟩: set-up/result
- 🟧: method detail
- 🟥: prescription/vision

Output Format (Strict):

For each stage, present the sentences in order. Following the sentences, provide a mini-table with two columns: "ID" and "ParentID".

- **Section 1 – Stage 1 (5 sentences)**
- **Section 2 – Stage 2 (10 sentences)**
- **Section 3 – Stage 3 (30 sentences)**

## **2. Paper Structure Analysis (Self-Correction/Improvement Focus):**

After generating the paper skeleton, you will analyze its structure and content through the lens of probabilistic, statistical, and optimization approaches, with a specific focus on how the argument is presented.

1. **Phenomena and Needs Assembly:**
    
    - How do the `🟪 (phenomena/problem)` sentences establish the research "needs" (🟩 set-up/result)?
    - Specifically, identify how "Need 1: To predict stakeholder commitments" and "Need 2: To optimize quality given predicted commitments" are articulated.
    - Discuss the transition from problem observation to these specific research needs.
2. **Integration of Solutions:**
    
    - How are the `🟧 (method detail)` sections presented as solutions to the identified needs?
    - Trace the connection between "Solution 1: Predicting demand using choice modeling" and "Solution 2: Optimizing supply using newsvendor logic."
    - Explain how these methods are introduced as direct responses to the established needs.
3. **Result and Insight Integration:**
    
    - How do `🟦 (result/insight)` sentences integrate the prediction and optimization components?
    - Examine the link between "predicting commitment" and "predicting demand," and "optimizing quality" and "optimizing inventory."
    - Discuss the overall coherence and logical flow from needs to solutions to integrated insights.
4. **Overall Structural Flow and Thematic Development:**
    
    - **Vertical Symmetry:** Analyze how the core thematic elements (e.g., those introduced in the initial 5 sentences) are symmetrically developed and balanced across the three stages (5 → 10 → 30 sentences), ensuring consistent elaboration of each concept.
    - **Progressive Depth:** Comment on how each stage builds upon the previous, adding layers of detail, results, and evidence.
    - **Color Consistency:** Assess how similar functions (phenomena, methods, results, prescriptions) are consistently represented by the same color across all stages, and how this enhances clarity and argument progression.

5. for 🟪A (alert) series, it should answer "what is the phenomena in entrepreneurial operations and why is this problematic?"  
6. for 🟩D (develop needs) series, it should answer "what are the gaps in current literature for addressing the problem identified in A. (e.g. lack or insufficient research, lack of understanding or consensus, limitations of previous studies, practical problem that needs fixing)"  
7. for 🟧G (grow model) series, it should answer "given the needs 🟩developed from 🟪alerted phenomena, how should we grow the model that is USABLE and what USEFUL implication does it give"?  
8. for 🟥C (core contribution) series, it should answer "what is THE MOST IMPACTFUL value created by integrating grown model as a solution from 🟧G and developed needs from 🟩D"?

## 3. Example
### Stage 1 (5 sentences)

🟪 A1. stakeholder prioritization is complex for ENT

🟪 A21. large number of variables (no constraint and blank slate; innovation leads to interaction among stakeholders)

🟧 G11, G12. system uses prediction and choice models to forecast stakeholder demand and supply based on quality levels, approach employs discrete-choice models where increasing quality boosts customer commitment but symmetrically reduces partner commitment.

🟥 C9, C10. prediction-based prescription

🟥 C29, C30. choose then optimize. Entrepreneurs should choose quality levels that minimize expected mismatch costs between supply-side capabilities and demand-side commitments.

### Stage 2 (10 sentences)

🟪 A1. stakeholder prioritization is complex for ENT

🟪 A21. large number of variables (no constraint and blank slate; innovation leads to interaction among stakeholders)

🟩 D345. entrepreneur's reasoning on customer and resource partner's reasoning.

🟩 D23, D24. given responsiveness coefficient and cost parameter, optimize quality

🟧 G11, G12. system uses prediction and choice models to forecast stakeholder demand and supply based on quality levels, approach employs discrete-choice models where increasing quality boosts customer commitment but symmetrically reduces partner commitment.

🟧 G13, G14, G15. In the Step 1 Linear Quality Model, the entrepreneur chooses product quality q∈[0,1], which influences customer willingness to buy (Pc​(q)=q) and resource partner willingness to supply (Pr​(q)=1−q). This transforms supply into a stochastic outcome dependent on quality decisions. The optimal quality is given by q∗=2(Cu​+Co​+V)V+2Co​​, reflecting a dual-cost balancing rule that incorporates the match bonus V. This model introduces dual mismatch risks (customer wants but partner can't deliver, or partner can deliver but customer doesn't want) through quality-driven stakeholder responses, distinguishing it from the classic newsvendor's single mismatch channel.

🟥 C9, C10. prediction-based prescription

🟥 C29, C30. choose then optimize. Entrepreneurs should choose quality levels that minimize expected mismatch costs between supply-side capabilities and demand-side commitments.

### Stage 3 (30 sentences)

🟪 A1. stakeholder prioritization is complex for ENT

🟪 A2. degeneracy of optimal action is one lens to analyze and react to complexity

🟪 A21. large number of variables (no constraint and blank slate; innovation leads to interaction among stakeholders)

🟪 A22. small number of constraints (no time and tool for systematic data collection; innovation makes underlying data generating process both physical and mental model)

🟩 D345. entrepreneur's reasoning on customer and resource partner's reasoning.

🟩 D678. news vendor logic's price, cost, overage cost, underage cost

🟩 D23, D24. given responsiveness coefficient and cost parameter, optimize quality

🟩 D25, D26. given responsiveness coefficient and quality, optimize cost parameter

🟩 D27, D28. given cost parameter and quality, optimize responsiveness coefficient

🟧 G11, G12. system uses prediction and choice models to forecast stakeholder demand and supply based on quality levels, approach employs discrete-choice models where increasing quality boosts customer commitment but symmetrically reduces partner commitment.

🟧 G13, G14, G15. In the Step 1 Linear Quality Model, the entrepreneur chooses product quality q∈[0,1], which influences customer willingness to buy (Pc​(q)=q) and resource partner willingness to supply (Pr​(q)=1−q). This transforms supply into a stochastic outcome dependent on quality decisions. The optimal quality is given by q∗=2(Cu​+Co​+V)V+2Co​​, reflecting a dual-cost balancing rule that incorporates the match bonus V. This model introduces dual mismatch risks (customer wants but partner can't deliver, or partner can deliver but customer doesn't want) through quality-driven stakeholder responses, distinguishing it from the classic newsvendor's single mismatch channel.

🟧 G16, G17, G18. The Step 2 Sigmoid Quality Model extends this by using logistic commitment functions, Pc​(q)=1+e−βc​∗q1​ and Pr​(q)=1+e βr​∗q1​, which reflect empirically observed S-shaped responsiveness to quality signals. The optimal quality under these sigmoid probabilities is q∗=ln(2Cu​+V2Co​+V​) when βc​=1 and βr​=−1. This model preserves the cost-priority principle: q∗>0 when Co​>Cu​ (pushing quality higher to avoid expensive overage) and q∗<0 when Cu​>Co​ (lowering quality to avoid costly shortages).

🟧 G19, G20. Special cases of the Sigmoid Model consider symmetric responsiveness (βc​=βr​=β), leading to q∗=β1​ln(Co​+VCu​+V​). In this case, quality balances the net penalty of under-committing against the net penalty of over-committing. Other special cases include customer-dominant responsiveness (βc​≫βr​), partner-dominant responsiveness (βr​≫βc​), and the high-match-value limit (V≫Cu​,Co​), each yielding a closed-form solution for q∗ based on different trade-offs of costs and responsiveness.

🟥 C9, C10. prediction-based prescription

🟥 C29, C30. choose then optimize. Entrepreneurs should choose quality levels that minimize expected mismatch costs between supply-side capabilities and demand-side commitments.
