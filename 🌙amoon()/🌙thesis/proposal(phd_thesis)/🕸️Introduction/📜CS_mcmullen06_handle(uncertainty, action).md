### Abstract

Entrepreneurial action refers to “behavior in response to a judgmental decision under uncertainty about a possible opportunity for profit” (McMullen and Shepherd, 2006, p. 134). This view tends to conceive of entrepreneurs as change agents who catalyze the economy. Although motivated by self-interest, entrepreneurial action is only rewarded to the extent that it creates a perceived contribution over existing solutions to current problems. Therefore, to become an entrepreneur, individuals must escape ignorance – discover, create, or imagine a solution that could be, but currently is not – and overcome uncertainty (doubt) that can delay or prevent them from introducing their innovation to the market. This involves assessments of a situation as both a third-person opportunity – belief that a situation is an opportunity for someone – and a first-person opportunity assessment – belief that a situation is an opportunity for the entrepreneur. For entrepreneurial action to occur, the individual must believe that a situation represents a first-person opportunity. Profit is often validation of the veracity of this belief. The defining characteristic of the entrepreneurial action approach, therefore, is new value creation and the institutional change that it creates as a consequence of its occurrence.

**Why Selected**: This paper directly tackles the normative-positive divide by:

- **Normative side**: Prescribing how entrepreneurs should process uncertainty and make rational decisions
- **Positive side**: Recognizing that entrepreneurs actually make decisions under "uncertainty" rather than "risk" (unmeasurable vs. measurable)

**Relevance**: They argue that traditional economic models (normative) assume entrepreneurs should make decisions with known probabilities, while actual entrepreneurial behavior (positive) involves acting despite unknowable probabilities. Your stakeholder acceptance states bridge this gap by providing measurable variables even when underlying probabilities remain uncertain.
