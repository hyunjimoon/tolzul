**Abstract: Entrepreneurial Decision Model with Phase-Based Operational Uncertainty Reduction**

This thesis develops an operational framework for entrepreneurial decision-making that minimizes uncertainty rather than maximizing utility. We introduce a structured approach to sequence critical operational actions (Collaborate, Segment, Capitalize) based on their uncertainty reduction efficiency across venture development phases. Using state transition modeling, we demonstrate how different action sequences create distinct uncertainty reduction paths, allowing entrepreneurs to optimize resource allocation. Our model integrates operations management principles with discrete choice modeling to create actionable decision tools that adapt to different venture phases. Case studies in mobility ventures validate our approach, showing how entrepreneurs can systematically reduce operational uncertainties while respecting resource constraints. This work bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation, providing entrepreneurs with structured methods to navigate complex decision environments.

**Abstract: Bayesian Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Under Multi-Stakeholder Uncertainty**

This thesis develops a Bayesian approach to entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on how entrepreneurs can systematically reduce demand-side uncertainty through strategic action sequencing. We formulate entrepreneurial decisions as uncertainty minimization problems where stakeholder preferences and initial venture states determine optimal action paths. The model accounts for how different actions (Collaborate, Segment, Capitalize) affect stakeholder uncertainties and demonstrates that market-focused actions early in the venture lifecycle can dramatically improve efficiency. Our empirical analysis of mobility ventures validates the model's predictive power for understanding entrepreneurial choices and outcomes. This work contributes to entrepreneurship theory by providing a mathematically rigorous framework for analyzing the previously tacit knowledge of uncertainty reduction, while offering practical guidance for entrepreneurs navigating complex market environments.

## 3. Technical Implementation Focus (for Vikash Mansinghka)

**Abstract: Probabilistic Programming for Entrepreneurial Decision Support Under Uncertainty**

This thesis develops a probabilistic programming approach to entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty. We formulate entrepreneurial choices as sequential decisions aimed at minimizing weighted uncertainties across demand, supply, and investor dimensions. Our model leverages advanced probabilistic programming techniques to represent the state transition dynamics between different uncertainty states based on entrepreneurial actions. We demonstrate how this approach enables entrepreneurs to reason systematically about complex decision spaces, accounting for resource constraints and stakeholder preferences. Implementation using probabilistic programming allows for efficient simulation of alternative action sequences and their uncertainty reduction effects. Case studies in mobility ventures showcase how different initial conditions and preference weights lead to distinct optimal action sequences. This work bridges theoretical entrepreneurship models with computational decision support tools, providing a foundation for AI-assisted entrepreneurial decision-making.
