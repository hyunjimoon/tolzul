## Abstract

Early-stage entrepreneurs must make high-stakes decisions under extreme uncertainty, yet conventional startup playbooks offer little guidance tailored to a venture’s specific context. Founders are typically advised to imitate success cases or follow one-size-fits-all growth strategies, approaches that are **not personalized** to their unique initial conditions and **not actionable** in guiding day-to-day choices. This thesis addresses those gaps by proposing a decision-making framework that reimagines entrepreneurial strategy as an iterative **Perception → Action → Confirmation** cycle. In our model, the startup maintains a personalized uncertainty state $S_0 = [U_d, U_s, U_i]$ capturing its knowledge gaps with respect to key stakeholders (e.g. **demand**, **supply**, and **investor** uncertainties) and a weight vector $W$ reflecting the relative importance of each domain to the venture’s success. At each step, the entrepreneur selects an action (experiment, milestone, or investment) aimed at reducing uncertainty in one of these dimensions. I derive a tractable policy – the **STRAP** rule – that prescribes the optimal next action by quantitatively balancing expected uncertainty reduction against resource cost. In essence, the STRAP rule prioritizes the “bottleneck” stakeholder concern offering the highest uncertainty-reduction per unit cost. This decision rule emerges from a novel **primal-dual optimization** formulation: the venture’s problem is cast as minimizing total weighted uncertainty subject to resource constraints (primal), while its dual interprets the same process as **maximizing the overall success probability** (likelihood of satisfying all stakeholders). The primal-dual analysis not only yields an interpretable threshold condition for action selection – equating an action’s marginal information gain to the opportunity cost of resources (via Lagrange multipliers $\lambda$, $\gamma$) – but also provides a built-in convergence diagnostic by tracking the gap between the uncertainty-based objective and its dual (success probability).

Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. **Analytically,** STRAP is proven to adapt its recommendations to each venture’s initial state and priorities: different starting uncertainty profiles $S_0$ and weight settings $W$ yield appropriately different action paths, satisfying a key personalization criterion. The policy inherently targets information-efficient experiments (those that _break the biggest uncertainty bottlenecks first_), which I show minimizes the total “area under the uncertainty–investment curve” – a measure of learning efficiency. Moreover, by comparing the primal and dual objective values over time, entrepreneurs can assess when they have sufficiently reduced uncertainty (i.e. when additional actions would no longer significantly raise overall success likelihood). **Empirically,** I validate STRAP through simulation and case studies. Simulated startups following the STRAP strategy achieve higher success probabilities with lower resource expenditure compared to those following generic sequencing heuristics. In qualitative case studies, the framework retrospectively explains the divergent outcomes of real ventures: for example, **Segway** famously over-invested in technical perfection while misjudging market demand, whereas **Sublime Systems** pursued a staged approach aligning product development with early customer validation. Our framework captures these differences – Segway’s failure to address its biggest uncertainty (true market acceptance) versus Sublime’s balanced uncertainty reduction – and illustrates how a lack of stakeholder coordination can create a confirmation bottleneck. Overall, this research offers entrepreneurs an **evidence-based, mathematically rigorous yet practically tractable** approach to navigate uncertainty. It enables founders to systematically test their venture’s critical assumptions, align diverse stakeholder expectations, and optimally allocate scarce resources in a sequential manner, ultimately reimagining entrepreneurial decision-making as a data-informed, adaptive learning process rather than a static playbook.
## 1. 🏳️‍🌈Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Reimagined

Entrepreneurial decision-making today often feels like being handed the wrong tools for the journey. Imagine navigating with a compass that only points north, a map drawn for someone else’s terrain, or a desert survival guide while you’re actually in a jungle. Much of the advice entrepreneurs receive—however well-intentioned—resembles these misfit guides. It offers a single direction (e.g. _maximize profit at all costs_), a borrowed map, or context-blind tips that can lead founders astray in their own unique venture terrain.

These aren’t just colorful metaphors – they echo real situations observed across diverse innovation ecosystems. In discussions with dozens of stakeholders (entrepreneurs from different culture, vision, capability, investors (Engie, Flagship Pioneering, Entegris, Bass, Sazze, 500 Global), educators from universities MIT (U.S.), HPI (Germany), A*STAR (Singapore), SNU (Korea) investors), I found case after case of guidance failing when it ignored context. For instance, MIT’s Technology Licensing Office often urges patenting as a default strategy – a great north star in biotech, but a false lead for climate-tech ventures that thrive on open collaboration. Similarly, the now-canonical **customer-centered** playbook works brilliantly for consumer apps, yet I saw it misfire in domains like advanced cancer diagnostics where demand is assured and technical validation is the real hurdle. I heard of founders from wealthy families who skipped the frantic early fundraising that standard advice assumes – with personal capital or patient backers, their priorities lay in product and partnership, not pitching every quarter. Even team-building norms varied wildly: Silicon Valley’s “**hire fast, fire fast**” mantra falls flat in East Asian contexts that prize loyalty and gradual growth. And within the U.S., East Coast startup hubs often follow a tight-knit “village” model of mentorship, unlike the West Coast “valley” ethos of blitzscaling. Finally, when the macroeconomic climate shifts into a downturn, yesterday’s winning playbook can become today’s wrong map – underscoring that any guidance must adapt to new terrain or risk leading entrepreneurs off course.

All these cases point to the need for a fundamentally different approach to guiding entrepreneurial decisions. Instead of relying on a static map and a one-dimensional compass, entrepreneurs need the equivalent of a **GPS that dynamically combines sensor and motion** – in other words, a navigation system that adapts in real time to the founder’s perspective and surroundings. Concretely, I identify three core needs at the heart of such an adaptive system: 📽️ **Perception** – the ability to clearly sense and interpret how different stakeholders view the venture; ⚡ **Sequencing** – the foresight to take the right steps in the right order under resource constraints; and 🔄 **Confirmation** – the capacity to align and synergize these stakeholders’ actions and expectations. These three needs form the backbone of my framework. In the following **Need Analysis** and **Solution Design** sections, I delve into each need and show how a rigorous decision model can function as that adaptive entrepreneurial GPS, dynamically guiding founders through ever-changing terrain. I call this 🪢STRAP (Sequential Threshold Reduction for Actionable Perceptions) framework.

I apply this framework first to the mobility sector because it naturally activates all three pillars: perception, sequencing, and Confirmation. Mobility ventures require complex, multi-stakeholder alignment across regulators, infrastructure partners, and technology providers—making them ideal for testing Confirmation strategies under real-world constraints. Their moderate clockspeed—slower than software but faster than heavy industry—grants entrepreneurs time to strategically sequence experiments without being overtaken by market shifts. The sector’s remarkable breadth, from batteries and micromobility to aviation and public transit, allows us to validate generalizability across heterogeneous contexts. Crucially, mobility sits at the intersection of AI, robotics, and climate tech—fast-evolving, signal-rich domains that challenge My ability to model stakeholder perception under uncertainty. These qualities make mobility ventures not just an appropriate case, but a high-leverage proving ground for adaptive, evidence-based decision support.

## 2. Need Analysis - STRAP Framework

This section defines the core challenges – differing stakeholder perceptions, circular dependencies, and resource constraints – and maps them to the requirements for a solution. It reviews literature on entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty, pointing out gaps that STRAP will address.
### 2.1 Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Under Uncertainty Literature Review

This section introduces the fundamental challenge: entrepreneurs lack decision making model that is personalized, realistically tractable, actionable — promoting imitating other's behavior and unsystematic experimenting that lowers entrepreneuring quality.

Entrepreneurial decision models span a spectrum of complexity defined by two key dimensions: **operational complexity** (decisions unfolding over time) and **multi-stakeholder complexity** (multiple interacting agents or criteria). At the simplest end of this spectrum are single-stakeholder static strategy models, which consider a one-off strategic choice by a lone decision-maker. These simple models are highly tractable but offer poor reality fit, since they ignore dynamic feedback and the involvement of other stakeholders (e.g., Sarasvathy, 2001; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Increasing the operational complexity yields single-stakeholder dynamic models that incorporate sequences of decisions and learning over time. Such models capture how an entrepreneur adapts through multiple stages (for instance, via staged investment or real options reasoning) while still focusing on one primary actor (Håkansson, 1971; McGrath, 1999).

To better reflect real venture conditions, other models introduce **multi-stakeholder complexity** even in static settings. These multi-stakeholder strategy models consider how an entrepreneur coordinates or negotiates with various actors (investors, customers, competitors) within a single decision context, adding richer criteria to the choice (Gans, Hsu & Stern, 2002; Van den Steen, 2016). This boosts reality fit by acknowledging diverse interests, but tractability remains manageable only because the decision is not sequential. The most comprehensive models embrace both interacting stakeholders and dynamic operations, portraying entrepreneurship as an ongoing process co-created with partners, markets, and investors (Schindehutte & Morris, 2009; Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Roundy, 2018). These high-complexity models achieve a strong fit to entrepreneurial reality (phenomenological richness) but become computationally intractable – indeed, the full **EDMNO** formulation that accounts for all stakeholders over time is NP-complete (as shown in Section 1.1). In essence, the progression from static single-actor to dynamic multi-actor models reveals an engineering-versus-phenomenological trade-off: as I add realism, I lose tractability.

Bridging this tractability–reality gap requires new approaches that retain high reality fit while restoring usability. Rather than abandoning formal modeling, I propose an **engineering** solution that balances these extremes through targeted simplifications and optimization strategies. In this thesis, a three-part framework is introduced to tackle each complexity dimension: **phase-based learning** breaks the decision process into stages to manage operational complexity over time, **proactive hypothesis proposal** uses probabilistic experimentation to navigate multi-stakeholder uncertainty, and **calibrated federated learning** allows entrepreneurs to collectively improve models without sacrificing individual context. Together, these strategies form a mid-complexity decision framework designed to maintain realism (capturing multi-stage, multi-stakeholder dynamics) while remaining computationally tractable. This approach sets the stage for the use cases and solution scope detailed in Section 1.3, aiming to empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

### 2.2 The Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Need Analysis: Mathematical Mapping

In this section, I identify the root causes of entrepreneurial decision-making challenges across three levels and three dimensions, structured as a need matrix, and show how each need maps to specific elements in My mathematical formulations:

| **Level**                   | **Need 1: Perception** (📽️)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Need 2: Sequencing** (⚡)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Need 3: Confirmation** (🔄)                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **2.2.1 Nature**            | Entrepreneurial decisions must respect axioms where action sequences depend on stakeholder weights $\textcolor{violet}{W_j}$ and initial state $\textcolor{green}{S}$                                                                        | Entrepreneurial experiments require consistent constraints across sequential decisions, reflected in the transition function $D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{a}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}$                                                                                                | Multi-stakeholder decisions involve complex interdependencies in belief updates, captured in the mapping $B,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}]$ |

Each cell in this matrix represents not just a conceptual challenge but also maps directly to specific mathematical elements in My formulations, connecting entrepreneurial needs to formal optimization structures:

1. **Perception Challenges** (📽️): These map to uncertainty terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ in the probabilistic formulation and entropy terms $H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a})$ in the primal-dual approach. Perception asymmetry is captured by stakeholder-specific distributions $p_j$ and expectation terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$. Entrepreneurs struggle to understand how stakeholders perceive their ventures. Different stakeholders (investors, customers, partners) project identical startup attributes onto different perceptual dimensions, creating a fundamental information asymmetry problem.  Traditional approaches either assume perfect information or rely on intuitive reading of stakeholder signals. My framework uses perceptual projection models to decode how observable venture attributes map to stakeholder decision spaces, enabling entrepreneurs to optimize information gathering and signal presentation. 
    
2. **Sequencing Challenges** (⚡): These map to the resource constraints $C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$ and action variable $\textcolor{red}{a}$, along with the state transition function $D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{a})$. The dual decision rule provides a computationally tractable approach to this otherwise NP-complete problem by determining which experiments to run based on their information value per cost. Entrepreneurs must sequence actions optimally under severe resource constraints. However, they cannot directly compute the uncertainty reduction per cost for each possible action sequence due to combinatorial explosion. Standard optimization approaches become computationally intractable as variables increase. My bottleneck-driven framework allows entrepreneurs to make near-optimal myopic decisions by decomposing complex metrics into estimable components, focusing resources on experiments that provide maximum information value. This mapping demonstrates how My mathematical formulations capture each dimension of the entrepreneurial decision challenge. The probabilistic formulation emphasizes uncertainty minimization across stakeholders, while the primal-dual approach transforms this into maximizing stakeholder satisfaction likelihood under resource constraints. 

3. **Confirmation Challenges** (🔄): These correspond to the interdependencies between stakeholder states in $B,\textcolor{green}{S}$ and the consistency constraints on expectations $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ across stakeholders. In the dual formulation, Confirmation is addressed through likelihood maximization that aligns all stakeholders' expectations. Entrepreneurs face circular dependencies where stakeholders make simultaneous, interdependent decisions. Investors wait for customer validation, customers require operational proof, and partners need investment signals, creating deadlock situations. Conventional methods tackle stakeholders sequentially, but this approach cannot resolve inherent circularity. My framework enables entrepreneurs to act as central coordinators who leverage information spillovers across stakeholder networks, breaking decision deadlocks through parallel engagement strategies. 

### 2.3 Probabilistic Formulation Overview

This section introduces the unified probabilistic formulation that captures all dimensions of the entrepreneurial decision problem:

$$ \begin{aligned} \min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \quad & \textcolor{violet}{W_d}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{violet}{W_s}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{violet}{W_i}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} && \text{(Objective)} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & B,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}] && \text{(Uncertainty-State Mapping)} \ & C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} && \text{(Resource Budget)} \ & D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'} && \text{(State Transition)} \end{aligned} $$

I explain how this formulation captures the three challenges: reducing uncertainty for individual stakeholders (📽️ perception), aligning multi-stakeholder dynamics (🔄 Confirmation), and selecting actions under resource limits (⚡ bottleneck-breaking).

### 2.4 Primal-Dual Optimization Formulation

I also present the primal-dual optimization formulation that provides complementary insights into the entrepreneurial decision problem:

**Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{violet}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \ & \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \ & p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \ & \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ & \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in {0,1}, \quad \forall j \end{aligned} $$

**Dual (Likelihood Maximization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{violet}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \ & \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{violet}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned} $$

This dual formulation provides critical insights by transforming the uncertainty minimization problem into a likelihood maximization problem—revealing how entrepreneurs can maximize the probability of stakeholder satisfaction while optimizing resource allocation.

## 3. Solution Design: The STRAP Framework

This section introduces how the STRAP framework addresses the identified needs with a **Perception → Action → Confirmation** logic. STRAP integrates two complementary mathematical approaches – probabilistic Bayesian inference and optimization (primal-dual formulations) – to systematically guide entrepreneurial decisions. In essence, STRAP behaves like a “venture GPS” that perceives the stakeholder landscape, plans optimal actions (experiments), and confirms stakeholder alignment, iterating this cycle as the venture learns. I first discuss the theoretical foundations behind this approach, then detail each component (perception modeling, bottleneck sequencing, and stakeholder Confirmation) in turn. The following table presents My comprehensive solution approach across the three dimensions and three levels of entrepreneurial decision-making:

| **Level**                   | **Solution 1: Perception (📽️)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Solution 2: Action (⚡)**                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Solution 3: Confirmation (🔄)**                                                                                                                                                    |

### 3.1 Theoretical Foundations Supporting Perception → Action → Confirmation

Several streams of theory inform the STRAP framework’s structure of **Perception → Action → Confirmation**. At its heart, STRAP treats **strategy as a sequence of core decisions** under uncertainty. This echoes the view that strategy is not a static plan but a **pattern of pivotal decisions** an entrepreneur makes in response to feedback and changing information. Each decision (which experiment to run, which stakeholder to engage next) reshapes the venture’s trajectory – an idea aligning with modern strategic management perspectives that emphasize decision-making over static analysis.

**Bayesian decision theory** provides the normative backbone for STRAP’s perception and action components. Under extreme uncertainty, entrepreneurs benefit from treating their actions as experiments and updating their beliefs about the venture’s viability in a Bayesian manner. STRAP’s **perception modeling** explicitly uses Bayesian inference to capture how stakeholders form beliefs and how those beliefs update with new evidence. Each stakeholder’s decision can be seen as a Bayesian update: they have prior beliefs about the venture, observe the entrepreneur’s actions (signals), and update to a posterior belief that informs their willingness to commit. By embracing Bayesian decision theory, STRAP ensures that new information (e.g. a successful prototype test or market trial) is systematically incorporated into the venture’s strategy. This brings mathematical rigor to the learning process that entrepreneurs undertake intuitively, casting it as **belief update and evidence-based optimization**.

At the same time, STRAP is influenced by **effectuation logic** – the empirical observation that many successful entrepreneurs do not follow a grand predictive plan, but rather **iterate flexibly**, leveraging what they have and co-creating the venture with stakeholders. Notably, Sarasvathy’s effectuation emphasizes forming partnerships (commitments from customers, investors, etc.) early on to reduce uncertainty and create a self-reinforcing path forward. STRAP’s **confirmation (Confirmation) component** mirrors this: rather than assuming stakeholders will independently line up once the product is “proven,” STRAP actively seeks to align stakeholder expectations and trigger joint commitment once a critical threshold of evidence is reached. In other words, it formalizes the effectual principle of **stakeholder co-commitment** by mathematically determining when and how stakeholders can be brought on board together after key uncertainties are resolved. Moreover, effectuation preaches an “affordable loss” approach – focus on experiments you can afford and learn from, rather than aiming for an optimal predicted outcome. STRAP’s **bottleneck sequencing** aligns with this by prioritizing low-cost, high-learning actions first (the essence of affordable loss in a quantitative sense). It combines a predictive logic (using Bayesian probabilities to estimate an action’s information value) with a control logic (adapting the action sequence based on intermediate results), thus bridging classic planning and effectual learning-by-doing.

In summary, these theoretical foundations reinforce STRAP’s Perception → Action → Confirmation cycle. I treat **strategy as a dynamic decision process** (not a static roadmap), use **Bayesian inference** to rigorously update and guide those decisions, and incorporate **effectual insight** by engaging stakeholders in a progressive commitment as uncertainty is reduced. The result is a framework that is both **analytically grounded** and **practically cognizant** of how real ventures evolve. STRAP’s mathematical formulation will show that by perceiving stakeholder needs accurately, acting on the biggest uncertainty-reducing steps, and confirming multilateral buy-in, an entrepreneur can navigate uncertainty in a structured yet flexible way.

### 3.2 Perception Modeling (📽️ Bayesian Stakeholder Modeling) – From Uncertainty to Convincing Power

The first component of STRAP addresses the challenge of understanding how different stakeholders perceive the venture. I develop a **hierarchical Bayesian model** to represent each stakeholder’s decision-making process. The entrepreneur treats each stakeholder’s evaluation of the venture as a random utility model with latent parameters. Concretely, suppose stakeholder $i$ (e.g. a particular investor or customer) will decide whether to support the venture (action like “invest” or “buy”) based on signals $x$ (observable aspects of the venture such as performance metrics, team experience, prototypes, etc.). I model the utility stakeholder $i$ derives from the venture’s current state as:

$Ui=βiTx+εi,U_i = \beta_i^T x + \varepsilon_i,$

where $\beta_i$ is a vector of **stakeholder-specific preference weights** and $\varepsilon_i$ is a random error term reflecting unmodeled factors and noise. If I assume $\varepsilon_i$ follows a Gumbel distribution (standard assumption in logistic models), the probability that stakeholder $i$ will say “yes” (e.g. invest, buy, partner) is given by a logistic function:

$Pi(accept∣x)  =  exp⁡(βiTx)1+exp⁡(βiTx) ,P_i(\text{accept}|x) \;=\; \frac{\exp(\beta_i^T x)}{1 + \exp(\beta_i^T x)} \,$,

which can be generalized to multi-option choices if needed (softmax over multiple outcomes). The vector $\beta_i$ encodes that stakeholder’s **latent preferences** – how strongly they weight various venture attributes when deciding. Because I rarely know $\beta_i$ upfront, I employ a **hierarchical Bayesian approach**: I place a prior distribution on each stakeholder’s $\beta_i$ (for instance, $\beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\beta}, \Sigma_\beta)$ around some average investor or customer profile). As the entrepreneur gathers data (stakeholder reactions, feedback, decisions), they update the posterior for $\beta_i$. This way, the model “learns” each stakeholder’s idiosyncrasies over time. For example, an investor might turn out to care far more about team experience than market size; the Bayesian model will adjust the posterior of $\beta_{\text{investor}}$ accordingly after observing that investor’s responses to various signals.

**Interpreting and leveraging the model:** In essence, this perception model treats each stakeholder’s decision as a rational (but noisy) inference about the venture’s quality. Each stakeholder is acting on their perception of whether the venture will succeed, and the entrepreneur’s task is to **manage those perceptions by providing evidence**. By mapping observable signals $x$ (like a successful pilot, a patent award, or a key hire) to changes in $P_i(\text{accept})$, the entrepreneur can **predict how likely a given action is to convince each stakeholder**. I quantify stakeholder $i$’s **uncertainty** about the venture’s success as, say, the entropy $H(p_i)$ of their belief distribution $p_i$ or simply the variance of their utility $U_i$. High uncertainty means $P_i(\text{accept})$ is very sensitive to new information (their $\beta_i$ isn’t well-pinned down, or many outcomes are possible in their mind), whereas low uncertainty means the stakeholder’s mind is mostly made up (for good or ill). The **primal formulation** of the perception problem can be viewed as **minimizing these uncertainties** $U_j$ across stakeholders, subject to resource limits (I can’t answer every question at once). However, through a dual lens, an equivalent goal emerges: **maximize the likelihood of stakeholder approval**. In fact, a key insight of My framework is that **reducing a stakeholder’s uncertainty is mathematically equivalent to increasing the probability of meeting that stakeholder’s expectations** (Insight 1). By Bayesian duality, **minimizing entropy corresponds to maximizing the concentration of belief on a successful outcome**. Put simply, if an investor is very uncertain, the venture has to cover many bases to satisfy them (many potential concerns); as uncertainty shrinks, the venture’s story can hit exactly what the investor needs to hear, boosting the chance of a yes.

**From “What do they want?” to “What will make them say yes?”** – By modeling stakeholder perception, the entrepreneur shifts from guessing stakeholder desires to **optimizing “convincing power.”** Using the hierarchical model, the entrepreneur can simulate how a given action $a$ (e.g. running a lab test, launching a beta product, securing a customer pilot) will shift stakeholder $j$’s expected outcome $\mu_j(a)$ – essentially the stakeholder’s updated belief of venture success if action $a$ is done. STRAP incorporates a **mean outcome constraint** for each stakeholder: the venture must eventually deliver an expected performance $\mu_j$ that meets stakeholder $j$’s requirement for a yes. In the Bayesian model this relates to ensuring $\beta_j^T \mu_j$ is high enough relative to their decision threshold. The **Lagrange multiplier** associated with this constraint is denoted $\lambda_j$ – one can think of $\lambda_j$ as stakeholder $j$’s **“uncertainty penalty” or demand for evidence**. If $\lambda_j$ is large, stakeholder $j$ currently remains unconvinced and even a decent outcome might not satisfy them; if $\lambda_j$ is near zero, it means that stakeholder’s expectations have effectively been met or they have low remaining skepticism. STRAP’s optimization formulation leverages this: in the **dual objective**, terms like $- \log Z_j(\beta_j)$ appear for each stakeholder, where $Z_j(\beta_j)$ is the partition function (normalizer) of stakeholder $j$’s decision model. Intuitively, $Z_j$ is larger when stakeholder $j$ sees many possible outcomes (high uncertainty) and smaller when their belief is narrowly focused on a particular outcome. Maximizing $- \log Z_j$ is thus equivalent to **concentrating stakeholder $j$’s belief on the favorable outcome**. The dual formulation effectively says: _subject to satisfying basic expected performance for each stakeholder (the constraints), allocate effort to maximize each stakeholder’s approval probability_.

To make this concrete, consider an early-stage **sustainable materials startup (Sublime Systems)** dealing with a **scientist**, a **pilot customer**, and an **impact investor**. Initially, each stakeholder has doubts: the scientist isn’t sure the material will pass lab tests, the customer isn’t sure it will meet cost or quality needs, the investor isn’t sure there’s a market. These are different uncertainties (technical, customer, market), each represented by a $U_j$ and a latent $\beta_j$. Through the perception model, the founder identifies that a **lab validation** will most significantly change the scientist’s and customer’s beliefs (it proves the concept works and is one step closer to a product), whereas a **market survey** might more directly nudge the investor’s belief. By quantifying these effects, the founder sees that the lab test has higher combined “convincing power” per dollar – it drastically reduces two stakeholders’ uncertainty at once. Indeed, when Sublime ran a critical lab test (an action $a_1$), the **scientist’s** perceived technical risk plummeted, and seeing the technical success, the **pilot customer’s** confidence shot up as well (the customer’s expected value $\mu_{\text{cust}}(a_1)$ jumped). In turn, the **investor**, observing both the scientific validation and the customer’s increased interest, updated their own expectations upward (even before any direct market result, the investor infers that “if a reputable customer is excited and the tech works, this could be big”). My Bayesian model captures these **cross-stakeholder belief updates**: one action can send ripples through the stakeholder network. By formally modeling each stakeholder, the entrepreneur can anticipate these ripple effects. In summary, **perception modeling** provides a quantitative map of the venture’s stakeholder landscape – revealing which uncertainties are most critical and how actions will shape each stakeholder’s belief. This map is the foundation for deciding where to act next.

### 3.3 Bottleneck Sequencing (⚡ LP–POMDP Hybrid) – From Information Value to Optimal Action

The second component of STRAP focuses on **what to do next**. Given multiple uncertainties and limited resources, the entrepreneur must decide which experiment or action will yield the **highest payoff in uncertainty reduction**. This is essentially a planning problem under uncertainty – one that can be framed as a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)** if I consider the venture’s state of knowledge as the “state” and experiments as actions. However, POMDPs for real ventures quickly become intractable due to the huge state and action space. STRAP circumvents this by using a **bottleneck-driven heuristic that closely approximates the optimal planning**: at each step, tackle the biggest remaining uncertainty (the bottleneck) in a resource-efficient way. I formulate this as a **linear program (LP)** that selects the action maximizing information gain per cost, effectively a **greedy optimization** that I justify through primal-dual analysis.

**Formulation:** Let $a_j$ be a binary decision variable indicating whether I execute action/experiment $j$ (e.g. run test $j$) in the next step, and let $c_j$ be the cost of that action (in dollars, time, or any critical resource). I define $\Delta U_j$ as the expected uncertainty reduction in stakeholder $j$’s belief if action $j$ is performed (this can be computed from the perception model as the expected drop in entropy or variance for stakeholder $j$). My objective is to maximize total **weighted uncertainty reduction** $\sum_j w_j, \Delta U_j$ (where $w_j$ is the weight representing stakeholder $j$’s importance in the venture’s success). I are constrained by a limited budget $R$ for this stage, e.g. I can only afford a certain total cost: $\sum_j c_j a_j \le R$. I also typically only choose one action at a time (one major experiment in the next step), so one could add a constraint $\sum_j a_j = 1$ for a strict sequential approach. Solving this simple LP picks the action $j$ with the highest $w_j \Delta U_j / c_j$ ratio – in other words, the **highest information gain per dollar**. This greedy selection is in fact the classic solution to a fractional knapsack problem, and it can be proven that if actions are divisible, taking a little of each would equalize their information-per-cost ratios to a common value (the dual optimal $\gamma$). Since actions here are indivisible (you either run the experiment or not), the greedy strategy of picking the largest ratio first is optimal or near-optimal in most cases.

**Dual insight (primal-dual interpretation):** The dual of this LP introduces a Lagrange multiplier $\gamma$ for the resource constraint $\sum_j c_j a_j \le R$. This $\gamma$ represents the **shadow price of resources**, i.e. how much additional total uncertainty reduction I could achieve if I had one more unit of budget. At the optimum, $\gamma$ will equal the information-per-cost ratio of the chosen action (if there were a significantly better ratio action, I would have picked that instead). Thus, $\gamma$ is essentially the **marginal value of an extra dollar** given My current knowledge state. A high $\gamma$ means resources are extremely scarce relative to the uncertainties – every dollar is precious and yields a big jump in knowledge if spent well. A lower $\gamma$ means either I have abundant resources or diminishing returns (the biggest wins are already achieved). As the venture progresses and the easy uncertainties are resolved, $\gamma$ tends to decrease – this reflects diminishing returns on learning (Insight 4: efficiency of learning matters more than sheer spending). In STRAP’s context, $\gamma$ provides a quantitative handle for **when to raise more resources**: if $\gamma$ remains very high, it implies that more funding could significantly boost learning (so earlier-stage ventures often have high $\gamma$, justifying fundraising to enable crucial experiments). If $\gamma$ has fallen low, additional funds won’t help as much because only minor or less critical uncertainties remain.

Combining the perception and sequencing formulations, I derive a **decision rule** for action selection that balances all these factors. The condition for an action $j$ to be optimal (to set $a_j^* = 1$) is:

$$
a_j^* = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } w_j\left[\,\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \mu_j(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)\right] > \gamma\, c_j \\[6pt]
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$


This rule deserves unpacking. The left-hand side is the **weighted benefit** of action $j$: inside the brackets, $\beta_j^T \mu_j(1)$ is the expected utility stakeholder $j$ would get from the venture after action $j$ (i.e. how much $j$’s situation improves), $\log Z_j(\beta_j)$ (with a minus sign) represents the **uncertainty reduction** for stakeholder $j$ (as discussed earlier, a smaller $Z_j$ means more certainty for $j$), and $\lambda_j$ is the current penalty on stakeholder $j$ not yet being fully satisfied (if stakeholder $j$ is very unconvinced, $\lambda_j$ is high, so the framework gives extra weight to persuading that stakeholder). Thus $[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \mu_j(1) - \log Z_j]$ is a composite measure of how much action $j$ moves the needle for stakeholder $j$’s confidence. Multiplying by $w_j$ factors in how important stakeholder $j$ is overall. The right-hand side $\gamma, c_j$ is the **opportunity cost** of the action in terms of scarce resources – essentially the “budget cost” weighted by the current value of budget. If the inequality holds, action $j$ offers more benefit (in terms of increased success likelihood via uncertainty reduction) than its cost, so it’s a go. This condition neatly captures **bottleneck prioritization** (Insight 3): the actions that go forward are those with the highest ratio of uncertainty reduction to cost, adjusted for stakeholder importance.

**Illustrative example – Segway vs. a bottleneck-driven approach:** To see why this sequencing matters, consider the famous case of **Segway**, the two-wheeled personal transporter often cited as a cautionary tale. Segway in the early 2000s had tremendous hype and funding. However, they **sequenced their strategic actions poorly** relative to uncertainties. They poured resources into scaling up manufacturing and marketing (an _investor- and supply-side_ action focus) before resolving the most critical unknown: _Would everyday consumers actually adopt this device at scale?_ In My terms, Segway faced at least three major uncertainties: **demand uncertainty** ($U_{\text{demand}}$: will consumers buy it?), **supply/regulatory uncertainty** ($U_{\text{supply}}$: can it be used safely on streets? will cities allow it?), and **business model uncertainty** ($U_{\text{investor}}$: can this be profitable given costs?). Of these, demand was the **bottleneck** – if demand wasn’t there, it wouldn’t matter if regulations or cost were fine. A STRAP-guided approach would have **prioritized an affordable experiment to test demand** (e.g. produce a small batch and release to a pilot market or a specific segment, such as tech enthusiasts or city tMy companies). If that pilot showed people love the product at the intended price, it would greatly reduce $U_{\text{demand}}$ and send a strong positive signal to investors and regulators (making them more willing to accommodate). If the pilot flopped or revealed lukewarm interest, the company could pivot or save its remaining resources instead of having wasted them on mass production. In reality, Segway did the opposite: they spent _vast resources_ building inventory and hype (multiple **costly actions executed in parallel** on the supply side) without real market validation. The outcome was that by the time Segway tried to sell broadly, they discovered the demand was not as hoped; they had burned through their capital (very high $c_j$ spent on the wrong $j$) for very little uncertainty reduction on the key question (people’s willingness to use it). My framework’s action rule likely would not have picked those scaling actions early, because for the **customer stakeholder** the term $[\lambda_{\text{cust}} + \beta_{\text{cust}}^T \mu_{\text{cust}}(1) - \log Z_{\text{cust}}]$ for a _demand-test action_ would have outweighed that of a manufacturing scale-up. In fact, Segway’s story illustrates Insight 4 vividly: **it’s not the total amount of money raised or spent that determines success, but how effectively each dollar is converted into knowledge and traction**. They had plenty of capital, but low _capital efficiency_ – high $\gamma$ persisted even after spending, meaning each new dollar was still not resolving much uncertainty (it was going into building more units that might not sell).

In contrast, entrepreneurs who sequence actions by breaking their biggest uncertainty first often progress more efficiently. In the **Sublime Systems** case, the founders identified the technical viability of the new cement as the biggest risk (if the cement couldn’t meet strength and safety standards, no amount of customer interest or investor money would matter). They devoted their meager initial resources to a series of rigorous lab tests and small pilot pours, _before_ scaling to a full plant. The first lab validation immediately unlocked a customer letter-of-intent (the pilot construction firm was willing to try it), which in turn made the investors comfortable enough to provide seed funding – a chain reaction that addressed uncertainties one by one. Notably, after the lab test, the “uncertainty penalty” $\lambda_{\text{tech}}$ for the scientist stakeholder plummeted (the technical doubts were largely put to rest), and even $\lambda_{\text{customer}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{investor}}$ dropped as each saw others’ positive responses. The team then used the new funds to do a pilot project with the customer, further reducing market and scale-up uncertainty. By the time they needed big money for a production facility, all major stakeholders were already on board with high confidence – making the Series A fundraising straightforward. This stepwise de-risking reflects a **state transition** in the venture: initially the state $S$ was highly uncertain (high $U_j$ across j), but after each bottleneck action, the state transitioned $S \to S’$ with strictly lower total uncertainty. STRAP explicitly plans for such **state transitions** $D(S, a) = S’$, seeking to **stabilize the venture’s trajectory** as early as possible. By the time Sublime moved to scaling, the venture’s path was almost deterministic – success was by no means guaranteed, but the range of outcomes was well-understood and narrow. This contrasts sharply with Segway, which remained in a probabilistic flux far too long, essentially still experimenting (with the market) at a stage when they thought they were executing. STRAP’s sequencing module thus provides a disciplined way to choose experiments: always spend yMy next dollar where it yields the largest reduction in the chance of failure. By following this principle, entrepreneurs can conserve resources and **build real options**: at any point, if the uncertainties resolve negatively, they still have resources left to pivot or try something else (whereas an undisciplined approach might exhaust resources without ever illuminating the path to success).

### 3.4 Stakeholder Confirmation (🔄 Post-Threshold Joint Confirmation) – From Alignment to Collective Action

The final component of STRAP tackles the **multi-stakeholder Confirmation problem**. Even if an entrepreneur correctly models stakeholder perceptions and sequences experiments well, they face the challenge of **simultaneously closing the loop with all key stakeholders**. Ventures often get stuck in a catch-22: customers won’t commit until investors invest, investors won’t invest until customers show commitment, and partners or regulators might hold off until both customers and investors are on board. These circular interdependencies create a **deadlock** where everyone is “waiting for everyone else”. STRAP addresses this through an approach of **post-threshold joint confirmation** – in plain terms, pushing the system to a tipping point where all stakeholders gain enough confidence _almost at once_, resulting in a coordinated collective go-ahead.

**Federated belief calibration:** In the STRAP framework, after each action I perform a **federated update** of all stakeholder models. This means when a new piece of evidence (experiment result) comes in, I don’t update one stakeholder’s belief in isolation; I update _all_ stakeholders’ inferred beliefs to reflect how that evidence might indirectly inform them. For example, a successful pilot test might obviously change a customer’s own view, but I also update the investor’s model on seeing the pilot succeeded (even if the investor wasn’t the primary target of the test). In essence, stakeholders observe not only the entrepreneur’s direct signals, but also each other’s reactions as signals. STRAP encodes some of these cross-effects in the inference process (e.g., via shared variables or correlations in the hierarchical model). The result is that stakeholders’ expectations $\mu_j(a)$ tend to **converge** as evidence accumulates, rather than evolving totally separately. This is critical because alignment is needed for joint action. If one stakeholder’s expectations lag far behind others, they become a **hold-out** that can stall the venture.

**Joint confirmation logic:** I formalize Confirmation as achieving a state where **all stakeholders’ acceptance criteria are met simultaneously**. Each stakeholder $j$ effectively has a threshold (imposed by their internal model and risk tolerance) that the venture’s expected performance must exceed for them to commit. In the perception model these were the constraints associated with $\mu_j$ and $\lambda_j$. When an action sufficiently increases $\mu_j$ such that $\lambda_j$ goes to zero (meaning stakeholder $j$’s requirement is satisfied with equality), that stakeholder is at a confirmation point. The entrepreneur’s goal is to get **all $\lambda_j \to 0$ at once** for the critical set of stakeholders. In optimization terms, one could frame a **joint probability of commitment** $P(\text{all stakeholders say yes})$ and seek to maximize it. The dual form of this is effectively minimizing any one stakeholder’s “dissatisfaction” (uncertainty or unmet expectation) that could derail the group – akin to a min-max problem across stakeholders. STRAP’s approach results in identifying **which stakeholder interdependencies are causing the greatest drag** on that joint probability and breaking those by targeted actions. Sometimes, the solution is not a new experiment but simply a **synchronized push**: for instance, inviting all key stakeholders to witness a pilot test together, so that no one is second-guessing whether others were impressed – they all see the same evidence at the same time. This was suggested in the Segway case post-mortem: a coordinated demo for customers, partners, and regulators together might have helped align their expectations, rather than Segway engaging them separately and getting fragmented feedback.

**Deadlock resolution through threshold orchestrations:** The phrase “post-threshold” highlights that Confirmation comes into play **after some uncertainties have been reduced** to near-threshold levels. An entrepreneur shouldn’t try to get everyone to say yes from day one – that’s unrealistic. Instead, STRAP says: use perception modeling and sequencing to drive each stakeholder’s uncertainty down to a manageable level (just around their acceptance threshold), _then_ trigger a collective decision. In practice, this might look like doing enough groundwork so that customers are tentatively interested, an investor has given a soft commitment, and a partner has written a memorandum of understanding – then bringing them together for a final confirmation. In the **Sublime Systems** narrative, this happened when the pilot project succeeded: the customer signed a purchase order, the investor moved to term sheets, and even regulators (seeing a major industry player validate the tech) signaled support. The venture reached a critical mass where no stakeholder was the odd one out. In contrast, consider a venture that hasn’t coordinated: one investor might be willing to commit but backs out because they learn customers were less enthusiastic, or vice versa – a sequence of near-misses because stakeholders acted asynchronously. STRAP’s Confirmation component advises _when to convert asynchronous progress into synchronous commitment_. It is at this transition that the venture often moves from the **“Nail it” stage (figuring it out)** to the **“Scale it” stage (executing with everyone onboard)**.

From a mathematical standpoint, successful Confirmation is reflected in the **venture state transition matrix** becoming **absorbing or near-deterministic** once all stakeholders are in agreement. Early in a venture, the state (defined by the tuple of stakeholder belief levels or commitment states) is highly stochastic – actions can lead to many possible next states because any stakeholder might react unpredictably or not as hoped. But if I reach the coordinated threshold, the next state is basically “all-in” by everyone, which then leads to a stable trajectory (growth, scale). Thus, STRAP seeks to drive the system into an **absorbing success state** by aligning beliefs. This fulfills Insight 2: **stakeholder expectation Confirmation is essential to avoid endless ping-pong of indecision**. By explicitly managing who knows what and ensuring stakeholders share the same positive outlook at the decision point, the entrepreneur resolves the “wait for others” paralysis. In summary, the Confirmation module of STRAP formalizes a crucial but often neglected aspect of entrepreneurship – that beyond individual yes’s, you need the **simultaneous yes**. It provides a structured way to achieve that by treating alignment as a quantity to optimize and by timing the collective commitment optimally.

## 4. Results: Empirical Validation and Performance Analysis

The following section evaluates the STRAP framework, using case studies and simulations to demonstrate its efficacy. I particularly compare scenarios inspired by **Segway** (which did not use such a framework) and **Sublime Systems** (which aligns with STRAP principles) to highlight differences.

### 4.1 Setup and Methodology _(Summary)_

_I constructed a simulation of an early-stage venture decision process with three key stakeholders (representing, for example, **Demand**, **Supply**, and **Investor** dimensions). The simulation uses the Bayesian models and decision rules from STRAP to drive an optimal policy, and I also simulate a counterfactual policy that mimics the mis-sequenced approach (like Segway’s actual path). I track key metrics: the stakeholder uncertainty penalties $\lambda_j$ over time, the resource shadow price $\gamma$ over funding rounds, and the state transition matrix $D(S, A)$ evolution as the venture moves from idea to growth. Two panels of visualization are produced for comparison._

### 4.2 Validation and Performance Analysis

To interpret STRAP’s impact, I present a two-panel visualization comparing the **STRAP-guided approach (exemplified by Sublime Systems)** against a **naive approach (exemplified by Segway)**. The left panel of **Figure 1** tracks the evolution of the key parameters $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ across venture stages, and the right panel shows snapshots of the **state transition matrix** in early vs. later stages for each case.

![[Pasted image 20250507221031.png|center|1000]]
_Figure 1: Comparison of parameter evolution and state transition dynamics for a venture following STRAP principles (Sublime) vs. a misaligned strategy (Segway). The left side plots each stakeholder’s uncertainty penalty $\lambda$ (solid lines for Sublime, dashed for Segway) declining as the venture progresses from Ideation through Growth, as well as the resource scarcity price $\gamma$ (violet for Sublime, red for Segway) over successive funding rounds (Seed through Series C). The right side shows the venture state transition matrices $D(S,A)$ at Early Stage and Growth Stage for each venture (Segway in red hues, Sublime in blue/violet hues). Each matrix illustrates the probabilities of moving from a given current state (rows: combinations of stakeholder expectations high/low) to a next state (columns) after one action. Higher values (darker color) along a single row indicate more deterministic transitions._

**Parameter trajectories:** I observe stark differences in the $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ trajectories between the two ventures. For **Sublime (STRAP-guided)**, all stakeholder uncertainty penalties $\lambda_j$ start moderately high but **decline steadily and significantly at each stage**. By the Growth stage, $\lambda$ values approach zero for all three stakeholder types (orange, green, and blue solid lines falling to the bottom of the left plot), indicating that stakeholders have been essentially convinced – their residual uncertainties are minimal. This reflects how STRAP systematically reduced each stakeholder’s major doubts through targeted experiments. In contrast, **Segway’s $\lambda$ values (dashed lines)** also decline with time but **remain substantially higher throughout**. Notably, Segway’s **demand-side $\lambda$ (blue dashed)** stays elevated even into the Launch stage, meaning a core uncertainty (customer adoption) was never fully resolved. The **investor $\lambda$ (orange dashed)** for Segway drops after large investments (they put money in), but because that investment wasn’t predicated on corresponding customer validation, the investor’s uncertainty later crept back in when sales disappointed – effectively, their confidence was premature. These trends underscore Insight 1 in practice: Sublime’s concerted uncertainty minimization translated into a high probability of stakeholder satisfaction, whereas Segway’s remaining uncertainty meant success likelihood never peaked as high.

The **resource shadow price $\gamma$** further differentiates the strategies. Sublime’s $\gamma$ (violet line) starts around 5 (high during Seed stage, indicating each dollar is precious) but then **peaks and declines** to about 2 by Growth. This implies that after the critical early experiments, additional funding had diminishing marginal value – a sign that the venture became more efficient in its learning; money was no longer the bottleneck by Growth. Segway’s $\gamma$ (red dashed line), however, **stays high (~6-7) for longer and declines only slightly** by later stages. In fact, $\gamma$ spikes during the Prototype/Validation stage when Segway poured in resources – meaning even with a lot spent, the venture still had a high marginal value of money (they could have used even more to answer unresolved questions, but they had actually used it ineffectively). A persistently high $\gamma$ reflects resource inefficiency: Segway was throwing cash at problems without significantly reducing uncertainty, so every new dollar was almost as needed as the last. This aligns with **Insight 4** (efficiency of capital use outweighs total capital) – Sublime’s lower $\gamma$ by Growth shows they made each dollar count (each funding round significantly de-risked the venture), whereas Segway’s war chest didn’t buy clarity (high $\gamma$ indicated money was still limiting venture progress because of unresolved unknowns).

**State transition matrices:** The right panel of Figure 1 visualizes how each venture’s **decision-state dynamics** changed from early to later stages. Each matrix is effectively a heatmap of $P(S_{next} | S_{current}, \text{action})$ for the possible aggregate states (here simplified to high/low expectation for each stakeholder). **Segway’s early-stage matrix** (top-right, left side) is quite **diffuse** – for a given current state (row), the probabilities are spread among multiple next states (values 0.4, 0.6, 0.5, etc., with no single dominant outcome). This indicates a highly stochastic evolution: early on, if Segway took an action, the outcome in terms of stakeholder reactions was unpredictable; the venture could land in various states (e.g., maybe customers like it but regulators push back, or vice versa) with no clear certainty. **Sublime’s early matrix** (bottom-right, left side) is also stochastic (as all ventures are at the start), but one can already see slightly more concentration (one outcome per row is a bit darker), suggesting that even initial actions were chosen to target likely desired outcomes (e.g., by focusing on the key bottleneck, Sublime had a higher chance to move into a specifically better state, rather than random directions). By the **growth stage**, the difference is pronounced: **Sublime’s state transition matrix (bottom-right, right)** becomes almost **diagonal with very dark cells** at the desired “all-high” state – effectively an **absorbing state** where if stakeholders are mostly convinced, the next state stays convinced (the venture stays on track with >90% probability of remaining in the success region). This indicates the system has become **nearly deterministic**: given the venture reached a critical mass of buy-in, further actions lead to predictable positive outcomes (e.g., scaling just leads to growth in a straightforward way). On the other hand, **Segway’s later-stage matrix** (top-right, right) still shows significant off-diagonal elements – there are multiple possible next states with considerable probability. For example, even in what they thought was a “high” state, there remained a chance to fall to a lower state (stakeholders backtracking or being disappointed). Segway never achieved a truly absorbing success state; the process remained **path-dependent and uncertain**, reflecting how they never fully aligned all stakeholders (Insight 5: without sufficient uncertainty reduction, the venture’s trajectory stays stochastic rather than locking into a win).

**Venture outcomes:** As expected, the STRAP-guided trajectory (Sublime) achieved a successful outcome (all stakeholders committed and venture scaled) in the simulation with high probability, whereas the Segway-like trajectory had a much lower success probability and higher variability. Beyond success/failure, STRAP provides interpretability: looking at these metrics, an entrepreneur can diagnose _why_ things are going wrong. For instance, if $\lambda_{\text{customer}}$ remains high late in the game, it’s a red flag that customer concerns were never fully addressed; if $\gamma$ is still high after a big spend, it warns that resources were not used effectively to buy down risk; if the state transitions remain unpredictable, it means some stakeholder’s expectations are not aligned or some uncertainty is still lurking. By quantifying these, STRAP turns nebulous entrepreneurial wisdom (“de-risk the venture”, “get everyone on the same page”) into trackable metrics and decision criteria.

Finally, My analysis underscores several **key insights** that connect the mathematics of STRAP to tangible venture outcomes:

- **Insight 1 – Uncertainty vs. Likelihood:** The primal-dual transformation in STRAP shows that minimizing stakeholder uncertainty (entropy/variance) directly **maximizes the likelihood** of satisfying those stakeholders. In practice, ventures that relentlessly drive down uncertainty for each stakeholder dramatically increase their overall chance of success (as seen with Sublime vs. Segway’s stakeholder confidence levels).
    
- **Insight 2 – Confirmation to Break Deadlocks:** **Stakeholder expectations must be coordinated** to avoid “waiting for others” deadlocks. The analysis revealed that aligning stakeholders’ belief updates (e.g., via shared pilots or synchronized communication) was critical to Sublime’s tipping point, whereas Segway suffered from fragmented stakeholder buy-in.
    
- **Insight 3 – Bottleneck-First Action:** The **highest ROI experiments (uncertainty reduced per dollar)** should be done first. STRAP’s bottleneck sequencing embodies this, and the case comparison showed how addressing the biggest unknown (demand for Segway, technical viability for Sublime) before anything else yields far better outcomes. A focused experiment can eliminate a whole branch of risk, enabling all subsequent efforts to build on a solid base.
    
- **Insight 4 – Resource Efficiency over Quantity:** **Using resources efficiently matters more than amassing resources.** Sublime succeeded with relatively limited funding by optimally allocating it to learning, reflected in declining $\gamma$ and rapid knowledge gain. Segway, despite ample capital, failed to convert money into equivalent progress (high $\gamma$ persisted) and illustrates that simply having funds is not enough – it’s the _information value_ extracted per dollar that counts.
    
- **Insight 5 – From Stochastic to Deterministic:** Successful venture development is marked by a shift from a high-variance, stochastic process to a low-variance, predictable one. By the later stages, STRAP-guided ventures like Sublime **achieved near-deterministic state transitions** (everyone is on board, so outcomes of actions are certain within normal business variation), whereas Segway remained probabilistic (key players still not fully convinced, so any move had risk of unexpected fallout). This insight captures the essence of “de-risking”: eventually, if you solve enough uncertainties, the rest of the journey is straightforward execution.
    
These insights, borne out in both the mathematical model and the case comparisons, demonstrate how STRAP not only improves the odds of venture success but also provides a **clear explanatory framework**. Entrepreneurs can pinpoint why a strategy is or isn’t working and course-correct with principled decisions. In essence, STRAP offers a way to **navigate uncertainty with strategy** – perceiving the road ahead, acting on the biggest obstacles, and confirming that all travel companions (stakeholders) are moving forward together.


### 4.3 Uncertainty Assessment and Limitations
Despite its contributions, the STRAP framework has several important limitations driven by modeling simplifications and tractability-oriented design choices. First, it collapses a venture’s multi-dimensional uncertainty into a weighted linear combination of stakeholder-specific uncertainties. This additive objective (summing $U_d, U_s, U_i$ with fixed weights) assumes independent contributions from each stakeholder domain, potentially overlooking interaction effects or nonlinearities in how uncertainties jointly impact outcomes. Similarly, stakeholders are represented in a coarse way: the model considers only a few homogeneous stakeholder groups (e.g. investor, supplier, customer), with fixed importance weights $W$ and an initial uncertainty state $S_0$ for each. This approach cannot capture heterogeneity within a stakeholder group – in practice, different investors or customers may perceive and evaluate the venture very differently – nor can it reflect dynamic shifts in stakeholder influence over time. Another limitation is how interdependent stakeholder decisions are handled. The current framework acknowledges cross-stakeholder dependencies (e.g. an investor’s commitment might hinge on prior customer adoption) but addresses them only indirectly, by sequentially “leveling” uncertainties across stakeholders rather than modeling their decisions simultaneously. In other words, STRAP coordinates stakeholders by first equalizing their confidence levels and then proceeding, instead of explicitly capturing circular wait-and-see dynamics – a simplification that aids analysis but may reduce realism in scenarios where stakeholder actions truly coincide. Furthermore, to preserve computational tractability the STRAP rule employs a greedy, one-step optimal policy: at each iteration the entrepreneur pursues the action with the highest uncertainty-reduction-per-cost benefit (the steepest “information gain” per resource spent). While this heuristic efficiently breaks the current biggest bottleneck, it might sacrifice long-term optimality if certain actions yield synergistic benefits only in combination or if an initially suboptimal step unlocks better opportunities later. Finally, the framework relies on model parameters that may be challenging to calibrate in practice – such as quantifying each stakeholder’s uncertainty and weighting them (W), or estimating the impact of each possible action ($\mu_j$, $\beta_j$) on those uncertainties. Misestimation of these inputs or changes in the external environment could limit the framework’s generalizability beyond the contexts tested. These assumptions and simplifications could be relaxed in future work (for example, allowing richer stakeholder heterogeneity or a concurrent game-theoretic decision model at the cost of higher complexity), and exploring such extensions would help assess how robust STRAP’s recommendations remain when its more restrictive constraints are lifted.

# 5. Discussion

### Entrepreneurial Operations Perspective (Fine et al., 2022)

My framework’s emphasis on systematically reducing uncertainty aligns with recent insights in entrepreneurial operations. Fine et al. (2022) argue that startups require domain-specific operations management tools and stage-specific tactics as they scale. They document how ventures that attempt “naked scaling” (growing without tailored operational processes) often become chaotic, and they propose a catalog of ten scaling tools (e.g. **processification**, **segmentation**) to introduce needed structure. While My approach focuses on decision-making under uncertainty, it complements Fine’s operational lens by providing a quantitative method to decide _which_ process or experiment to implement first. Moreover, Fine et al. highlight that startups adopt different modes – some are **capability-first** (operations-centric) while others are **customer-first** – depending on context. My personalized STRAP model captures this contingency: by adjusting the initial state S0S_0 and weights WW, an entrepreneur can calibrate the framework to a capability-driven mode (emphasizing supply-side experiments) or a customer-driven mode (prioritizing demand-side tests). This ability to **personalize the decision model** makes My results more realistic, echoing Fine’s call for context-contingent guidance. In essence, STRAP provides a flexible decision engine that works in tandem with the operational “toolkit” approach – helping to determine when to apply tools like processification or segmentation based on which uncertainty is most critical in the venture’s current stage.

### Entrepreneurial Strategy Perspective (Gans et al., 2019)

My findings also resonate with the entrepreneurial strategy literature, particularly the framework of Gans et al. (2019). Gans and colleagues confront the paradox that even with rigorous analysis, founders often face **multiple, equally plausible strategic paths** and must eventually commit to one. To navigate this, they derive the heuristic “**Test Two, Choose One**,” which advises entrepreneurs to experiment with at least two strategic alternatives before selecting the best path forward. This stopping rule underscores the “shadow cost” of experimentation – additional tests provide information but delay commitment. My STRAP framework generalizes this idea by formally quantifying the trade-off between learning and moving ahead. Instead of a fixed “test two then stop” rule, STRAP’s **Sequential Threshold Reduction for Actionable Perceptions (STRAP)** adaptively signals when to move from testing to action. In particular, the **dual formulation** in My model yields a clear threshold for action: when the expected gain from reducing uncertainty falls below the resource “price” of further experiments, the entrepreneur should choose a path (analogous to Gans’s stopping rule). Notably, Gans et al. encourage entrepreneurs to actively **choose their strategic environment** rather than passively accept it. STRAP operationalizes this by allowing founders to simulate outcomes under different stakeholder scenarios (different S0,WS_0, W settings) and then _select_ the scenario in which to commit. Thus, My results reinforce Gans et al.’s emphasis on entrepreneurial choice while providing a more fine-grained, quantitative decision criterion that accounts for resource constraints and the nuanced value of information.

### Real Options Theory and Staged Experimentation

The sequential decision process enabled by My framework is grounded in principles akin to **Real Options Theory** in strategy. Real options reasoning posits that when facing high uncertainty, managers should make staged, low-commitment investments to “keep upside potential open while truncating downside losses”. This logic is evident in many entrepreneurial practices such as phased product trials or pilot programs. My uncertainty-minimization approach formalizes such staging: each experiment can be seen as purchasing an “option” to continue the venture under improved knowledge, while the **dual variable** (My resource shadow price) represents the option’s exercise threshold. Early in a venture, when uncertainty is greatest and resources are scarce, My model sets a high threshold (high γ\gamma) for pursuing an experiment – effectively only allowing actions with a large information yield per dollar (a high “real option” value). This mirrors real options advice to invest in only the most uncertainty-resolving projects first. Conversely, as uncertainty diminishes (e.g. after some successful tests) and resources expand, the threshold γ\gamma lowers, permitting smaller or riskier bets – analogous to exercising options and expanding commitment as confidence grows. By mathematically linking uncertainty reduction to the probability of venture success (My dual interpretation), I address a classic challenge in real options models: providing a concrete trigger for action. In essence, STRAP provides a computationally tractable way to apply real-options style thinking to entrepreneurial strategy, whereas prior real options approaches often remained qualitative (encouraging a mindset of flexibility) or were too complex to apply for day-to-day startup decisions. My results demonstrate that it is possible to **quantify the value of experimentation** in entrepreneurship and determine an optimal stopping point for learning, which bridges the gap between abstract real-options reasoning (e.g. “stage yMy investments” per McGrath, 1999) and practical decision-making guidance.

### Stakeholder-Centric Strategy Lens

A core premise of My work is that a startup’s strategic direction can be defined by **which stakeholder uncertainties it tackles first**. This offers a novel lens on strategy that is complementary to traditional product-market definitions. Prior studies hint at this perspective: Fine et al. observed that some ventures focused on building internal capabilities (operations partners, supply chain) before courting customers, whereas others did the opposite. I generalize this idea by identifying three stakeholder categories—customer (demand-side), operational partner (supply-side), and investor (resource-side)—and allowing the entrepreneur to prioritize among them through action selection. The combination of which two stakeholder groups are addressed early effectively shapes the venture’s path. For example, a **customer–investor focus** (testing market demand while pitching to investors) yields a different trajectory than a **customer–partner focus** (working closely with early adopters and a supply partner before seeking outside capital). My case analysis (e.g. the Segway scenario) illustrates that pursuing any single category to the exclusion of others is rarely viable; instead, successful entrepreneurs sequence their focus, often temporarily satisfying two stakeholder constituencies while deferring the third. This aligns with the notion that a startup must achieve a minimum viable alignment among stakeholders to progress. Strategy, in this view, is the art of choosing _which_ stakeholders to align first and which to keep in flux until later. Gans et al.’s advice that entrepreneurs surface multiple alternatives and “choose which strategic environment to situate their idea in” can be interpreted as choosing which stakeholder context to bet on initially. My framework makes this explicit: by tuning the weights WW on each uncertainty type, founders can simulate different “stakeholder-first” strategies and see how the likely outcomes change. The results show that this stakeholder-centric approach yields a coherent strategy definition – one that is especially useful in multi-sided or platform ventures where deciding whether to acquire customers, partners, or funding first is the quintessential strategic decision.

### Addressing Technical Challenges and Broader Applications

Beyond theoretical comparisons, My work explicitly tackles key technical questions raised in the introduction and methods, paving the way for long-term applications:

- **Personalization and Realism:** By incorporating the initial state S0S_0 (prior beliefs about stakeholder metrics) and customizable weight vectors WW for uncertainties, the framework adapts to each venture’s unique context. This personalization dramatically enhances realism. For instance, a biotech startup with assured demand but high technical risk can start with S0S_0 reflecting low customer uncertainty but high technical uncertainty, and assign weights that prioritize R&D experiments. In contrast, a consumer app might weight market experiments more. Such tailoring means My model’s recommendations mirror the _actual_ challenges a founder faces, avoiding the one-size-fits-all bias that plagues generic startup advice. In effect, the STRAP framework serves as a decision GPS, adjusting its route based on the terrain (industry norms, founder background, macro-economic climate) to remain relevant and valid for that specific venture. This addresses the need for context-aware decision support and answers the question of long-term applicability: a personalized model remains applicable as the venture evolves or as it is deployed across different domains.
    
- **Tractability and Interpretability of the Dual Formulation:** A major contribution of My approach is demonstrating that one can achieve computational tractability _and_ intuitive interpretability in entrepreneurial decision models. Traditional formulations that consider multiple stakeholders and sequential decisions (e.g. full POMDP models or dynamic programs) become intractable very quickly. I overcame this by adopting a primal-dual optimization framework. The **primal** side focuses on uncertainty reduction under resource constraints, while the **dual** side provides economic intuition – each stakeholder’s uncertainty has an implicit “price”, and the resource budget has a “shadow price” γ\gamma that sets a **threshold** for worthwhile actions. This dual variable γ\gamma yields a simple rule: _only pursue experiments that offer an expected likelihood improvement per cost above γ\gamma_. Such a rule is not only easy to compute (since γ\gamma adjusts until an optimal balance is found) but also easy to explain to practitioners as “bang-for-buck.” The dual formulation thereby translates complex math into the familiar language of trade-offs (e.g. “Is this test worth it given My burn rate?”). This clarity sets My framework apart from prior models and ensures it can be used for **long-term planning**: entrepreneurs can update their γ\gamma as budgets change or as earlier experiments reduce uncertainty, maintaining a clear decision criterion at each step.
    
- **Generality across Domains (Uncertainty–Environment Fit):** The principles of My decision framework are designed to generalize beyond the specific mobility case used for illustration. I explicitly structured the model around categories of uncertainty and stakeholder interactions that are present in virtually all entrepreneurial domains (customers, operating partners/suppliers, investors/backers). This abstraction means that the same STRAP process — Perception → Action → Confirmation guided by uncertainty reduction value — can be applied whether the venture is in clean energy, software, healthcare, or any other field. What changes is the “uncertainty-environment fit,” i.e. the profile of uncertainties characteristic of that industry or business model. My approach readily accommodates these differences: for a given domain, one can initialize S0S_0 to represent the typical unknowns (e.g. in pharma, regulatory approval probability might be a key state; in a two-sided marketplace, getting a critical mass of one user side is a key uncertainty) and set resource constraints according to that environment’s norms. I have essentially **factorized entrepreneurial decisions** from the domain specifics – the model doesn’t hard-code any mobility-specific parameter, which is why it can generalize. In comparative studies, I expect that applying My framework to different industries will yield strategies that “fit” those environments (for example, more sequential testing in highly regulated industries, more parallel experimentation in fast-changing consumer tech), confirming that the model’s logic adapts to the context. This generality is a strong indicator of long-term usefulness: the framework could serve as a backbone for decision-support tools or pedagogical simulations across a wide range of entrepreneurial scenarios, with only the need to plug in industry-specific uncertainty data.
    

### Implications for Future Work

The encouraging alignment of My framework with diverse strands of research and its adaptability across contexts opens up several avenues for future work. One immediate implication is the opportunity to **empirically validate** the STRAP rule in real startup settings: researchers could track ventures as they apply My uncertainty-driven experiments and compare their performance or pivot frequency against those following more ad-hoc decision processes. Another promising direction is to extend the model’s multi-stakeholder aspect – future research might incorporate additional stakeholder groups (e.g. regulators or community stakeholders in social enterprises) to test the limits of tractability and see how the decision rules adjust. There is also room to refine the personalization aspect by developing a library of domain-specific S0S_0 and WW presets (a “playbook library”) that new founders could choose from, which would effectively operationalize the contingency insights of Fine et al. and others. In the long term, integrating My framework with rich data (e.g. using machine learning to better estimate uncertainty reduction from various actions) could make the recommendations even more precise and dynamic. I see the STRAP approach as a starting point for a new class of entrepreneurship strategy tools – ones that blend rigorous optimization with the flexibility of real options and stakeholder theory. By anchoring strategic choices in quantitative uncertainty reduction, future work can build on this foundation to help entrepreneurs not only make better decisions in their ventures, but also contribute to a more scientific understanding of entrepreneurship as a process of iterative learning and commitment. The result would be a deeper unification of entrepreneurship research and practice, ensuring that theoretical advances directly inform actionable guidance for the founders of tomorrow.

## Appendix A: Stakeholder 📽️Perception  Modeling

Entrepreneurs can model stakeholder decision-making as a **hierarchical Bayesian random utility process**, capturing heterogeneity in perceptions and rational choice under uncertainty. I assume each stakeholder $i$ evaluates a venture’s observable signals $x$ (e.g. product features, team credentials) and infers an *unobserved* latent quality of the venture (sometimes called a *“phantom” attribute*). In other words, stakeholders interpret observable venture characteristics as noisy indicators of underlying venture quality. This inference is treated as *noisily rational*: stakeholders update their beliefs in a Bayesian manner given the signals, then choose actions that maximize their perceived utility, subject to error.

Formally, let $U_{i,j}$ denote stakeholder $i$’s utility for a decision option $j$ (for example, $j=1$ might be “invest in the venture” and $j=0$ “decline”). I use a random utility model where:

$$
U_{i,j} \;=\; x_j^{T}\beta_i \;+\; \varepsilon_{i,j}\,,
$$

with $\beta_i$ a stakeholder-specific preference vector and $\varepsilon_{i,j}$ an idiosyncratic error term. If I assume $\varepsilon_{i,j}$ follows an extreme value type-I (Gumbel) distribution (i.e. each stakeholder makes **logit**-style noisy decisions), then the probability that stakeholder $i$ chooses option $j$ is given by the logistic choice function:

$$
P(y_i = j) \;=\; \frac{\exp\!\big(x_j^{T}\beta_i\big)}{\sum_{k} \exp\!\big(x_k^{T}\beta_i\big)} \,,
$$

as in a multinomial logit model. The vector $\beta_i$ captures stakeholder $i$’s latent preferences or belief weights—how strongly they value each venture signal $x$—and I model these preferences in a **hierarchical Bayesian** manner. In particular, I place a prior on each stakeholder’s $\beta_i$ such that:

$$
\beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\beta},\, \Sigma_{\beta})\,,
$$

meaning stakeholders are drawn from a population with mean preference $\bar{\beta}$ and covariance $\Sigma_{\beta}$. This hierarchical structure allows the entrepreneur to account for heterogeneity: some stakeholders may be more team-focused, others more market-focused, etc., but all share a common underlying distribution. By observing stakeholder choices (or feedback) and updating the posterior of $\beta_i$, an entrepreneur can learn about an individual stakeholder’s particular biases and expectations.

Notably, stakeholders may base their decisions on inferred qualities that are *not directly observable* to the entrepreneur. These latent perceptions are analogous to the *phantom attributes* described by Bell and Dotson (2022)—features of a product or venture that “influence choice but are latent artifacts of the decision process.” In My context, a stakeholder might infer an unobserved trait (e.g. the venture’s trustworthiness or long-term scalability) from observed signals like pricing, branding, or founder background. Entrepreneurs can incorporate such latent factors by extending the design matrix $x$ to include *unobserved* attributes and using Bayesian inference to estimate them (treating them as missing data to be learned). While detailed methods for identifying these latent attributes are beyond My scope, the key is that the hierarchical model can flexibly accommodate both observed and inferred signals.

**Interpretation – Noisy Rational Inference:** This framework implies that a stakeholder’s decision is a *probabilistic, rational response* to the venture’s signals. Each stakeholder behaves as if updating their belief about the venture’s quality (the posterior distribution of the latent attribute) and then choosing the action that maximizes expected utility. The logistic choice model adds controlled “noise” to reflect uncertainty and idiosyncrasies in decision-making. For the entrepreneur, this means stakeholder decisions can be predicted (and influenced) by managing the signals $x$: providing clearer or more convincing venture data will shift the stakeholder’s $\beta_i$-weighted evaluation upward and increase the probability of a favorable decision. In summary, **stakeholder decisions are modeled as noisy rational inferences over projected venture signals** – each stakeholder is making the best decision they can given their perception of the venture, and the hierarchical Bayesian logit model formalizes this process mathematically.

## Appendix B: Multi-Stakeholder 🔄Confirmation Mechanics

When multiple stakeholders are involved, their decisions often become **interdependent**. Entrepreneurs frequently encounter **circular dependencies** where each stakeholder’s commitment depends on others: for example, investors wait until there are confirmed customers; customers hesitate until the venture has reputable investors and a proven product; partners or regulators want to see signals of support from both investors *and* customers. These feedback loops can create *deadlock situations* in which no single stakeholder is willing to move first. Effective entrepreneurial strategy must therefore *coordinate* stakeholders – aligning their expectations and actions so that everyone is willing to commit in concert.

To reason about Confirmation, it is useful to represent the stakeholders’ joint decisions in a **stakeholder decision matrix**. Consider a simple case of two stakeholders (A and B) each deciding whether to support a venture (Yes = 1) or not (No = 0). Each stakeholder has two possible actions, so the combined outcomes can be laid out in a $2\times2$ matrix:

* **Both say No (0,0):** The venture fails to gain support. This outcome might occur if both stakeholders independently conclude the venture isn’t viable *or* if each is waiting for the other to make the first move.
* **A says Yes, B says No (1,0):** Stakeholder A commits but B holds out. A’s support alone may be insufficient; A might later withdraw or incur loss if B never joins. This asymmetry is unstable – A acted on an expectation that B would follow, which didn’t happen.
* **A says No, B says Yes (0,1):** Symmetrically, B commits while A does not. This is the flip side of the above, and just as unstable.
* **Both say Yes (1,1):** The venture gets full support. This is the coordinated outcome needed for success (assuming the venture truly requires both A and B).

In this example matrix, the **coordinated equilibrium** outcomes are the corners where decisions are aligned (either both support or both don’t). The off-diagonal cells (one supports, the other doesn’t) reflect *misalignment* – one stakeholder’s positive expectation wasn’t shared by the other. In practice, if the venture is promising, the goal is to move stakeholders toward the **(Yes, Yes)** outcome (everyone supports); if the venture is not viable, all should correctly settle on **(No, No)**. Either way, *consistency* is key. The entrepreneur’s role is to facilitate information flow and incentives such that stakeholders reach a consensus decision rather than acting at cross purposes.

I model each stakeholder’s individual decision process with a **sigmoid-based decision function**, which provides a smooth approximation of the threshold behavior in commitment. Let $d_i \in {0,1}$ indicate stakeholder $i$’s decision (0 = no support, 1 = support). I define the probability of support as a logistic function of that stakeholder’s perceived venture success likelihood (or utility) $u_i$:

$$
P(d_i = 1) \;=\; \sigma(u_i) \;=\; \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\kappa\, u_i)} \,,
$$

where $u_i$ represents stakeholder $i$’s **confidence** in the venture (e.g. how strongly they believe the venture will succeed or meet their requirements), and $\kappa$ is a steepness parameter. If $u_i$ is high (the stakeholder is confident), $P(d_i=1)$ approaches 1; if $u_i$ is very low, $P(d_i=1)$ is near 0. For intermediate levels of confidence, the sigmoid curve captures the idea that the stakeholder might go either way, reflecting uncertainty. In the limit of $\kappa \to \infty$, this becomes a step function (hard threshold): $d_i=1$ if $u_i>0$, else $d_i=0$. Thus, the logistic form provides a principled, differentiable model of each stakeholder’s decision rule.

**Interdependence and Confirmation:** The complication in a multi-stakeholder setting is that each $u_i$ (stakeholder’s confidence) is not formed in isolation. Stakeholder $i$’s confidence $u_i$ will generally depend on their **expectations of other stakeholders’ actions or beliefs**. For instance, if stakeholder A expects stakeholder B to invest (which increases the venture’s chance of success, providing capital or credibility), then A’s own $u_A$ will rise. Conversely, if A expects B to back out, $u_A$ may drop. I end up with a coupled system of equations: $u_i = f_i(\text{signals, and } d_{-i})$ where $d_{-i}$ indicates the actions of the other stakeholders. In a fully rational equilibrium, all these expectations are mutually consistent (each stakeholder’s expectation about others’ decisions is correct). Achieving this consistency is the essence of Confirmation.

Mathematically, one can impose **consensus constraints** to enforce expectation alignment across stakeholders. One useful constraint is to require that all stakeholders (and the entrepreneur) share the **same predicted outcome** for the venture's next state or success metric. For example, using the expected outcomes $\mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a})$ from My primal-dual formulation, Confirmation can require:

$$
\mu_1(\textcolor{red}{a}) \;=\; \mu_2(\textcolor{red}{a}) \;=\; \cdots \;=\; \mu_N(\textcolor{red}{a}) \;=\; \mu_e(\textcolor{red}{a}) \,.
$$

In words, **everyone is on the same page** about the venture's prospects. This alignment of expected outcomes (which could be probabilistic beliefs about state transitions, revenue projections, etc.) means no stakeholder is significantly more optimistic or pessimistic than another -- a prerequisite for them to comfortably move forward together. If such equalities hold, then for any stakeholders $i$ and $j$, their confidence levels $u_i$ and $u_j$ should be compatible, leading to mutually reinforcing decisions. In the two-stakeholder example above, reaching the (Yes,Yes) cell requires that A and B both believe in the venture's success with high confidence, which in turn requires aligning their beliefs about the venture's fundamentals.

**Confirmation Update Rules:** Achieving expectation alignment in practice may require iterative updates as new information is shared. I outline a simple iterative mechanism by which an entrepreneur can drive stakeholders toward consensus:

1. **Signal Exchange:** The entrepreneur (or one of the key stakeholders) shares credible information with all parties. This could be new evidence of traction (e.g. a successful pilot, a signed customer contract) or a preliminary commitment (e.g. a lead investor agreeing to invest contingent on others). These signals serve as common knowledge inputs that can shift everyone's expectations.
2. **Belief Update:** Each stakeholder updates their internal model of the venture after receiving the new signal. In Bayesian terms, they revise their expected outcome $\mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a})$ using the evidence. For instance, if a pilot result shows the product works, both investors and customers raise their success estimates. Formally, stakeholder $j$ adjusts $u_j$ (their confidence utility) based on the signal; if I denote the signal by $\Delta$ (e.g. a change in expected growth), the update might be $u_j \leftarrow u_j + w_j \Delta$, where $w_j$ is stakeholder $j$'s weight on that evidence.
3. **Expectation Reconciliation:** The stakeholders and entrepreneur compare their updated expectations. If discrepancies remain (say one investor is still unconvinced while others are confident), further rounds of evidence or discussion occur. The entrepreneur might address specific concerns of the outlier stakeholder by providing targeted information (reducing that stakeholder's uncertainty). Through successive rounds, the goal is to **converge** the $\mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a})$ values across all stakeholders $j$. This is analogous to a consensus algorithm: each iteration should bring beliefs closer. Once all stakeholders' $\mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a})$ values (and the entrepreneur's $\mu_e(\textcolor{red}{a})$) are nearly equal, all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the venture's likely outcome.

Using $\mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a})$ consistently across both the primal-dual formulation and the appendices creates a more unified framework and reduces the total number of variables, making the model more elegant and easier to understand.

In practice, the above Confirmation process can be implemented in a decentralized way (each stakeholder adjusting based on observed actions of others) or centrally facilitated by the entrepreneur who orchestrates information flow. The **sigmoid decision functions** ensure that as each stakeholder’s confidence $u_i$ grows (due to alignment on a positive outlook), their commitment probability $P(d_i=1)$ sharply increases. Eventually, a tipping point is reached where every stakeholder is willing to say “yes” because they expect everyone else to say “yes” as well. By the same token, if the venture truly does not warrant support, transparent sharing of negative signals will align stakeholders on saying “no,” avoiding wasted resources. The result of successful Confirmation is a **simultaneous, consistent decision set** – analogous to an equilibrium where each stakeholder’s decision is optimal given the others’. The entrepreneur’s Confirmation mechanics thus transform what could be a game of strategic waiting into a collaborative, information-driven convergence of decisions.

### C.1 Mapping EDMNO Components onto the Primal-Dual Formulation

Each core component of the EDMNO framework--**Perception** (📽️), **Confirmation** (🔄), and **Sequencing(⚡)--corresponds to a particular aspect of the primal-dual optimization model. **Figure C.1** illustrates this mapping: the primal problem (uncertainty minimization) and its dual (likelihood maximization) are annotated to show which part emphasizes each component. In the primal formulation, the *entropy terms* in the objective function capture **perception** (📽️) by quantifying uncertainty in stakeholder beliefs. The *constraints* that enforce consistency across stakeholders' expectations encapsulate **Confirmation** (🔄), since they tie together interdependent stakeholder outcomes. Finally, the *resource budget constraint* and its Lagrange multiplier in the dual highlight **sequencing (⚡), reflecting how scarce resources focus the entrepreneur on critical actions. This formulation explicitly "connects all three components of My framework"--in perceptual modeling it optimizes information gathering (entropy reduction), in multi-stakeholder Confirmation it aligns predictive models across stakeholders, and in bottleneck-driven experimentation it prioritizes high information value per resource unit.

[diagram: EDMNO primal-dual mapping. Perception (📽️) corresponds to maximizing entropy/information in the primal (highlighting terms like $H(p)$) and normalization via the partition function in the dual. Confirmation (🔄) corresponds to multi-stakeholder constraints in the primal (coupling different $p_j$ via shared expectations $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}$) and to the likelihood terms $\beta_j^T\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}- \log Z_j$ in the dual that enforce cross-stakeholder consistency. Bottleneck Breaking (⚡) corresponds to the resource constraint ($\sum_j c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \le \textcolor{skyblue}{R}$) in the primal and the dual variable $\gamma$ (with threshold condition for $\textcolor{red}{a_j^*}$) that drives action selection under resource limits.](#)

*Figure C.1:* **EDMNO Components in the Primal-Dual Optimization Framework.** The primal problem minimizes total uncertainty (weighted entropy) subject to stakeholder expectation constraints and a resource budget, while the dual problem maximizes a weighted log-likelihood of stakeholder satisfaction minus resource cost. Icons mark the formulation pieces most associated with each EDMNO component: the entropy term ($H(p)$) for perception, coupling constraints for Confirmation, and the resource limit (with dual $\gamma$) for bottleneck-breaking.

### C.2 Primal and Dual Variables: From Mathematical Roles to Business Meaning

The primal-dual formulation introduces decision variables ($p$, $\textcolor{red}{a}$) and Lagrange multipliers ($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\gamma$) that carry intuitive business interpretations. **Table C.1** translates each variable into plain-English meaning and provides a startup example (from My Entrepreneurship Optimization Proposal) to illustrate:

| $p$ (probability distribution)        | **Primal decision variable** -- represents the probability assigned to each possible outcome scenario for a stakeholder (subject to entropy maximization).                                                                                                                                                                              | **Belief distribution for outcomes:** The entrepreneur's current bets on how a stakeholder's response or market outcome might turn out, given what actions have been taken. This reflects uncertainty about that stakeholder -- a spread-out $p$ means we're still very unsure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | *Example:* For an eco-construction startup, $p$ could be the distribution over an **eco-builder's reactions** to a new cement product (e.g. 60% chance of mild interest, 30% chance of strong adoption, 10% chance of rejection) before running a pilot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     |     |
| $\textcolor{red}{a}$ (action vector)  | **Primal decision variable** -- indicates which actions/experiments are chosen (often binary or fractional) under resource limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Chosen experiments or strategic moves:** Each component of $\textcolor{red}{a}$ corresponds to an action the startup can take, such as a test or partnership, set to 1 if selected. This encodes the plan of attack the entrepreneur decides on to reduce uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | *Example:* $\textcolor{red}{a} = [\text{segment}, \text{collaborate}, \text{capitalize}]$ might represent **(1) targeting a test with a lab**, **(2) approaching an eco-builder partner**, **(3) pitching to a VC**.

| $\lambda$ (one per stakeholder $j$)   | **Dual variable for normalization constraint** -- ensures each stakeholder's probability distribution $p_j$ sums to 1; appears in the dual as an additive term to the objective.                                                                                                                                                        | **Baseline log-likelihood / bias term:** $\lambda_j$ adjusts the "baseline" likelihood for stakeholder $j$ being fully satisfied, before considering specific evidence. In business terms, it can be seen as the inherent optimism or skepticism that stakeholder $j$ has toward the venture **absent new data** (a calibration factor making the probabilities sum to 100%). A high $\lambda_j$ (more positive) would mean a stakeholder is inherently easier to satisfy (or has fewer baseline demands), whereas a low or negative $\lambda_j$ indicates a tougher crowd requiring evidence to even reach a neutral stance. | *Example:* For an **investor** stakeholder, $\lambda_{\text{inv}}$ might start low (even negative) if the default stance is "not convinced" until proven otherwise. As the startup shows traction, effectively $\lambda_{\text{inv}}$ rises -- the investor's baseline confidence improves, boosting the overall likelihood term for the investor in the dual objective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     |     |
| $\beta$ (vector, per stakeholder $j$) | **Dual variable(s) for expectation constraint** -- Lagrange multipliers associated with matching stakeholder $j$'s predicted outcome $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ to the distribution's expectation. They appear in the dual inside $\beta_j^T \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ and $\log Z_j(\beta_j)$. | **Stakeholder requirement weight:** $\beta_j$ captures how strongly I need to **"tilt" stakeholder $j$'s outcome distribution** to meet their expected value $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}$. Intuitively, $\beta_j$ reflects stakeholder $j$'s *demand level or sensitivity*: if $\beta_j$ is large in some direction, it means the stakeholder has stringent expectations on a certain metric, forcing the entrepreneur's plan to heavily favor outcomes meeting that metric. It's like the "pressure" stakeholder $j$ exerts on the solution.                                                                                  | *Example:* If a **customer** expects a certain product performance (say durability or cost savings), the corresponding $\beta_{\text{cust}}$ will adjust to ensure the probability distribution $p_{\text{cust}}$ places sufficient weight on outcomes where that expectation is met. A higher $\beta_{\text{cust}}$ might mean the startup must **heavily skew its efforts to satisfy the customer's key requirement** (e.g., by allocating R&D to meet a durability standard), since failing that drastically lowers the likelihood of customer adoption.                                                        |     |     |
| $\gamma$ (scalar)                     | **Dual variable for resource constraint** -- shadow price of the total resource $\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$, appears in dual objective as $-\gamma \textcolor{skyblue}{R}$ and in the decision rule for $\textcolor{red}{a^*}$.                                                                                                            | **Resource scarcity price / threshold factor:** $\gamma$ represents the *opportunity cost of a unit of resource*. A higher $\gamma$ means resources (time, cash) are very tight, so each dollar or week must yield a high payoff in uncertainty reduction -- it sets a **threshold for action selection**. In effect, $\gamma$ is how much "likelihood gain" I demand per unit cost. Only actions with information value per cost above $\gamma$ will be chosen. As resources become less scarce (more slack or funding), $\gamma$ drops, lowering the bar for which actions are worth doing.                                | *Example:* Early in the project, with a tiny budget, $\gamma$ is high -- the startup only does the most critical experiment (e.g., a small pilot that addresses the biggest unknown). After raising funds, $\gamma$ falls, and more experiments (like scaling up a prototype or testing secondary features) clear the bar. In the **TAXIE** EV rideshare case, initially $\gamma$ was effectively high, so they tested with just 2 cars (only that limited experiment had a justifiable info-per-cost ratio). With more capital, they could afford a broader rollout of 50 cars to tackle secondary uncertainties. |     |     |

*Table C.1:* **Primal and Dual Variables in Business Terms.** This table links each mathematical variable to an intuitive role in entrepreneurial decision-making, along with concrete examples. For instance, $p$ and $\textcolor{red}{a}$ correspond to the startup's beliefs and action choices (which experiment to run), while the dual variables $\lambda$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ correspond to the underlying "pressures" of the problem: stakeholders' baseline attitudes ($\lambda$), their specific demands ($\beta$), and the scarcity of resources ($\gamma$).

### C.3 The Partition Function $Z_j(\beta_j)$: Normalization and the "Menu" of Outcomes

In the dual formulation, each stakeholder $j$ contributes a term $-\log Z_j(\beta_j)$, where

$$
Z_j(\beta_j) \;=\; \sum_{k} \exp\!\big(\beta_j^T f_{jk}\big)\,,
$$

summing over all possible outcome states $k$ for that stakeholder. This $Z_j(\beta_j)$ is the **partition function**, and its role is to ensure probabilities for stakeholder $j$ are properly normalized when I convert the constraints into a likelihood. In plain terms, $Z_j$ **"accounts for all possible outcomes"** when computing the likelihood of any one outcome.

**Intuition (Menu Analogy):** Imagine stakeholder $j$ has a "menu" of possible outcomes (for example, a customer might either love the product, like it, be neutral, or reject it). The exponentiated term $\exp(\beta_j^T f_{jk})$ can be thought of as the "score" or weight for outcome $k$ given the current dual parameters $\beta_j$. The partition function $Z_j(\beta_j)$ is like summing up the scores of **every item on the menu**. By dividing an individual outcome's score by this total $Z_j$, I get a probability (just as each item's popularity could be expressed as a fraction of all items' combined popularity). In other words, $Z_j$ is the normalizing denominator that makes all the outcome probabilities add up to 1. If stakeholder $j$ has many favorable possible outcomes (or a high uncertainty, meaning many outcomes get moderate weight), $Z_j$ will be larger; if $j$'s requirements and $\beta_j$ strongly favor only a few outcomes, $Z_j$ will be smaller (concentrating probability on those outcomes).

Crucially, the partition function also influences the **likelihood** of satisfying stakeholder $j$. A smaller $Z_j(\beta_j)$ (all else equal) means the probability mass is concentrated on high-scoring outcomes -- effectively, stakeholder $j$'s expectations leave fewer "acceptable" outcomes, but those few are being targeted. A larger $Z_j$ means a wider spread of possible outcomes, implying more uncertainty or more ways things could go (not all of which are good for the venture). In the dual objective, I see $-\log Z_j(\beta_j)$: this term **rewards** the solution when $Z_j$ is lower (since $-\log Z_j$ is higher), i.e. when the outcomes are more narrowly focused on meeting stakeholder $j$'s expectations. Thus, minimizing $Z_j$ (without violating the mean outcome constraint) is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood that stakeholder $j$ ends up satisfied. The partition function is the mathematical vehicle for this normalization: it converts the constraint "meet stakeholder $j$'s expected value $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}$" into a probabilistic likelihood of success for that stakeholder by considering all possible outcome scenarios consistent with that expectation.

### C.4 Dual Objective as Likelihood Maximization

The dual optimization problem can be interpreted as **maximizing a weighted likelihood** that all stakeholders will be satisfied given the chosen actions. In My formulation, the dual objective is:

$$
\max_{\lambda,\beta,\gamma}\;\;\sum_{j} \textcolor{violet}{w_j}\Big(\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)\Big)\;-\;\gamma \textcolor{skyblue}{R}\,,
$$

where $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}$ is the weight of stakeholder $j$. Each term $\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}- \log Z_j(\beta_j)$ inside the sum is essentially the **log-likelihood for stakeholder $j$** under the optimal distribution (it derives from enforcing that $p_j$ matches the expected outcome $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}$). Multiplying by $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}$ just scales it by the stakeholder's importance. Summing across $j$ thus accumulates a kind of **"total log-likelihood" that all stakeholders' requirements are met**, up to the weighting. Finally, the term $-\gamma \textcolor{skyblue}{R}$ subtracts the "cost" of using resources $\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$ with shadow price $\gamma$.

This dual can be understood in everyday terms: I are choosing the dual variables (which relate to stakeholder satisfaction criteria and resource tightness) to **maximize the probability of overall venture success** (subject to the resource limit). By strong duality, this is equivalent to the primal goal of minimizing uncertainty. But the dual viewpoint is particularly enlightening for narratives -- it frames the problem as *likelihood maximization*:

* **Plain English interpretation:** I want to make it as **likely as possible** that every stakeholder is happy with the outcome *at the same time*, given I can only spend $\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$ resources. The dual objective captures this by boosting the score when stakeholder $j$'s likelihood of satisfaction increases (through the $-\log Z_j$ term) and penalizing if I use too much resource (through $\gamma \textcolor{skyblue}{R}$). In essence, it's a balancing act: allocate effort (via $\beta_j$ adjustments and picking actions $\textcolor{red}{a}$ that influence $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}$) such that the *joint likelihood* of satisfying all parties is maximized.

* **Startup scenario example:** Think of a founding team considering their next moves. They might say, "What course of action gives us the **best shot that both the customer and the investor end up happy?**" This is exactly what the dual is asking. Suppose running a pilot project will greatly increase the chance customers love the product and also give investors data to be confident -- that corresponds to increasing the terms inside $\sum_j(\cdot)$ for those stakeholders (higher log-likelihood for each). If the pilot is expensive, $\gamma$ will rise to reflect the cost, but if it's the only way to significantly boost those success probabilities, the trade-off might still be worth it. The dual objective helps formalize this trade-off: an optimal solution would indicate if the likelihood gains (customers + investors being satisfied) per dollar spent are worth the cost. If yes, $\gamma$ adjusts such that the inequality $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j] > \gamma c_j$ holds for that action, meaning action $j$ (the pilot) is chosen. In practical terms, that inequality is the rule: *"Do action $j$ if its contribution to stakeholder-satisfaction likelihood (left side) exceeds the resource cost threshold (right side)."*

When the dual objective is maximized, it corresponds to a point where **any feasible change would lower the combined likelihood of stakeholder satisfaction (or violate the resource limit)**. This is why I say the dual solution yields a **likelihood-maximizing plan**: it's the set of stakeholder probability distributions and chosen actions such that I couldn't make all-around stakeholder happiness any more probable without more resources. Entrepreneurs intuitively seek this outcome -- they often speak of *de-risking* the venture. In dual terms, de-risking means **increasing the likelihood of success** (for investors, customers, partners, etc.) by reducing uncertainty. For example, by doing a well-chosen pilot test, you reduce investors' uncertainty, which *increases the probability they will invest.* That is literally an increase in the "likelihood term" associated with the investor stakeholder. As uncertainty falls, the dual objective's value (summed log-likelihood) rises, reflecting a more confident, credible venture.

To ground this in a scenario: imagine an early-stage clean-tech startup. Initially, the chance that **customers** will adopt the product might be low because they doubt its reliability; similarly, the **investor** might assign a low chance to the startup hitting cost targets. The entrepreneur can do a targeted experiment, say a prototype demonstration, that convinces both groups (customers see reliability, investor sees cost data). This single action will dramatically increase the likelihood of customer and investor satisfaction (their individual probabilities shoot up). In the dual formulation, $\log Z_{\text{cust}}$ and $\log Z_{\text{inv}}$ drop (since their distributions tighten around "success"), and thus the objective sum increases. The resource cost of the demo enters via $\gamma$, but if the demo is highly informative, the optimal $\gamma$ will adjust such that it is worthwhile to spend that resource. The end result is the **maximum likelihood** configuration: the venture has maximized the weighted log-probability of meeting all stakeholders' expectations, given its budget.

### C.5 Stakeholder Satisfaction as a Weighted Log-Likelihood

I often refer to the dual objective as maximizing the "weighted log-likelihood of all stakeholders being satisfied/accurate." Let's unpack this phrase. Each stakeholder's "satisfaction" essentially means **their internal model of the venture matches the eventual reality**--in other words, the outcome met their expectations. For an investor, being satisfied might mean the company achieved the milestones or traction they expected; for a customer, it means the product performed as promised; for a regulator, it means compliance standards were met. If each stakeholder's expectations are like hypotheses about the venture, then stakeholder $j$ being satisfied is the event that hypothesis is confirmed by results.

The dual formulation gives each stakeholder $j$ a log-likelihood contribution $\mathcal{L}_j = \lambda_j + \beta_j^T\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}- \log Z_j(\beta_j)$. Exponentiating (and ignoring weights $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}$ for a moment), $\exp(\mathcal{L}_j)$ is proportional to the probability that stakeholder $j$'s expectations hold true (since it's essentially the probability of the "successful" outcomes for stakeholder $j$ under the optimized distribution). If I consider all stakeholders at once, a simplifying (though conceptual) view is to imagine the probability that **every** stakeholder is satisfied as roughly the product of the individual probabilities $\prod_j P(\text{stakeholder }j \text{ satisfied})$. Maximizing this joint probability is equivalent to maximizing the sum of logs, $\sum_j \log P(j\text{ satisfied})$. My dual exactly does a weighted version of this: $\sum_j \textcolor{violet}{w_j} \log P(j\text{ satisfied})$. The weights $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}$ allow the model to emphasize some stakeholders more (perhaps an investor's satisfaction is crucial, so its weight is higher, whereas a minor partner's satisfaction is less critical and might get a lower weight).

In practice, **if one stakeholder is very important**, the solution will allocate actions to boost that stakeholder's likelihood of satisfaction even if it slightly hurts others, reflecting the weighting. The phrase "all stakeholders being satisfied" doesn't mean every stakeholder absolutely must be happy in the end, but that I are considering the combined likelihood (with weights) of satisfying everyone as much as possible. I are effectively maximizing a weighted geometric mean of stakeholder satisfaction probabilities.

Importantly, **stakeholder satisfaction = their model matches reality**. This is captured in the primal by the constraint that each stakeholder's expected value $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ is met by the distribution $p_j$, and in the dual by the terms involving $\beta_j$ and $Z_j$. When the dual objective is high, it means each stakeholder's predicted outcome is likely to occur (their distribution $p_j$ is peaked around the expectation). Thus a high dual objective corresponds to a state where **stakeholders' mental models are accurate** -- they guessed what would happen, and the venture delivers on those guesses. This is exactly what satisfaction means: no nasty surprises, only fulfilled expectations.

From an entrepreneurial perspective, achieving this is gold: it means *every major backer or participant in yMy venture feels vindicated*. The investor saw the growth they hoped for, the customer got the value they were promised, the team met the technical goals -- all stakeholders' internal narratives align with the venture's actual trajectory. The weighted log-likelihood formulation mathematically encodes this alignment and rewards the entrepreneur for configurations that enhance it.

It's worth noting that **disagreement or misalignment among stakeholders often signals innovation potential**. If stakeholders initially have very different beliefs (for instance, one investor thinks the idea is brilliant while another is skeptical), that indicates a novel, uncertain venture. Research in entrepreneurial finance and strategy has noted that such divergence in beliefs can motivate entrepreneurial action: for example, an overconfident entrepreneur (holding a belief much more optimistic than others) might pursue an idea that common consensus would skip. This "disagreement" can be a predictor of innovation as it means not everyone agrees on the outcome -- in other words, there's uncertainty to exploit. My model starts with possibly high entropy (un-aligned stakeholder views) and through experiments and Confirmation, aims to align beliefs (reduce entropy), effectively **turning stakeholder disagreement into agreement via evidence**. Scholars have also observed that misaligned expectations can stall innovation if not addressed: a promising idea might languish if, say, regulators remain unconvinced while entrepreneurs forge ahead. Thus, maximizing the weighted log-likelihood of stakeholder satisfaction isn't just a mathematical exercise -- it corresponds to the very real task of **getting everyone on the same page**. When achieved, it indicates that the venture has resolved most uncertainties to the point that all key players believe in it. The dual optimum, therefore, represents a state of maximal consensus (weighted by importance) grounded in reality, which is precisely when a venture is most likely to succeed.

*(Footnotes: As Eric Van den Steen and others have theorized, a strategic decision is often one about which competent people may disagree -- the presence of differing priors is what gives strategy (and innovation) its significance. And Bernardo & Welch (2001) argue that entrepreneurs' apparent overconfidence (beliefs differing from the crowd) can be what drives them to attempt breakthroughs. However, until those differences in expectation are reconciled by evidence, innovative projects face friction. The framework here can be seen as a way to systematically reconcile those expectations.)*

### C.6 From High $\gamma$ to Low $\gamma$, High $\lambda$ to Low $\lambda$: Increasing Certainty and Decreasing Interdependence

Innovative decision-making often progresses through **phases** -- early on, uncertainty and interdependence are high, and later on they diminish as the venture "finds its groove." In My primal-dual terms, this corresponds to moving **from high to low values of certain dual variables ($\gamma$ and $\lambda$)**.

* **Resource Scarcity ($\gamma$) High to Low:** In the earliest stage of a startup, resources are extremely limited -- the dual variable $\gamma$ starts high, meaning the threshold for taking an action is very stringent. The entrepreneur can only afford experiments that have a huge bang-for-buck in reducing uncertainty. This is the **"nail it" phase** (to use a common phrase), where you focus on the single biggest unknown. For example, in the Segway case (personal transporter innovation), early development funds were tight, so they might have only tackled the most critical question (perhaps technical feasibility) before anything else. As the venture proves aspects of the idea and perhaps raises more capital or generates revenue, the effective $\gamma$ drops. More resources become available, so the criterion for acceptable experiments eases. The startup enters a growth or **"scale it" phase** -- $\gamma$ now low -- where it can pursue second-order questions and optimizations (additional features, broader tests) that earlier would have been tabled. In short, **high $\gamma$** = extremely selective, only sure-win moves; **low $\gamma$** = can take moderate-risk or exploratory moves because resources allow. This trajectory from high to low $\gamma$ reflects *increasing certainty about the venture's core viability* (hence investors or revenues are providing slack) and thus the venture is less bottlenecked by each dollar.

* **Stakeholder Alignment ($\lambda$) High to Low:** Early on, stakeholders are not on the same page. One way to think of $\lambda_j$ (from each stakeholder's normalization constraint) is as a measure of how much "baseline adjustment" was needed to calibrate that stakeholder's probability distribution. In an unaligned situation, some stakeholders might effectively have very low prior likelihood to be satisfied -- requiring a large $\lambda_j$ correction upward once evidence starts coming in (or vice versa). **High $|\lambda|$** in the beginning can indicate that, without evidence, stakeholders either wildly overestimate or underestimate the chances of success (differing priors). As the entrepreneur gathers data and demonstrates progress, stakeholders update their models. The need for a large offset $\lambda_j$ diminishes; stakeholders begin to share a more common expectation grounded in reality. Thus **$\lambda$ values tend toward zero or a moderate level** as alignment is achieved. In My context "from high to low $\lambda$" means moving from a state where stakeholders had strongly different initial biases (requiring significant adjustment) to a state where stakeholders have been calibrated and their beliefs are close to the truth (minimal bias). Essentially, the venture goes from a **heterogeneous belief state** to a more **consensus belief state**. For instance, if an investor initially thought the market size was tiny (low prior) while the founder thought it was huge, the truth might be somewhere in between -- early on, the dual might need a large $\lambda_{\text{inv}}$ to satisfy the investor's constraint once some evidence is shown. Later, both founder and investor converge on a similar view of the market, so $\lambda_{\text{inv}}$ can relax. Lower $\lambda$ indicates less disagreement between stakeholder expectations and the achieved outcomes; it marks **increasing certainty and trust** among the players.

* **Environment: From Dynamic to Static Expected Outcomes:** In early stages, the expected outcomes $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ for each stakeholder $j$ are highly context-dependent, stochastic or rapidly changing: one action can have unpredictable ripple effects across stakeholders. For example, when **Segway** was first introduced, an action like a public launch could cause significant changes in $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ for multiple stakeholders simultaneously in unpredictable ways -- media hype, government regulatory responses, consumer curiosity or backlash -- a highly dynamic, coupled system. Similarly, My material startup (e.g. a sustainable cement venture "Sublime Systems") in its pilot phase faced dynamic interactions: getting a test facility on board (action $\textcolor{red}{a_1}=1$) could suddenly change the expected outcomes $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ for customer interest and investor commitment in nonlinear ways (perhaps the expected values for two stakeholders jump significantly after one breakthrough). 

  Over time, once the venture has "tipped" into wider acceptance (e.g., the expected outcomes $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ for most key stakeholders are sufficiently high), the system's evolution becomes more **static or predictable**. In later stages, $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ might respond in more deterministic ways to actions: for a mature product, doing a standard scale-up (action) leads to a fairly predictable result (expected outcomes change smoothly, e.g. sales grow in a known pattern). The interdependence between stakeholders decreases -- by then, each stakeholder has mostly committed, and their expected outcomes $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ are not so contingent on one another at every step. In the Segway story, after initial hurdles, if it had gained regulatory approval in major cities and some consumer adoption, further actions like marketing would have had straightforward effects on $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ (more sales, basically a traditional scenario). For the cement startup, once the testing authority, an eco-builder, and a major investor all have high $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ values (full acceptance), the next state transitions (like expanding production) don't involve one stakeholder's expected outcome dramatically altering another's stance; the stakeholders' expectations are now set, and the remaining work is executional (static in relative terms).

These transitions--**high $\gamma$ to low $\gamma$, high $\lambda$ to low $\lambda$, dynamic to static expected outcomes**--all reflect the venture moving from a chaotic, uncertain **exploration phase to a more stable exploitation phase**. In doing so, **certainty increases** (I know more about what works, stakeholders have evidence and are confident) and **interdependence decreases** (decisions become more modular as stakeholder commitments firm up).

To make this concrete, consider **Sublime Systems**, the sustainable cement startup example we've used. Initially, it's in "Nail-It" mode with three critical stakeholders: a testing lab (for validating the cement), an eco-conscious builder (customer), and a climate-focused VC (investor). At the very start, $\gamma$ is high -- they maybe only have funds for one major test. They choose the test that will break the biggest uncertainty bottleneck: getting the cement certified by the testing lab (setting $\textcolor{red}{a_1}=1$). At this point, the expected outcomes $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ are dynamic: if the lab test is successful, it drastically reduces the builder's uncertainty (maybe $\mu_{\text{builder}}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ jumps significantly as a result, because the builder was waiting on validation). This is a dynamic chain reaction. Also, initially the lab and builder may not have believed the cement would work (their $\lambda$ adjustments were large when evidence comes). 

Once the lab validation is secured, $\gamma$ drops a bit (they might get a bit more funding or at least they know they don't need to test that again) and now they can do a pilot with an eco-builder (setting $\textcolor{red}{a_2}=1$). The system still has some dynamics (perhaps that success convinces the investor, so $\mu_{\text{investor}}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ increases significantly after $\mu_{\text{builder}}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ does -- another dynamic jump). By the time the expected outcomes for two of the three stakeholders are high, they reach a critical mass (an inflection point). 

Now they enter "Scale-It": $\gamma$ is much lower (they raised a VC round, so more resources), $\lambda$ for all stakeholders is near a stable value (everyone's expectations are aligned that this will work and be profitable), and $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ becomes more predictable. If they invest resources (action $\textcolor{red}{a_3}=1$) to build a full production plant, the outcome is mostly deterministic growth in output and revenue -- not a wild card. The stakeholders are committed, so further actions don't have to juggle delicate interdependencies. In summary, the venture moved from a **highly-coupled, high-uncertainty regime** to a **decoupled, low-uncertainty regime**. The primal-dual model captures this as moving along the dual variables: $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ relaxing, and in the problem structure: $\textcolor{#3399FF}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ effectively becoming more predictable and less interdependent as the expected outcomes for all stakeholders reach satisfactory levels.
### C.7 Prioritizing High-Value Experiments in Resource-Constrained Settings

A recurring theme in this appendix is that entrepreneurs must choose carefully **which experiments to run**, especially when resources are limited. Academic work supports this idea: *not all experiments are equal*, and doing the ones with the greatest information yield or option value first is crucial. Kerr, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf (2014) describe entrepreneurship itself as a form of **experimentation under constraints**, noting that only a few experiments will succeed and that **costs and constraints govern how much experimentation can be done and even the trajectory of innovation**. In practical terms, this means a startup should tackle experiments that either validate the venture’s core hypotheses or unlock major stakeholder commitments before spending resources on smaller questions. Their work emphasizes that the distribution of outcomes is “extremely skewed” – most projects fail or give low returns, and a few give huge returns. Therefore, an entrepreneur with one shot (high $\gamma$ early on) should choose an experiment that, if it works, yields a disproportionately large leap in venture progress (for example, proving the technology works *and* that customers want it, in one go).

My framework’s bottleneck-driven approach (⚡) aligns with this logic. It effectively says: **find the bottleneck uncertainty (the experiment that has the highest ratio of uncertainty reduction to cost) and do that first**. This mirrors the recommendation in *Entrepreneurship as Experimentation* to focus on high “real option” value projects when financing is tight. When resources are constrained, entrepreneurs act like scientists with a very limited supply of lab reagents – they must design experiments that maximize learning per dollar. Oftentimes, this means designing tests that simultaneously address multiple stakeholder concerns (as My multi-stakeholder Confirmation 🔄 component advises). For instance, instead of testing a product feature in isolation, a startup might do an integrated pilot that tests the technology, gets customer feedback, and provides data to investors in one fell swoop. This consolidated experiment might be costly, but its **information value is enormous**, and if it succeeds it can justify further investment. Conversely, an experiment that yields only marginal insight should be deprioritized when every dollar counts.

One way to formalize this prioritization is through a **stopping rule for experimentation**, derived from balancing the costs of testing with the risks of not testing (false positives vs false negatives). In the user’s proposed “📦 Multiple Hypothesis Testing + Inventory Management” framework, the decision of how many experiments to run can be likened to an optimal order quantity problem balancing two types of errors:

* Type I error (false positive) = launching something that fails (analogous to overstocking inventory that doesn’t sell).
* Type II error (false negative) = failing to pursue something that would have succeeded (analogous to understocking and missing sales).

By assigning a cost to each type of error, one can derive an optimal number of tests $n^*$ that minimizes total expected “error cost”. A simplified quantitative stopping rule from that framework is:

$$
n^* \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{\alpha^2 \,\big(\mu - \phi_{\text{true}}\big)\,\big(\mu/\phi_{\text{true}}\big)}{c^y}}\;-\;\alpha\,,
$$

where each parameter is defined as follows:

* $\mu$ = the prior believed probability of success for the venture/hypothesis (before running new experiments).
* $\phi_{\text{true}}$ = the true probability of success (the actual outcome frequency if I knew it – in practice, I infer this after some testing).
* $\alpha$ = a prior confidence level (the strength of My initial belief, expressed as a multiplier – higher $\alpha$ means I were more confident in $\mu$ and thus require more evidence to change My mind).
* $c^y$ = the cost of one experiment (normalized as a fraction of total resources or in relative terms such that the formula is dimensionless).

This formula comes from equating the marginal benefit of reducing uncertainty with the marginal cost of additional tests, akin to the economic order quantity formula in inventory management. Intuitively, $\alpha^2(\mu - \phi_{\text{true}})$ represents the squared error in My prior belief (weighted by prior strength) – a larger discrepancy between what I believed ($\mu$) and reality ($\phi_{\text{true}}$) increases the desired sample size. The factor $(\mu/\phi_{\text{true}})$ further inflates the required tests if I were overly optimistic ($\mu > \phi_{\text{true}}$) – essentially penalizing “overconfidence” by demanding more evidence. Meanwhile, dividing by $c^y$ means the cheaper the experiment, the more tests I can afford (so I increase $n^\*$ if cost per test is low). Finally, subtracting $\alpha$ accounts for the fact that if I already have strong prior evidence (high $\alpha$), I need fewer new tests beyond what’s implicit in that prior.

**Example – TAXIE case:** TAXIE was an electric taxi startup used in My discussions, which needed to decide how many pilot cars to test. They had a prior belief of $\mu = 0.5$ that the concept would succeed (moderate optimism), but in reality the market success probability $\phi_{\text{true}}$ turned out to be 0.2 (quite low). Their prior confidence was $\alpha = 2$ (meaning the prior was based on limited information, a relatively weak prior). The cost per car test was estimated as $c^y = 0.15$ (perhaps 15% of their initial budget per car). Plugging these into the formula:

$$
n^* = \sqrt{\frac{2^2 \times (0.5 - 0.2) \times (0.5/0.2)}{0.15}}\;-\;2 
= \sqrt{\frac{4 \times 0.3 \times 2.5}{0.15}}\;-\;2 
= \sqrt{20}\;-\;2 
\approx 4.47\;-\;2 \approx 2.47\,.
$$

They should run about $2.47$ experiments – in practice, of course, this means **2 to 3 test cars**. Indeed, TAXIE proceeded with a pilot of 2 cars, which My calculation suggests was near-optimal. Those tests yielded critical information: they confirmed some hypotheses (range was sufficient, drivers earned what was expected, customers were willing to pay a target price) and refuted others (the service wasn’t profitable at small scale). Stopping after 2-3 cars was justified because the incremental learning from a 3rd or 4th car was not worth the cost at that early stage – better to pause and reassess with the data in hand (which is exactly what the startup did).

This stopping rule exemplifies how an entrepreneur can quantitatively plan an experimental campaign. It says: “Run just enough tests such that the expected cost of remaining uncertainty equals the cost of the testing itself.” If you test too little, you risk a Type II error (missing out on a viable venture due to undetected potential, or not realizing a flaw before scaling – costly in hindsight). If you test too much, you risk Type I error or simply waste resources (diminishing returns – you might confirm what you already know while burning cash and time). The formula helps find a sweet spot. In sum, the entrepreneur should prioritize the highest-value experiment (largest $\mu - \phi_{\text{true}}$ impact per cost) and continue testing until the value of information drops off. This approach merges statistical thinking (hypothesis testing) with economic thinking (inventory/resource optimization), ensuring that in a resource-constrained setting, **every experiment is worth it** and the process stops at the right time to either pivot or double-down.
