Stakeholder Prioritization is Complex for entrepreneurs (fast new)

① Large # of Variables

- Fast: more interaction n(n-1)/2
- New: game theoretic (recurrent reasoning among agents)

② Small # of Constraints

- Fast: lack of time and tool for systematic data collection 
- New: 

**Module Instructions:** Establish stakeholder prioritization as fundamentally complex, emphasizing both the "fast" (time pressure) and "new" (innovation) dimensions that create computational and strategic challenges.

Entrepreneurial stakeholder prioritization is exponentially complex due to "new" and "fast" environmental dynamics. "New" dynamics introduce emerging technologies, geopolitical shifts, and novel opportunities that create dynamic capability requirements for continuous resource reconfiguration (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). "Fast" dynamics accelerate stakeholder interactions under severe time pressure, creating exploration-exploitation tensions where traditional planning approaches fail (March, 1991; Thomke & Reinertsen, 2012). Entrepreneurs must simultaneously manage potential stakeholder interactions while facing Knight's (1921) "true uncertainty" where probability distributions cannot be estimated (Sarasvathy, 2001). This combination increases prioritization complexity that scales non-linearly with stakeholder count. Traditional operations research approaches assuming stable parameters and clear objectives become insufficient, necessitating new frameworks for simultaneous prediction and optimization under extreme uncertainty.

**Core Innovation:** This research addresses this challenge by **optimizing the priority of stakeholders and one's own quality simultaneously** - treating both as random variables within an integrated framework rather than fixing one to optimize the other.
