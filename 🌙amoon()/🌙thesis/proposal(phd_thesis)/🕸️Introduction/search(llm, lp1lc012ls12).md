# STRAP Literature Search Prompt (LLM-Optimized)

This prompt is designed for use across LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) to help discover and evaluate academic papers that match the roles in a theory-driven entrepreneurship paper introducing the STRAP framework.

## Paper Contribution Summary

In our manuscript, STRAP (Strategic Threshold-based Action Prioritization) is proposed as a prescriptive decision framework to help early-stage entrepreneurs determine which stakeholder to engage first under conditions of uncertainty, interdependence, and limited resources. The literature review is structured into two sections:

1. **Problem Validation (Sensemaking)** – Clusters 1–4:
   - These clusters identify and validate the **three root causes** of stakeholder sequencing failure in entrepreneurship: 
     - stochastic stakeholder behavior, 
     - inability to evaluate the impact of actions, and 
     - lack of operational guidance.
   - They build the case that the STRAP framework is addressing a *real, unmet problem*.

2. **Frontier Limitations (Relating)** – Clusters 5–6:
   - These clusters review **frontier-level literature** that attempts to solve parts of the problem but falls short due to limitations in belief-based modeling and lack of integration.
   - They justify the *novelty and necessity* of STRAP by showing that even advanced tools don't offer tractable, prescriptive solutions for entrepreneurs.

## Literature Clusters and Search Roles

### Cluster 1 – Context & Prevalence of the Sequencing Dilemma
- **Objective**: Show the real-world importance of stakeholder sequencing using startup failure data.
- **Look for**: Reports or articles showing that premature supply investment or scaling without demand leads to failure.
- **Keywords**: "startup premature scaling", "stakeholder sequencing failure", "Webvan case study", "product before market"
- **Journals/Sources**: CB Insights, Startup Genome, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review
- **Contribution**: Establishes the urgency and scale of the stakeholder sequencing problem.

---

### Cluster 2 – Stakeholder Utility Complexity (Cause 1)
- **Objective**: Validate that stakeholders behave stochastically and interdependently.
- **Look for**: Empirical or theoretical work on two-sided markets, network effects, or coordination failures.
- **Keywords**: "stakeholder interdependence", "chicken-and-egg startups", "ecosystem adoption"
- **Journals**: Journal of Business Venturing, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, Strategic Management Journal
- **Contribution**: Demonstrates that stakeholder sequencing isn’t a simple linear problem—it involves interlocking probabilities and dependencies.

---

### Cluster 3 – Entrepreneurial Evaluation Incapacity (Cause 2)
- **Objective**: Show that entrepreneurs struggle to evaluate the outcomes of their own actions or stakeholder responses.
- **Look for**: Field experiments, RCTs, or decision-process studies in entrepreneurship.
- **Keywords**: "entrepreneur action-outcome misjudgment", "startup feedback bias", "effectuation vs causation"
- **Journals**: Organization Science, Journal of Business Venturing, Management Science
- **Contribution**: Validates that lack of action-feedback clarity is a central cause of strategic missteps.

---

### Cluster 4 – Operational Optimization Gaps (Cause 3)
- **Objective**: Identify the absence of usable operational rules for entrepreneurs.
- **Look for**: Conceptual or case-based work on failure of OM tools to apply to startups.
- **Keywords**: "entrepreneurial operations", "real options in startups", "capacity scaling logic"
- **Journals**: Production and Operations Management, Journal of Operations Management
- **Contribution**: Shows that even with metrics, entrepreneurs lack decision logic for stakeholder prioritization.

---

### Cluster 5 – Belief-Based Model Constraints (Frontier Limitation)
- **Objective**: Reveal that shared or divergent belief models still don’t yield tractable prescriptions.
- **Look for**: Papers on Bayesian entrepreneurship that assume consensus or highlight belief heterogeneity.
- **Keywords**: "subjective priors entrepreneurship", "agree to disagree", "belief heterogeneity startup models"
- **Additional**: Introduce **resource rationality** — show why belief-state models fail under realistic constraints.
- **Journals**: Management Science, Strategic Management Journal, Behavioral and Brain Sciences
- **Contribution**: Demonstrates that belief-based models assume too much cognitive bandwidth or consensus to be useful for real entrepreneurs.

---

### Cluster 6 – OM Integration Gaps (Frontier Limitation)
- **Objective**: Show that OM tools are not integrated or usable without a unifying framework.
- **Look for**: Review papers or POM special issues calling for integrated OM toolkits.
- **Keywords**: "operations for entrepreneurs", "startup decision integration", "OM tool limitations"
- **Journals**: Production and Operations Management, Journal of Operations Management
- **Contribution**: Justifies STRAP by showing that entrepreneurs need integrated, context-aware guidance—not a toolbox of disconnected models.
