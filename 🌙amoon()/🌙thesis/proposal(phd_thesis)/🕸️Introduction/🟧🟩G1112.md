# ðŸŸ§G11 - Core Model Introduction

This research introduces a two-stage integrated model that bridges discrete choice prediction with newsvendor optimization to address entrepreneurial stakeholder prioritization under uncertainty. The **prediction stage** employs discrete choice modeling where product quality (q) generates stakeholder-specific commitment probabilities $P_c(q)$ for customers and $P_r(q)$ for resource partners, extending [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ©_mitchell97_identify(stakeholders, salience)]] stakeholder salience framework to quantitative commitment prediction under entrepreneurial conditions. The **optimization stage** applies newsvendor logic where predicted commitment probabilities drive expected cost minimization across underage costs ($C_u$), overage costs ($C_o$), and matching value ($V$), building on [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ§_vanmieghem02_extend(network,newsvendor)]] multi-product newsvendor networks to handle simultaneous stakeholder relationship management. This integration addresses the systematic bias identified by [[ðŸ“œðŸŸª_busenitz97_recognize(entrepreneurs, biases)]] in entrepreneurial decision-making by providing quantitative decision support that replaces heuristic-driven intuition with structured optimization approaches. The resulting framework demonstrates how operations management principles can enhance entrepreneurial decision-making effectiveness, supporting [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ¦_fine+22_integrate(om-theory, ent-practice)]] call for injecting OM rigor into entrepreneurial practice through mathematically tractable yet contextually relevant modeling approaches that bridge theoretical precision with practical implementation requirements.
