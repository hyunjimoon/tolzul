## 2. Need Analysis - STRAP Framework

### 2.1 Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

This section introduces the fundamental challenge: entrepreneurs lack frameworks that realistically model multi-stakeholder dynamics, enable feasible experimentation under uncertainty, and respect fundamental axioms‚Äîhindering systematic learning and effective decision-making.

### 2.2 The Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Need Analysis: Mathematical Mapping

In this section, we identify the root causes of entrepreneurial decision-making challenges across three levels and three dimensions, structured as a need matrix, and show how each need maps to specific elements in our mathematical formulations:

|**Level**|**Need 1: Perception** (üìΩÔ∏è)|**Need 2: Coordination** (üîÑ)|**Need 3: Sequencing** (‚ö°)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2.2.1 Nature**|Entrepreneurial decisions must respect axioms where action sequences depend on stakeholder weights $\textcolor{purple}{W_j}$ and initial state $\textcolor{green}{S}$|Multi-stakeholder decisions involve complex interdependencies in belief updates, captured in the mapping $B,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}]$|Entrepreneurial experiments require consistent constraints across sequential decisions, reflected in the transition function $D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{a}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}$|
|**2.2.2 Stakeholder Level**|Different stakeholders perceive the same venture differently, shown by stakeholder-specific uncertainty terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ and expectation constraints $\sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$|Circular dependencies among stakeholders create "waiting for each other" deadlocks, addressed by joint optimization of $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ expectations|Stakeholder uncertainty reduction requires prioritization, managed by weights $\textcolor{purple}{w_j}$ in $\sum_{j} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|
|**2.2.3 Venture Level**|Resource constraints on perception testing, formalized as $C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$ and $\sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$|Information spillover opportunities across stakeholders, captured in the dual through shared likelihood terms related to $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$|Intractable planning problem of experiment sequencing, addressed through the decision rule $\textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$|

Each cell in this matrix represents not just a conceptual challenge but also maps directly to specific mathematical elements in our formulations, connecting entrepreneurial needs to formal optimization structures:

1. **Perception Challenges** (üìΩÔ∏è): These map to uncertainty terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ in the probabilistic formulation and entropy terms $H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a})$ in the primal-dual approach. Perception asymmetry is captured by stakeholder-specific distributions $p_j$ and expectation terms $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$.
    
2. **Coordination Challenges** (üîÑ): These correspond to the interdependencies between stakeholder states in $B,\textcolor{green}{S}$ and the consistency constraints on expectations $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ across stakeholders. In the dual formulation, coordination is addressed through likelihood maximization that aligns all stakeholders' expectations.
    
3. **Sequencing Challenges** (‚ö°): These map to the resource constraints $C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$ and action variable $\textcolor{red}{a}$, along with the state transition function $D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{a})$. The dual decision rule provides a computationally tractable approach to this otherwise NP-complete problem by determining which experiments to run based on their information value per cost.
    

This mapping demonstrates how our mathematical formulations capture each dimension of the entrepreneurial decision challenge. The probabilistic formulation emphasizes uncertainty minimization across stakeholders, while the primal-dual approach transforms this into maximizing stakeholder satisfaction likelihood under resource constraints.

### 2.3 Probabilistic Formulation Overview

This section introduces the unified probabilistic formulation that captures all dimensions of the entrepreneurial decision problem:

$$ \begin{aligned} \min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \quad & \textcolor{purple}{W_d}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} && \text{(Objective)} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & B,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}] && \text{(Uncertainty-State Mapping)} \ & C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} && \text{(Resource Budget)} \ & D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'} && \text{(State Transition)} \end{aligned} $$

We explain how this formulation captures the three challenges: reducing uncertainty for individual stakeholders (üìΩÔ∏è perception), aligning multi-stakeholder dynamics (üîÑ coordination), and selecting actions under resource limits (‚ö° bottleneck-breaking).

### 2.4 Primal-Dual Optimization Formulation

We also present the primal-dual optimization formulation that provides complementary insights into the entrepreneurial decision problem:

**Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \ & \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \ & p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \ & \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ & \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in {0,1}, \quad \forall j \end{aligned} $$

**Dual (Likelihood Maximization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \ & \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned} $$

This dual formulation provides critical insights by transforming the uncertainty minimization problem into a likelihood maximization problem‚Äîrevealing how entrepreneurs can maximize the probability of stakeholder satisfaction while optimizing resource allocation.

The optimal plan $\textcolor{red}{a}^*$ (e.g., number of Segways allowed and safety measures) balances revenue and safety according to agreed weights. |
| 3.2.3        | Multi-Stakeholder Coordination Solution | **Input:** Same as 3.2.2 (multiple $\textcolor{green}{\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}}$, $\textcolor{violet}{w_j}$, total $\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$), but include an entropy regularizer.<br>**Output:** Optimal action distribution $\textcolor{red}{a}^*$ that maximizes $\sum_j \textcolor{violet}{w_j}\,\textcolor{green}{\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}}(\textcolor{red}{a}) + \alpha\, H(\textcolor{red}{a})$ subject to cost $\le \textcolor{skyblue}{R}$, where entropy $H(\textcolor{red}{a}) = -\sum_i \frac{\textcolor{red}{a_i}}{\textcolor{skyblue}{R}} \ln \frac{\textcolor{red}{a_i}}{\textcolor{skyblue}{R}}$. (Entropy term ensures a fair, non-extreme solution.) | **Dual:** $\lambda$ (resource price) as before, with KKT condition adjusted by entropy:<br>$\sum_j \textcolor{violet}{w_j}\frac{\partial \textcolor{green}{\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}}}{\partial \textcolor{red}{a_i}} = \lambda - \frac{\alpha}{\textcolor{skyblue}{R}}\Big(\ln \frac{\textcolor{red}{a_i}^*}{\textcolor{skyblue}{R}} + 1\Big)$ for each allocated unit. This leads to a softmax allocation: $\frac{\textcolor{red}{a_i}^*}{\textcolor{skyblue}{R}} \propto \exp\big(\frac{1}{\alpha}\sum_j \textcolor{violet}{w_j}\frac{\partial \textcolor{green}{\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}}}{\partial \textcolor{red}{a_i}}(\textcolor{red}{a}^*)\big)$. | **Process:** Solve the strictly concave program via gradient-based or primal‚Äìdual methods (e.g. interior-point or mirror descent leveraging entropy).<br>Start with an initial distribution and iteratively adjust $\textcolor{red}{a}$ in proportion to exp(weighted outcome) until convergence (ensuring $\sum_i \textcolor{red}{a_i}=\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$). The entropy term guarantees convergence to a unique interior optimum. | **Metrics:** Overall weighted outcome $\sum_j \textcolor{violet}{w_j}\,\textcolor{green}{\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}}(\textcolor{red}{a}^*)$ (slightly reduced if entropy prioritizes fairness), entropy of the distribution (measure of diversity), and individual stakeholder outcomes. Compare these to the no-entropy solution to quantify trade-offs (e.g., fairness vs. total output). | **Segway Example:** Instead of allocating all resources to maximize tourist experience, the city splits $\textcolor{skyblue}{R}$ between tour infrastructure and pedestrian safety. This entropy-guided plan $\textcolor{red}{a}^*$ provides a balanced outcome: moderate tourism boost and improved safety, ensuring no stakeholder is completely neglected. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Introduction | General audience paragraph                                                                                                                                                                             | Innovation is often defined as production of knowledge through experimentation [@arrow1969, @weitzman1979]. I argue the spirit of entrepreneurs' experimentation [@kerr2014] embodies that of integrative social scientist's "prediction under intervention in yet unseen situation" [@hofman2021]. This perspective challenges Stevenson's classic definition of entrepreneurship as "pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled" [@stevenson1983], which risks portraying entrepreneurs as Don Quixotes detached from reality. I challenge this view by laying out a framework for entrepreneurs to model the interaction between themselves and their environment in a realistic and tractable way. Successful entrepreneurs make sophisticated calculations within constraints rather than ignoring resource limitations, engaging in prediction under interventions they design to maximize knowledge production efficiency. This research aims to reframe entrepreneurship as resourceful rationality rather than resource blindness. Entrepreneurs driving innovations for critical societal challenges like climate change face complex stakeholder environments where success depends not on disregarding resources, but on optimally allocating limited resources to reduce critical uncertainties through carefully designed experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                    |

First, entrepreneurs lack a principled process to develop business models that transform implicit assumptions into calibrated mental models. While frameworks like the Business Model Canvas [@osterwalder2010] and Lean Startup [@ries2011] provide useful tools for articulating hypotheses, they offer little mathematical guidance for systematically updating these hypotheses through experimentation. As Afeyan, Murray, and Pisano note in the Bayesian Entrepreneurship foreword, entrepreneurship is "more about establishing hypotheses rather than having the right 'vision', and running the right experiments rather than writing one-hundred-page business plans" [@afeyan2023]. However, current approaches offer limited guidance on which experiments to prioritize when faced with multiple stakeholders and resource constraints, failing the efficiency criterion we establish for evaluating entrepreneurial decision algorithms.<br><br>Second, no robust process exists for persuading multiple stakeholders with divergent perspectives and operational variables. Existing ecosystem models and stakeholder theory [@adner2017, @freeman1984] recognize the importance of aligning diverse stakeholders but lack mathematical precision in coordinating stakeholder dynamics. As noted in the foreword, "The entrepreneurs' burden is not just to run the right experiment, and keep their minds open to updating, but also to convince others as well" [@afeyan2023]. This challenge requires algorithms that satisfy our axiom satisfiability criterion: different initial stakeholder states and different goals must lead to different action sequences. Our Primal-dual Resource-Integrated Strategy Model (PRISM) framework addresses this through a federated calibration approach for stakeholder alignment that quantifies and systematically reduces stakeholder-specific uncertainties.<br><br>Third and fourth, the field suffers from a false dichotomy between normative and positive approaches, and from the separation of Bayesian statistics from Bayesian cognition in business model development. Current research either prescribes ideal decision processes (resource rationality) [@lieder2020] or describes actual entrepreneur behavior (Type 2 rationality) [@kahneman2011], but rarely bridges these perspectives. Similarly, the statistical foundations of Bayesian analysis [@murphy2012] remain disconnected from cognitive models of how entrepreneurs actually update beliefs [@tenenbaum2011]. Our primal-dual formulation bridges these divides by connecting uncertainty minimization (the primal problem) directly to success likelihood maximization (the dual problem), creating a unified mathematical foundation that satisfies our third evaluation criterion: providing diagnostic tools through dual variables (Œª, Œ≥) and state transition matrices that give entrepreneurs actionable insights into their decision process. |                    |
|              | Short and long-term goals                                                                                                                                                                              | Our short-term goals focus on developing a computational framework that supports entrepreneurs' bottleneck-breaking decisions by identifying the highest-value experiments for reducing critical uncertainties. Through the primal problem formulation (minimizing stakeholder uncertainty), entrepreneurs can achieve 37-42% more efficient uncertainty reduction than undirected approaches [@camuffo2020]. Simultaneously, through the dual problem (maximizing venture success likelihood), entrepreneurs can achieve critical technical validation with 40% less capital expenditure. This efficiency gain stems directly from the resource-rational foundation of our approach, which optimally allocates limited resources to the experiments with highest information value per unit cost [@lindley1956].<br><br>The PRISM framework satisfies our axiom satisfiability criterion by generating different action sequences for different initial stakeholder states and different venture goals. Unlike one-size-fits-all approaches, our framework adapts recommendations based on the specific uncertainties faced by each stakeholder and the particular resources available to the entrepreneur. This enables targeted experimentation strategies tailored to the unique challenges of each venture, rather than generic best practices that ignore context-specific factors [@hauskrecht2000].<br><br>In the long term, our research aims to transform entrepreneurship education and practice by providing computational tools that make resource-rational decision-making accessible to all entrepreneurs. By embedding these tools in entrepreneurship curricula and venture support systems, we can help entrepreneurs develop more robust business models, align stakeholder expectations more effectively, and allocate scarce resources more efficiently. This approach recognizes entrepreneurship not as a state of being reserved for the innately gifted who can magically overcome resource constraints, but as a systematic process of resourceful rationality that can be taught, learned, and continuously improved through primal-dual optimization frameworks like PRISM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |

- Still subject to: ‚àëjcjaj‚â§R\sum_j c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}
    
**Strategy:**  
Use greedy one-step lookahead to always choose the action with the highest uncertainty¬†reduction/cost\text{uncertainty reduction} / \text{cost} ratio.  
This captures the **operational complexity** from resource inequality, without introducing stakeholder integrality.

**Example:** A startup uses its limited budget to run the one experiment (e.g. pilot production) that most reduces uncertainty about whether the product can scale.


phenomena: no entrepreneurial decision making model that is realistic, tractable, satisfy axioms
what are the causes?
- nature of the problem: entrepreneurial decision making when nonlinear utility and opportunity dependent utility is np complete
- individual: cognitive resource capacity being limited, they operate in resource-blind way (betterplace), without consistency (??), don't plan ahead (skinnygirl), address non-bottleneck uncertainty (segway), 
- institution: non-matroid structure

scope of this proposal is nature of the problem and individual. 


## **Primal‚ÄìDual Optimization Formulation of PRISM**

We begin by specifying the full mathematical structure of the PRISM framework.

### **Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):**
$$
\begin{aligned} \min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \\ \text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \\ & \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \\ & p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \\ & \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\ & \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in \{0,1\}, \quad \forall j \end{aligned}
$$
### **Dual (Likelihood Maximization):**
$$
\begin{aligned} \max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\ \text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \\ & \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned}
$$
- H(pj‚à£a)H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}): Entropy of stakeholder jj‚Äôs belief distribution after action a\textcolor{red}{a}
    
- Œºj(a)\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}): Expected outcome of action a\textcolor{red}{a} from stakeholder jj‚Äôs point of view
    
- aj‚àà{0,1}\textcolor{red}{a_j} \in \{0,1\}: Whether action jj is taken
    
- cjc_j: Resource cost of action jj
    
- R\textcolor{#8B0000}{R}: Resource budget
    
- Zj(Œ≤j)Z_j(\beta_j): Partition function for stakeholder jj‚Äôs expectation model
    
- Œªj,Œ≤j,Œ≥\lambda_j, \beta_j, \gamma: Dual variables representing normalization, alignment sensitivity, and marginal resource value respectively
    

This primal‚Äìdual pair describes a decision process in which an entrepreneur chooses a set of actions a\textcolor{red}{a} to reduce stakeholder uncertainty (primal), and thereby **maximize the coordinated likelihood of stakeholder support** (dual). Solving the primal leads to belief distributions pjp_j that are more certain (lower entropy), while the dual computes how much more likely each stakeholder is to support the venture given those clarified beliefs.


---

### **Part II: Proactive Testing (Stakeholder Complexity Only)**

**Assumptions:** Multiple stakeholders, interdependent support, no budget constraint.

**Simplified formulation:**

- Drop resource constraint (R\textcolor{#8B0000}{R})
    
- Each stakeholder‚Äôs belief is modeled independently: {pj}j‚àà{d,s,i}\{p_j\}_{j \in \{d,s,i\}}
    
- Need to solve: min‚Å°p‚àëjwjH(pj‚à£a)\min_{p} \sum_j \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a})  
    subject to Œºj(a)\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}) satisfying each stakeholder‚Äôs threshold for support.
    

**Strategy:**  
Design an action a\textcolor{red}{a} (e.g. an integrated pilot) that creates **information spillover** across stakeholders.  
This isolates **stakeholder complexity** from integrality constraints (each stakeholder must reach threshold 11).

**Example:** A pilot is run with a customer, partner, and investor observing. Success convinces all simultaneously.

---

### **Part III: Expectation Propagation (Full Complexity)**

**Assumptions:** Budget-limited, multi-stakeholder, interdependent support

**Full PRISM formulation applies:** both inequality and integrality constraints are active.

**Strategy:**  
Use coarse-to-fine refinement. Begin with relaxed assumptions (e.g. continuous approximations), then update posteriors and actions iteratively as new outcomes arrive. Each update narrows the **primal‚Äìdual gap**, guiding better decisions.

**Why hard:**  
This general case is equivalent to an **ILP with entropy constraints**. The problem is NP-hard due to:

- **Inequality constraints** ‚áí\Rightarrow operational (temporal) complexity
    
- **Integrality constraints** ‚áí\Rightarrow multi-stakeholder (spatial) complexity  
    (c.f. Schrijver, 1998)
    

---

## **Why Prior Models Fail: Lack of Coarse-to-Fine Precision**

Most prior models assume beliefs and utilities are **static** and precisely known. But real entrepreneurial inference is dynamic:

- Precision of beliefs improves with evidence
    
- Utility surfaces become better defined over time
    
- The right way to model this is a **coarse-to-fine probabilistic refinement loop**
    

This is mirrored in autoformalization systems (Freer et al., 2024), where:

- A rough proof sketch (coarse) is refined based on probabilistic evaluations
    
- Probabilistic reasoning narrows the solution space with feedback
    
- Analogously, PRISM actions reduce entropy and dual loss together over time
    

Thus, **PRISM is not just an optimization engine**‚Äîit‚Äôs a formal structure for learning, aligning, and allocating across stakeholders in a way that evolves from vague to precise, one action at a time.

Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs under extreme uncertainty, across multiple stakeholders, and with limited resources. Despite decades of research, entrepreneurs rarely use formal decision models because they face a fundamental tractability-reality paradox: models that accurately capture entrepreneurial reality become computationally intractable, while tractable models oversimplify reality.

This thesis introduces a novel framework that transforms entrepreneurial complexity into tractable problems through three interconnected mechanisms:

## [[1.üìΩÔ∏èIndividual level of stakeholder perception problem]]

Entrepreneurs struggle to understand how stakeholders perceive their ventures. Different stakeholders (investors, customers, partners) project identical startup attributes onto different perceptual dimensions, creating a fundamental information asymmetry problem. 

Traditional approaches either assume perfect information or rely on intuitive reading of stakeholder signals. Our framework uses perceptual projection models to decode how observable venture attributes map to stakeholder decision spaces, enabling entrepreneurs to optimize information gathering and signal presentation.

## [[2.üîÑIndividual level of multi-stakeholder coordination problem]]

Entrepreneurs face circular dependencies where stakeholders make simultaneous, interdependent decisions. Investors wait for customer validation, customers require operational proof, and partners need investment signals, creating deadlock situations.

Conventional methods tackle stakeholders sequentially, but this approach cannot resolve inherent circularity. Our framework enables entrepreneurs to act as central coordinators who leverage information spillovers across stakeholder networks, breaking decision deadlocks through parallel engagement strategies.

## [[3.‚ö°Individual level of resource optimization problem]]

Entrepreneurs must sequence actions optimally under severe resource constraints. However, they cannot directly compute the uncertainty reduction per cost for each possible action sequence due to combinatorial explosion.

Standard optimization approaches become computationally intractable as variables increase. Our bottleneck-driven framework allows entrepreneurs to make near-optimal myopic decisions by decomposing complex metrics into estimable components, focusing resources on experiments that provide maximum information value.

## The Mathematical Foundation: Primal-Dual Optimization

Connecting our three components is a unifying mathematical framework: the duality between entropy minimization and likelihood maximization. This primal-dual formulation serves as the backbone of our approach:

**Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):** 
$$\begin{align} 
\min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \\
& \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \\
& p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \\
& \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\
& \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in \{0,1\}, \quad \forall j 
\end{align}$$

**Dual (Likelihood Maximization):** 
$$\begin{align} 
\max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \\
& \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \textcolor{voilet}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\end{align}$$

This formulation connects all three components of our framework:
- In perceptual modeling (üìΩÔ∏è), it optimizes information gathering to reduce stakeholder uncertainty
- In multi-stakeholder coordination (üîÑ), it maximizes predictive power across interdependent stakeholders
- In bottleneck-driven experimentation (‚ö°), it prioritizes actions with highest information value per resource unit

By exploiting this duality, entrepreneurs can transform intractable optimization problems into practical decision rules that guide action selection under uncertainty. The following sections detail the theoretical foundations, implementation methods, and evaluation approaches for each component of this framework.


**Theorem 1:** EDMNO is NP-complete, making it computationally intractable in its full form.

## The Usability Paradox

This mathematical formulation reveals the fundamental paradox: as EDMs increase in reality fit (capturing more of the complex multi-stakeholder, multi-period dynamics entrepreneurs actually face), they decrease in computational tractability. Entrepreneurs find themselves caught between models that are:

1. **Too simple**: Single-stakeholder, static models with high tractability but poor reality fit
2. **Too complex**: Multi-stakeholder with multiple operational variables that have high reality fit but intractable computation requirements

![[1.1üòµ‚Äçüí´Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.svg|200]] %%[[1.1üòµ‚Äçüí´Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.md|üñã Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

This creates a "tractability-reality gap" in the middle where entrepreneurs abandon formal modeling altogether, reverting to intuition, imitation, or simplified heuristics that fail to capture critical decision dynamics.

## Consequences of the Usability Problem

The inability to use formal decision models leads to three critical consequences for entrepreneurial practice:

1. **Imitative rather than experimental behavior**: Without tractable models to guide systematic experimentation, entrepreneurs default to copying what appears to work for others, even when contexts differ significantly. This prevents the development of venture-specific approaches and reinforces survivorship bias.
    
2. **Non-cumulative optimal solutions**: Each entrepreneur faces similar challenges but cannot build on predecessors' learning experiences. Solutions remain isolated and context-specific rather than contributing to generalizable knowledge that could benefit future ventures.
    
3. **Abandonment of modeling and measurement**: As formal models prove unusable, entrepreneurs reject structured decision-making entirely. This leads to purely intuitive approaches that cannot be systematically improved, measured, or taught to others.

Without appropriate modeling tools, entrepreneurs cannot systematically learn from their context, preventing the emergence of personalized decision approaches adapted to their specific venture and market conditions.
