### **1: Core Theoretical Contribution**

STRAP advances entrepreneurial decision theo
ry by demonstrating that optimal stakeholder sequencing emerges from systematic uncertainty optimization rather than intuitive prioritization heuristics, revealing two counterintuitive effects that challenge conventional entrepreneurship wisdom. The framework's **Probability Effect** shows that entrepreneurs should pursue stakeholders with higher direct costs when their acceptance probability sufficiently outweighs alternatives—such as investing in expensive technical validation when resource partner success probability significantly exceeds customer acceptance likelihood despite higher upfront costs. This theoretical contribution systematically contradicts generic "customer-first" prescriptions by establishing that stakeholder sequencing depends fundamentally on asymmetric cost structures moderated by interdependence effects, where securing one stakeholder type enhances others' acceptance probabilities. Unlike existing frameworks that treat stakeholder interactions independently, STRAP transforms multi-stakeholder engagement from ad hoc relationship management into rigorous operations-theoretic optimization, establishing stakeholder sequencing as a distinct theoretical domain requiring mathematical rather than purely strategic analysis.

### 2: Entrepreneurial Operations - Remaining Limitations

STRAP's operational implementation confronts fundamental information asymmetries in cost parameter estimation that create significant barriers to systematic decision-theoretic framework adoption across entrepreneurial contexts. The precise quantification of overage costs (Co) and underage costs (Cu) requires synthesizing industry-specific penalty structures, supply chain benchmarking data, and multi-period reputation damage assessments that individual entrepreneurs rarely possess, as demonstrated by our Redwood Materials analysis where calculating the $120M underage cost necessitated understanding automotive OEM penalty mechanisms, competitive displacement dynamics, and reputation quantification across technical domains. Similarly, accurate probability estimation for stakeholder acceptance (pc, pr, prc, pcr) demands data collection and analytical capabilities that exceed typical entrepreneurial resources, particularly when stakeholder preferences exhibit temporal volatility or context-dependent variations that resist stable probabilistic modeling. These information requirements create systematic implementation barriers where theoretical optimization insights remain practically inaccessible without institutional support infrastructure.

### **3: Entrepreneurial Operations - Institutional Solutions**

The operational barriers identified above necessitate systematic institutional infrastructure development that democratizes access to sophisticated entrepreneurial decision frameworks through standardized information provision and computational support systems. Accelerators, industry associations, and government agencies could develop sector-specific cost benchmarking databases and parameter estimation tools that transform entrepreneur-specific cost calculations from intractable optimization problems into systematic, data-driven processes, paralleling existing venture capital due diligence frameworks and Small Business Administration resource programs. Such institutional infrastructure would provide dynamic parameter adjustment capabilities that enable real-time strategic recalibration as environmental conditions, customer preferences, technical innovations, industry structures, business cycles, and capital market conditions evolve, creating adaptive guidance mechanisms accessible without extensive operations research expertise. This institutional role represents a novel contribution to entrepreneurship policy research, suggesting that systematic decision framework adoption requires coordinated ecosystem development rather than individual entrepreneur education, positioning cost parameter transparency as fundamental infrastructure comparable to capital market development in supporting innovation ecosystem effectiveness.

### **4: Entrepreneurial Strategy - Remaining Limitations**

STRAP's strategic implementation encounters two fundamental challenges that limit systematic stakeholder identification and state variable measurement across diverse entrepreneurial contexts and venture development stages. The framework assumes entrepreneurs can systematically categorize stakeholders into customer versus resource partner classifications, yet early-stage ventures often operate in ambiguous stakeholder landscapes where potential partners serve multiple roles simultaneously or exhibit unclear commitment patterns that resist binary classification schemes. Furthermore, measuring stakeholder acceptance through binary state variables (committed/uncommitted) oversimplifies complex relationship dynamics where acceptance exists along continuous spectrums with multiple intermediate states representing partial commitments, conditional agreements, or evolving engagement levels that significantly influence optimal sequencing decisions. The probability estimation requirements for interdependent stakeholder acceptance create additional strategic complexity when stakeholder preferences exhibit heterogeneity, temporal evolution, or context-dependent variations that challenge stable probabilistic modeling assumptions essential for systematic optimization.

### **5: Entrepreneurial Strategy - Taxonomic Solutions**

Strategic implementation barriers can be systematically addressed through structured stakeholder categorization frameworks and behavioral prediction models that transform ambiguous relationship landscapes into actionable decision variables for optimal sequencing strategies. A comprehensive taxonomic approach encompassing Technology (tools, techniques, designs, knowledge), Organization (capabilities, resources, team compositions, cultural elements), Product (designs, features, attributes), Customer (persons, groups, organizations), and Competitor (firms providing similar solutions) enables systematic stakeholder mapping while recognizing that individual entities may occupy multiple categories simultaneously, reducing identification ambiguity through structured classification. State variable measurement challenges can be operationalized through nested logit models that capture intermediate acceptance states by mapping observable stakeholder attributes—such as investment stage, sector expertise, decision-making timeline, and risk tolerance—to behavioral prediction probabilities, enabling entrepreneurs to systematically forecast how specific stakeholder characteristics translate into acceptance likelihood and then prescribe optimal engagement sequences based on these predictions. This behavior prediction → action prescription pipeline transforms strategic stakeholder selection from intuitive relationship management into systematic optimization, providing entrepreneurs with implementable frameworks for translating stakeholder heterogeneity into actionable strategic guidance.

### **6: Bridging Operations and Strategy - Cognitive Limitations and Computational Solutions**

The integration of operational efficiency with strategic stakeholder coordination confronts fundamental limitations in belief-state modeling approaches that constrain entrepreneurs' cognitive capacity for complex multi-dimensional optimization under uncertainty and resource constraints. Current Bayesian entrepreneurship approaches remain constrained by belief-state modeling assumptions that require entrepreneurs to maintain and update complex probability distributions over stakeholder preferences, yet entrepreneurs systematically deviate from rational behavior due to "innate restricted computational capacities, access to information, and physical constraints" that prevent effective belief-state management in practice. Future theoretical development should transition from bounded rationality frameworks (which assume systematic cognitive errors) toward bounded optimality approaches that recognize entrepreneurs make optimal decisions given computational constraints, potentially through sampling-based decision mechanisms that avoid belief-state modeling entirely—such as "one and done" voting systems where entrepreneurs make stakeholder sequencing decisions based on sampled yes/no responses rather than maintaining complex probability distributions. This computational approach would extend STRAP's theoretical foundation while acknowledging practical realities of entrepreneurial decision-making, suggesting machine learning implementations that provide decision support through simplified heuristic frameworks or automated stakeholder behavior prediction systems that minimize cognitive load while preserving systematic optimization benefits.

## 5. Conclusion
This research establishes stakeholder sequencing as a fundamental theoretical domain within entrepreneurial decision-making, demonstrating how systematic uncertainty optimization can resolve longstanding tensions between resource development and market validation strategies. By synthesizing inventory optimization theory with multi-stakeholder venture dynamics, STRAP transcends the artificial dichotomy between "capability-first" and "customer-first" approaches that has constrained entrepreneurship theory for decades. Our framework reveals two counterintuitive effects—the Probability Effect and Interdependence Effect—that systematically contradict conventional wisdom, showing when entrepreneurs should pursue lower-probability stakeholders or higher-cost engagements to optimize expected outcomes.

The theoretical implications extend far beyond stakeholder management into the foundations of entrepreneurial cognition and strategic decision-making under uncertainty. Our transition from belief-state modeling toward bounded optimality approaches addresses fundamental limitations in current Bayesian entrepreneurship frameworks, suggesting that entrepreneurs' systematic deviations from rational behavior reflect computational constraints rather than cognitive failures. This reconceptualization opens new research territories connecting operations research, behavioral economics, and entrepreneurship theory through computational frameworks that preserve analytical rigor while acknowledging practical decision-making realities.

The institutional implications of our findings suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystem development requires systematic information infrastructure comparable to capital market institutions in supporting venture success. By demonstrating how cost parameter transparency and stakeholder behavior prediction can be operationalized through institutional intermediaries, this research provides a blueprint for evidence-based entrepreneurship policy that moves beyond generic advice toward context-specific, quantitatively-informed decision support. The framework's capacity to transform complex multi-stakeholder uncertainty into actionable decision rules represents a fundamental advance in translating theoretical insights into practical entrepreneurial capabilities, establishing new standards for systematic venture development in high-uncertainty environments.
