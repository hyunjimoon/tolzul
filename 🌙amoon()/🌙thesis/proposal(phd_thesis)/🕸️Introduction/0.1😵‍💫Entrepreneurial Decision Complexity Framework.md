Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs under extreme uncertainty, across multiple stakeholders, and with limited resources. Despite decades of research, entrepreneurs rarely use formal decision models because they face a fundamental tractability-reality paradox: models that accurately capture entrepreneurial reality become computationally intractable, while tractable models oversimplify reality.

This thesis introduces a novel framework that transforms entrepreneurial complexity into tractable problems through three interconnected mechanisms:

## [[1.üìΩÔ∏èIndividual level of stakeholder perception problem]]

Entrepreneurs struggle to understand how stakeholders perceive their ventures. Different stakeholders (investors, customers, partners) project identical startup attributes onto different perceptual dimensions, creating a fundamental information asymmetry problem. 

Traditional approaches either assume perfect information or rely on intuitive reading of stakeholder signals. Our framework uses perceptual projection models to decode how observable venture attributes map to stakeholder decision spaces, enabling entrepreneurs to optimize information gathering and signal presentation.

## [[2.üîÑIndividual level of multi-stakeholder coordination problem]]

Entrepreneurs face circular dependencies where stakeholders make simultaneous, interdependent decisions. Investors wait for customer validation, customers require operational proof, and partners need investment signals, creating deadlock situations.

Conventional methods tackle stakeholders sequentially, but this approach cannot resolve inherent circularity. Our framework enables entrepreneurs to act as central coordinators who leverage information spillovers across stakeholder networks, breaking decision deadlocks through parallel engagement strategies.

## [[3.‚ö°Individual level of resource optimization problem]]

Entrepreneurs must sequence actions optimally under severe resource constraints. However, they cannot directly compute the uncertainty reduction per cost for each possible action sequence due to combinatorial explosion.

Standard optimization approaches become computationally intractable as variables increase. Our bottleneck-driven framework allows entrepreneurs to make near-optimal myopic decisions by decomposing complex metrics into estimable components, focusing resources on experiments that provide maximum information value.

## The Mathematical Foundation: Primal-Dual Optimization

Connecting our three components is a unifying mathematical framework: the duality between entropy minimization and likelihood maximization. This primal-dual formulation serves as the backbone of our approach:

**Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):** 
$$\begin{align} 
\min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \\
& \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \\
& p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \\
& \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\
& \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in \{0,1\}, \quad \forall j 
\end{align}$$

**Dual (Likelihood Maximization):** 
$$\begin{align} 
\max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in \{d,s,i\}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \mu_j(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \\
& \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \mu_j(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\end{align}$$

This formulation connects all three components of our framework:
- In perceptual modeling (üìΩÔ∏è), it optimizes information gathering to reduce stakeholder uncertainty
- In multi-stakeholder coordination (üîÑ), it maximizes predictive power across interdependent stakeholders
- In bottleneck-driven experimentation (‚ö°), it prioritizes actions with highest information value per resource unit

By exploiting this duality, entrepreneurs can transform intractable optimization problems into practical decision rules that guide action selection under uncertainty. The following sections detail the theoretical foundations, implementation methods, and evaluation approaches for each component of this framework.

Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs under extreme uncertainty, across multiple stakeholders, and in a sequence-dependent environment. While numerous formal models (EDMs) exist in the academic literature, entrepreneurs rarely apply them, resulting in a persistent gap between theoretical advances and practical usage. This section formalizes that gap as a tractability-reality paradox: models with high reality fit (multiple stakeholders, operations, and time steps) become computationally intractable (NP-complete), while tractable models fail to capture entrepreneurial realities.

We define this central problem through the EDMNO formulation:

$$
\arg\min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \textcolor{purple}{W_d} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad B\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}], \quad C\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}, \quad D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}
$$

Each component reflects a different modeling dimension. entrepreneurs operate not to maximize utility, but to minimize stakeholder-specific uncertainties in sequence during early stage as they don't have profit function. We propose that usable models must focus on this milestone-based uncertainty reduction logic. Instead of assuming entrepreneurs are passive recipients of externally built models, we treat them as cognitive agents capable of engaging with structured, simplified representations that reduce residual uncertainty across three stakeholder dimensions (ambiguity in action selection). The goal of the thesis is to build such tractable mid-complexity frameworks.

**Variables:**
- $\textcolor{red}{A}$: actions (segment, collaborate, capitalize)    
- $\textcolor{green}{S}$: stakeholder acceptance state (e.g., [0,1,0])
- $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$: residual uncertainties per stakeholder
- $\textcolor{purple}{W}$: stakeholder importance weights; $\textcolor{purple}{W_D}$, $\textcolor{purple}{W_S}$, $\textcolor{purple}{W_C}$: weights for demand-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_D}$), supply-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_S}$), and capital-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_C}$) uncertainty.
- $C$: maps actions to cost
- $B$: maps state to stakeholder uncertainty
- $D$: maps current state and action to next state

**Constraints:**
   * $B \, \textcolor{green}{S} = \textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$: Relates the current **state** $\textcolor{green}{S}$ to the level of uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$. (**B:** How the current state directly translates into uncertainty levels.)
   * $C \, \textcolor{red}{A} = R$: Relates chosen **actions** $\textcolor{red}{A}$ to **resources or costs** $R$. (**C:** Cost or resource implications of actions taken.)
   * $D \, \textcolor{red}{A} \, \textcolor{green}{S} = 0$: Captures dynamics ensuring actions and states are consistent (no internal contradictions in decision-state combinations). (**D:** Dynamic consistency‚Äîensuring chosen actions make sense given the current states.)

## The Fundamental Challenge

Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs in environments characterized by extreme uncertainty, multi-stakeholder interactions, and sequence-dependent outcomes. Despite decades of academic research developing entrepreneurial decision models (EDMs), practicing entrepreneurs rarely adopt these models in their actual decision processes. This creates a troubling gap between theory and practice that undermines both entrepreneurial success and scholarly advancement.

## Mathematical Formulation of the Problem

At its core, the Entrepreneurial Decision Model for Navigating Outcomes (EDMNO) can be mathematically represented as:

**Definition (EDMNO):** Given rational matrices $A_t$ ($N \times M$) and $R_t$ ($N \times P$), rational vectors $b_t$ ($M$) and $c_t$ ($P$) for $t \in 1, \ldots, T$, a set of opportunity states $\textcolor{blue}{\Omega} = {\textcolor{blue}{\omega_1}, \ldots, \textcolor{blue}{\omega_Q}}$, a non-additive uncertainty function $\textcolor{blue}{U}: \mathbb{R}^{P \times T} \times \textcolor{blue}{\Omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a rational number $L$, does there exist a sequence of integral vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_T$ (each of length $N$) such that $A_tx_t \leq b_t$ for all $t$, and $\textcolor{blue}{U}({R_tx_t - c_t}_{t=1}^T, \textcolor{blue}{\omega}) \leq L$ for some $\textcolor{blue}{\omega} \in \textcolor{blue}{\Omega}$, where $\textcolor{blue}{U}$ is non-additive in its first argument and represents uncertainty to be minimized?

	This can be simplified to our working notation:

**Theorem 1:** EDMNO is NP-complete, making it computationally intractable in its full form.

## The Usability Paradox

This mathematical formulation reveals the fundamental paradox: as EDMs increase in reality fit (capturing more of the complex multi-stakeholder, multi-period dynamics entrepreneurs actually face), they decrease in computational tractability. Entrepreneurs find themselves caught between models that are:

1. **Too simple**: Single-stakeholder, static models with high tractability but poor reality fit
2. **Too complex**: Multi-stakeholder with multiple operational variables that have high reality fit but intractable computation requirements

![[1.1üòµ‚Äçüí´Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.svg|200]] %%[[1.1üòµ‚Äçüí´Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.md|üñã Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

This creates a "tractability-reality gap" in the middle where entrepreneurs abandon formal modeling altogether, reverting to intuition, imitation, or simplified heuristics that fail to capture critical decision dynamics.

## Consequences of the Usability Problem

The inability to use formal decision models leads to three critical consequences for entrepreneurial practice:

1. **Imitative rather than experimental behavior**: Without tractable models to guide systematic experimentation, entrepreneurs default to copying what appears to work for others, even when contexts differ significantly. This prevents the development of venture-specific approaches and reinforces survivorship bias.
    
2. **Non-cumulative optimal solutions**: Each entrepreneur faces similar challenges but cannot build on predecessors' learning experiences. Solutions remain isolated and context-specific rather than contributing to generalizable knowledge that could benefit future ventures.
    
3. **Abandonment of modeling and measurement**: As formal models prove unusable, entrepreneurs reject structured decision-making entirely. This leads to purely intuitive approaches that cannot be systematically improved, measured, or taught to others.

Without appropriate modeling tools, entrepreneurs cannot systematically learn from their context, preventing the emergence of personalized decision approaches adapted to their specific venture and market conditions.
