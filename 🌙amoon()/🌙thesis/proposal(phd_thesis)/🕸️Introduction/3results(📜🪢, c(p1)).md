After summarizing the decision rules derived from [[2methods(📜🪢, s(p1))]], we use retrospective analysis. Intention is to illustrate the process of formulating and solving the optimization problem which includes 1) calculation of overage and underage cost, 2) judging the type of situation they are in (how stochastic or interdependent) to make them confident in applying our proposed theory in their decision analysis (for academics) or decision making (practitioners). To refrain from making (incorrect) normative suggestions of past situation where we lack information access, we changed the first name of each company: from webvan, tesla, betterplace to xeban, sesla, cetterplace. 


# 3. STRAP Decision Framework and Illustrative Cases

To make STRAP’s insights concrete, we present a **decision map** that entrepreneurs can use to determine their strategic “zone,” and we apply it to the cases of Tesla (Roadster program), Better Place, and Webvan. These examples epitomize the cost consequences of sequencing errors and the potential benefits had STRAP been applied.
- **Better Place (Battery Swap Infrastructure, 2007–2013):** _Actual approach:_ **Supplier-Extreme.** Better Place built an extensive network of battery swap stations (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0)) well before securing sufficient EV customers, leading to an (1,0) _failed_ state – the company went bankrupt after burning through ~$850M. No meaningful customer base ever materialized ((0,1) was never reached before collapse). _STRAP analysis:_ Better Place’s underage cost $C_u$ (the missed opportunity of not having infrastructure if EV demand surged unexpectedly) was relatively small – perhaps some foregone early market, on the order of tens of millions. In stark contrast, the overage cost $C_o$ of all that infrastructure was enormous (hundreds of millions). Thus its $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u+C_o}$ was near 0.06, **deep in the “customer-first” zone**. STRAP would have recommended a **customer validation first** sequence: (0,0) → (0,1) by gauging real demand (e.g. piloting with a small fleet of EVs or securing commitments from drivers/companies), and only then investing in scaling infrastructure → (1,1). This staged approach might have saved on the order of $650M+ in upfront investment, deploying capital incrementally as adoption proved out. It could have prevented Better Place’s oversized bet and ultimate write-off.

- **Webvan (Online Groceries, 1996–2001):** _Actual approach:_ **Both-Extreme (Over-ambitious scaling).** Webvan simultaneously attempted to build out supply capacity in multiple cities and stimulate demand, effectively going to (1,0) in a big way (26 massive automated warehouses) and assuming it would quickly get to (1,1*) “hyperscale.” In reality, after launch many warehouses remained severely underutilized (a quasi-(1,0) state persisted), and while some customers came ((1,1) in a few markets), the economics were abysmal – the venture soon collapsed, reverting to (0,0). Over $1B was spent on infrastructure that far outpaced demand. _STRAP analysis:_ Webvan’s underage cost $C_u$ might be construed as the “missed market opportunity” of not being first-mover in online groceries – sizable in theory (they feared losing the race), but arguably much smaller than the overage cost $C_o$ of premature expansion (automated warehouses costing $35M each and $125M/quarter in overhead). Indeed, Webvan did **no serious consumer testing** of its model before scaling, a critical misstep. We estimate a critical ratio on the order of $r \approx 0.30$ for Webvan (still firmly <0.5), indicating **customer-first**. STRAP would have suggested _“customer validation then scale”_: start in one city with a modest, low-capex operation to verify demand and unit economics ((0,0) → (0,1) small scale), adjust the model, and only build advanced warehouses once consistent demand was proven ((1,1) in one market, then carefully expand). This could have saved perhaps $1B by scaling with proven economics rather than blindly building capacity for theoretical demand. Webvan’s fate exemplifies how _overestimating demand and undervaluing overage costs_ leads to catastrophe – exactly what STRAP’s disciplined ratio aims to prevent.

- **Tesla Roadster (Electric Sports Car, 2006–2008):** _Actual approach:_ **Customer-First (with costly scrambling).** Tesla in its early days focused on proving market demand for EVs. They took deposits from customers and hyped the Roadster (effectively moving to (0,1) – hundreds of customers committed with minimal product ready) Meanwhile, they struggled to finalize the supply chain and production. The first units faced delays and quality issues, and Tesla had to make design changes on the fly. As a result, to deliver Roadsters to waiting customers, Tesla incurred approximately **$3.8M in expedited air freight** and other emergency measures (an underage cost) when the planned outsourced production had bottlenecks. Eventually Tesla achieved (1,1), delivering about 500 Roadsters and proving demand for premium EVs, but not without this underage penalty. _STRAP analysis:_ For the Roadster, one can estimate $C_u$ as the cost of disappointing early customers or delaying deliveries (multi-million-dollar rush costs, plus some reputation risk), and $C_o$ as the hypothetical cost if they had built more capacity than needed (in Tesla’s case, they actually had more demand than supply at first – so the idle capacity risk was low, perhaps $2–3M worth of extra capacity would have been the worst-case). This yields a critical ratio roughly $r \approx 0.60$. **Tesla’s scenario lies in the “supplier-first” zone (CR > 0.5)**. STRAP would have recommended securing more of the supply chain upfront ((0,0) → (1,0) on a small scale) before accepting so many customer orders, thus avoiding the pricey last-minute fixes. In practice, Tesla’s resource constraints forced a bit of a customer-first approach – they needed the customer deposits for cash. Nevertheless, once they experienced those underage costs, Tesla adjusted for later models. Notably, for the Model 3, Tesla did both: they **took 400,000+ preorders** to validate mass-market demand _and_ simultaneously invested in the Gigafactory to secure battery supply, a balanced approach reflecting STRAP logic.

Figure situates these cases on the STRAP decision map. The top panel shows the **Critical Ratio Decision Framework**, dividing the strategy space into a _Supplier-First Zone (blue, $r>0.5$)_ and a _Customer-First Zone (green, $r<0.5$)_. Each venture is plotted by its estimated $r$: Tesla around 0.60 in the supplier-first zone (blue point), Webvan ~0.30 and Better Place ~0.06 in the customer-first zone (green points). The actual approaches taken are noted (Tesla actually went more customer-first, Webvan “both-extreme,” Better Place supplier-first extreme) along with the costs incurred. The middle panel illustrates **state transition sequences** and cost outcomes for each case: Tesla’s actual path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) incurred an underage cost of $3.8M, whereas STRAP would have suggested (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1) avoiding that cost; Better Place’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 0,0 failure) cost $850M and could have been replaced by a STRAP path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) with staged growth; Webvan’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1* → 0,0 collapse) burned through $1B, whereas STRAP would advise (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) scaling only after validation.The bottom panel distills the **STRAP decision logic** with definitions: it emphasizes that when _underage costs dominate (disappointing customers is costlier)_ – i.e. high $r$, supplier-first is optimal; when _overage costs dominate (wasted resources are costlier)_ – low $r$, customer-first is optimal. Each case’s numbers exemplify these situations. The key formula $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ is provided as a handy guide. Together, these visuals serve as a quick reference for entrepreneurs to categorize their venture and glean the recommended sequencing strategy at a glance.
