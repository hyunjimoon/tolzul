# ðŸŸ§G12 - Linear Quality Model

**Proposition 1: Optimal Quality Under Linear Commitment Probabilities**

Given linear commitment functions $P_c(q) = q$ and $P_r(q) = 1-q$ for $q \in [0,1]$, the optimal quality is: $q^* = \frac{V + 2C_o}{2(C_u + C_o + V)}$ with comparative static: $\frac{\partial q^*}{\partial V} = \frac{C_u - C_o}{2(C_u + C_o + V)^2}$

The foundational linear quality model establishes tractable mathematical relationships where customer commitment follows $P_c(q) = q$ and resource partner commitment follows $P_r(q) = 1-q$, creating a symmetric trade-off structure that enables closed-form optimization solutions. The expected loss function $L(q) = C_o(1-q)Â² + C_uqÂ² - Vq(1-q)$ captures three distinct economic components: overage costs from resource partner non-commitment, underage costs from customer non-commitment, and value destruction from stakeholder misalignment that occurs when quality fails to achieve simultaneous commitments. First-order optimization yields the analytical solution $q^* = (V + 2C_o)/(2(V + C_o + C_u))$, demonstrating how optimal quality depends on the cost structure through a modified critical ratio that incorporates the match bonus $V$ alongside traditional underage and overage penalties. This formulation reveals that quality choice fundamentally differs from quantity choice in classical newsvendor logic because the decision variable (quality) directly influences both stakeholder commitment probabilities rather than simply balancing supply against exogenous demand uncertainty. The mathematical elegance of this closed-form solution enables entrepreneurs to compute optimal quality decisions rapidly while maintaining theoretical rigor, addressing [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ§_anderson13_model(startup, integration-decisions)]] emphasis on tractable optimization approaches for resource-constrained entrepreneurial environments.

**Business Intuition: Cost-Priority Principle and Dual-Cost Amplification**

The linear model reveals the fundamental "cost-priority principle" where quality adjusts systematically to avoid the more expensive type of stakeholder mismatch, creating strategic implications that extend beyond traditional newsvendor intuition through dual-cost amplification mechanisms. When overage costs exceed underage costs ($C_o > C_u$), optimal quality increases to attract customer demand and reduce expensive surplus inventory, while the reverse pattern ($C_u > C_o$) drives quality lower to ensure reliable resource partner commitment and avoid costly stockouts. The match bonus $V$ introduces a secondary amplification effect where larger matching rewards pull quality toward the direction of the scarcer stakeholderâ€”if customers are harder to secure than partners ($C_u > C_o$), then increasing $V$ raises optimal quality to capture high-value customer commitments even at the risk of partner defection. Conversely, when partners are scarcer ($C_o > C_u$), the match bonus still increases quality but primarily to balance the fundamental cost asymmetry rather than chase additional matching opportunities. This dual-cost structure creates decision complexity absent in single-stakeholder optimization: the comparative static $\partial q^*/\partial V = (C_u - C_o)/(2(C_u + C_o + V)Â²)$ demonstrates that the direction of match bonus effects depends entirely on which stakeholder imposes higher mismatch costs, enabling entrepreneurs to calibrate quality strategies based on venture-specific stakeholder economics while maintaining mathematical tractability for rapid decision-making under time pressure.
