**Agree - Anderson & Parker (2013)**: "Integration and Cospecialization of Emerging Complementary Technologies by Startups" 

Abstract: "We examine how startups commercialize emerging complementary technologies when established firms control key complementary assets. Using a formal model, we show that startups can overcome this disadvantage through integration and cospecialization strategies. Our analysis reveals that operational decisions about resource allocation and capability development critically determine startup success in markets with strong complementarities." _Relevance: Demonstrates successful application of operations-based decision rules to entrepreneurial contexts._
