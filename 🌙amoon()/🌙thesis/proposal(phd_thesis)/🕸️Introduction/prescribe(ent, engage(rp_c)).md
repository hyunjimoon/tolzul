### 2.2 Operational Approach: Newsvendor Logic for Engagement Prioritization

Intuition of decision rule "if pr co < pc cu, then choose resource partner", the harder it is to earn commitment and the lower cost it incurs to have one waiting while earning commitment from other side, the higher priority entrepreneur should give.

**Input:** The second stage begins with the acceptance probabilities (pr, pc) determined by the value propositions and the venture's cost structure: underage cost Cu (cost of having customer commitments without resources) and overage cost Co (cost of having resource commitments without customers). The entrepreneur must choose an engagement action Q_action ∈ {Engage_RP, Engage_C}, deciding whether to prioritize securing resource commitments or customer commitments next. This decision must be made before knowing the stochastic outcome of the chosen engagement.

Process: The Newsvendor critical ratio CR = Cu/(Cu + Co) determines the optimal stocking level; in our context, it determines stakeholder prioritization. Engaging Resource Partners (aiming for D = -1) is optimal when the probability pr ≤ CR, which algebraically translates to pr·Co < pc·Cu. This compares the expected overage cost of prioritizing resources (pr·Co) against the expected underage cost of prioritizing customers (pc·Cu). The entrepreneur should minimize whichever expected mismatch cost is lower, leading to a clear operational decision rule based on the product of probabilities and costs.

**Output:** The Newsvendor logic yields the decision rule: prioritize Resource Partner engagement if pr·Co < pc·Cu; otherwise, prioritize Customer engagement. This rule reveals two key strategic insights. First, the 'Probability Effect' shows it can be optimal to engage stakeholders with lower acceptance probability if their associated mismatch costs are sufficiently low—counterintuitively suggesting entrepreneurs might pursue "harder" stakeholders first. Second, in interdependent scenarios where acceptance probabilities evolve based on prior commitments, the 'Interdependence Effect' requires dynamic re-evaluation of the decision rule as the venture state changes. The framework thus transforms complex stakeholder sequencing into a quantifiable decision based on minimizing expected commitment mismatch costs.

Interpretation (why this model makes sense): We apply Newsvendor optimization logic by comparing expected mismatch costs. The Newsvendor model's characteristics—such as its focus on a **single network node**, its core assumption of **stochastic demand**, a **zero lead time** for decisions to take effect within the period, a **single-period horizon** for optimization, its typical application to **one product**, and the general absence of explicit capacity limits in determining the optimal order quantity—collectively make it a remarkably suitable foundation for the STRAP framework's approach to entrepreneurial decision-making. Specifically, the single-node focus mirrors STRAP's application to an individual venture's strategic choices. The stochastic demand assumption directly reflects the uncertain nature of stakeholder acceptance that STRAP models, for instance, through probabilistic outcomes like D=2⋅Bernoulli(pc​)−1. The zero lead time characteristic aligns with STRAP's emphasis on the immediate consequences and outcomes of a specific engagement cycle, while the single-period horizon allows STRAP to frame and optimize distinct, critical phases or strategic thrusts within the longer entrepreneurial journey. Furthermore, the one-product trait corresponds well with STRAP's concentration on the core venture proposition, and the "no capacity limits" aspect translates in STRAP to a focus on optimally balancing the strategic risks of mismatch (represented by Cu​ and Co​) for a given engagement priority, rather than being primarily constrained by arbitrary limits on the "amount" of strategic emphasis itself. These congruent traits establish the Newsvendor model as a robust tool for STRAP, enabling the quantification and guidance of critical stakeholder engagement sequencing decisions under uncertainty.
