### **ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ©GD11-20** - Comprehensive Methodology Core

**Role:** Deliver the complete methodological framework alternating between technical method details and setup/results that validate the approach.

**Instructions:**

- Alternating pattern: Method detail (ğŸŸ§) â†’ Setup/result validation (ğŸŸ©) â†’ Method detail (ğŸŸ§) â†’ Setup/result validation (ğŸŸ©)
- G11-G20: Cover Linear Quality Model, Sigmoid Quality Model, and special cases with mathematical rigor
- D11-D20: Provide setup context and preliminary results that demonstrate model validity
- Maintain mathematical precision while ensuring conceptual clarity for broader POMS audience
- Each ğŸŸ§ sentence should advance technical sophistication; each ğŸŸ© sentence should ground it in practical relevance
