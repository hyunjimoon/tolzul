Utility & Cost Strategy Framework
This table directly translates the whiteboard structure, outlining four strategic scenarios based on the manipulation of utility and cost variables. The explanations and examples are drawn from the provided transcript.

| Scenario | Utility (Customer) Uc | Utility (Resource Partner) Ur | Underage Cost Cu | Overage Cost Co | Strategic Goal & Interpretation        |
| :------: | :-------------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------: | :-------------: | -------------------------------------- |
|    1     |       decrease        |           increase            |        x         |        x        | from low pr-low cr to high pr-low cr   |
|    2     |           x           |               x               |     increase     |    decrease     | from low pr-low cr to low pr-high cr   |
|    3     |       increase        |           decrease            |        x         |        x        | from high pr-high cr to high pr-low cr |
|    4     |           x           |               x               |     decrease     |    increase     | from high pr-high cr to low pr-high cr |

| Venture | $C_u$ (Underage) | $C_o$ (Overage) | Critical Ratio $r$ | Actual Approach vs. STRAP Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tesla Roadster | $\sim \$ 5 \mathrm{M}^*$ | $\sim \$ 2.5 \mathrm{M}$ | $\approx 0.60$ | Customer-First vs. <br> Supplier-First (build supply earlier) |
| Better Place | $\sim \$ 50 \mathrm{M}$ | $\sim \$ 850 \mathrm{M}$ | $\approx 0.06$ | Supplier-First Extreme vs. <br> Customer-First (validate demand first) |
| Webvan | $\sim \$ 300 \mathrm{M}$ | >$1000M | $\approx 0.30$ | Both-Extreme (over-scaling) vs. <br> Customer-First (validate demand first) |
Table 1 Estimated mismatch costs and critical ratios for the venture cases. *Teslaâ€™s underage cost includes $3.8M in emergency logistics plus qualitative costs (reputation damage, rework), whereas its overage cost is estimated as the idle capacity cost if they had overbuilt (on the order of a few million).
