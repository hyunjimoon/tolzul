| Venture | $C_u$ (Underage) | $C_o$ (Overage) | Critical Ratio $r$ | Actual Approach vs. STRAP Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tesla Roadster | $\sim \$ 5 \mathrm{M}^*$ | $\sim \$ 2.5 \mathrm{M}$ | $\approx 0.60$ | Customer-First vs. <br> Supplier-First (build supply earlier) |
| Better Place | $\sim \$ 50 \mathrm{M}$ | $\sim \$ 850 \mathrm{M}$ | $\approx 0.06$ | Supplier-First Extreme vs. <br> Customer-First (validate demand first) |
| Webvan | $\sim \$ 300 \mathrm{M}$ | >$1000M | $\approx 0.30$ | Both-Extreme (over-scaling) vs. <br> Customer-First (validate demand first) |
Table 1 Estimated mismatch costs and critical ratios for the venture cases. *Teslaâ€™s underage cost includes $3.8M in emergency logistics plus qualitative costs (reputation damage, rework), whereas its overage cost is estimated as the idle capacity cost if they had overbuilt (on the order of a few million).
