### **ðŸŸªðŸŸªA2122** - Problem Complexity Deepening

**Role:** Deepen the complexity analysis by examining the constraint structure and data generation challenges specific to entrepreneurial innovation.

**Instructions:**

- Sentence A21: Elaborate on the "large number of variables" challenge (no constraints, blank slate, stakeholder interactions)
- Sentence A22: Introduce the "small number of constraints" paradox (time/tool limitations, dual physical/mental model complexity)
- Position these as the specific manifestation of general complexity that requires the sophisticated methodology developed
- Create urgency for the advanced techniques presented in the methods section
