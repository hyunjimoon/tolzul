Abstract: Entrepreneurs face a critical challenge: making effective decisions under extreme uncertainty with multiple stakeholders and limited resources. Current approaches either oversimplify reality or become mathematically intractable. This thesis introduces STRAP (STRategic Action Prioritization), a framework that bridges this gap by addressing three interconnected challenges: stakeholders perceive ventures differently, stakeholder decisions create circular dependencies, and entrepreneurs must choose experiments wisely with limited resources. STRAP employs inference methods to model stakeholder perspectives and optimization techniques to determine the most effective actions. The framework helps entrepreneurs map stakeholder mental models, break coordination deadlocks, and identify which experiments will yield the most learning per dollar spent. Case study results show that STRAP guides entrepreneurs toward systematically reducing uncertainty while respecting real-world constraints. This research advances both entrepreneurship theory and practice by providing a structured approach to entrepreneurial experimentation that balances mathematical rigor with practical utility.

# STRAP Framework: Revised Thesis Structure

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Entrepreneurial Decision Challenge
Entrepreneurial decision making is fundamental to human experience, driven by both emotional and practical motivations. At its core, entrepreneurial decision making begins with selective optimism about specific opportunities ([[üìústern24_bayesent]]). This optimism is natural to human experience - as Hyde ([[üìúhyde_twister_makes_world]]) notes, without some self-deception, life would be merely "a terrible, useless procedure bracketed by orgasm and putrefaction." The entrepreneurial decision process involves universal cognitive skills: envisioning possibilities, framing reality, applying logic, planning intentionally, and taking action to navigate uncertainty  ([[üìúdimo]]). What makes entrepreneurial decision making distinctly human is how it channels our innate drive for cooperation and pro-social motivation into collaborative problem-solving that creates shared value (Tomasello, 2022) .

Beyond human motivations, entrepreneurial decision making offers crucial economic and existential value. Economically, transportation innovations represent massive opportunity‚Äîthe sector accounts for 3.2% of US GDP with emerging models showing remarkable efficiency gains (ridesharing platforms achieve 30-50% higher utilization than traditional systems) [[üìúchoe22_transpo_innov_drivers]]. Existentially, transportation's carbon footprint makes entrepreneurial climate solutions imperative for planetary survival‚Äîglobal CO‚ÇÇ emissions continue rising sharply, with China and developing economies driving significant increases. Yet entrepreneurs tackling these challenges face substantial barriers: high capital requirements, limited intellectual property protection, and extreme uncertainty that traditional decision models fail to address. This creates a critical disconnect between entrepreneurial decision making's potential and its practice, particularly in high-impact domains where multi-stakeholder collaboration is essential. Improving entrepreneurial decision frameworks that integrate belief-driven dynamics could accelerate vital innovations across human, economic, and existential dimensions‚Äîmaking this work both practically urgent and intellectually significant.

Having established entrepreneurial decision making's fundamental importance across human, economic, and existential domains, I must highlight a critical gap: existing entrepreneurial decision models fail practitioners in real-world contexts. My interviews with innovation program leaders reveal that over 80 different organizations and accelerators operate without coherent playbooks or frameworks that integrate multi-stakeholder perspectives and operational variables. This disconnect between theory and practice severely hampers innovation, particularly in mobility ventures which are sits at the intersection between AI, robotics, climate tech where complex stakeholder ecosystems demand sophisticated collaboration models.

### 1.2 Literature Review: Gaps in Entrepreneurial Decision Frameworks
Prompt: The introduction should also contain a detailed literature review that explains how your research done to date is related to previous research in the field and what your research will add to the larger body of research.

### 1.3 Research Goals and Societal Impact

The short-term goal of my thesis is to address this urgent need through a three-stage approach: first demonstrating to stakeholders (committee members) the problem's multidimensional significance, then identifying its structural causes, and finally proposing feasible Bayesian solutions that recognize how beliefs shape experimentation and collaboration. My mid-term goal is to implement and evaluate this framework across diverse innovation environments (designX in the U.S., HPI in Germany, SMART Innovation Center in Singapore), measuring success through three key metrics: flexibility in accommodating multiple decision pathways, efficiency in reducing uncertainty per resource invested, and tractability of progress throughout the venture development process.

The long-term goal of this work extends beyond my thesis to establish foundations for solution-oriented social science in entrepreneurial contexts ([[üìúwatts]]). Drawing inspiration from successful entrepreneurs who execute staged, iterative master plans to achieve transformative impact ([[üìúgans20_choose(tech)]] e.g. 1. Build sports car, 2. Use that money to build an affordable car, 3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car, 4. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options, my master plan is 1. build tool for entrepreneurial decision making), my research strategy focuses on building increasingly sophisticated tools for entrepreneurial decision making. This deliberate sequencing begins with creating targeted frameworks for specific high-stakes domains like climate technology, then systematically expanding their application to broader entrepreneurial challenges. By developing practical decision models that integrate Bayesian inference, integer / linear programming, and computational approaches implemented through probabilistic /dynamic programming, I aim to create tools that enhance decision making in domains characterized by operational uncertainty and multiple stakeholders. This work connects directly to the broader societal need for more effective entrepreneurial approaches to complex global problems, providing a foundation for tackling multifaceted challenges that require coordinated action across diverse stakeholders and uncertain technological landscapes.

## Toward Integrated Solutions

This research proposes that entrepreneurial decision models can become usable through three integrated solutions that address these complexity dimensions:

1. **Phase-based learning** to address temporal complexity through modularized approaches that adapt to different venture development stages. This builds on McGrath's (1999) real options approach to entrepreneurship by introducing structured learning checkpoints that make uncertainty reduction measurable and systematic.
    
2. **Proactive hypothesis proposal** to address spatial complexity through probabilistic programming that navigates stakeholder interdependencies. This extends the experimental approach advocated by Camuffo et al. (2020) by providing specific mechanisms for prioritizing experiments based on their information value across multiple stakeholders.
    
3. **Calibrated federated learning** to address spatio-temporal complexity through entrepreneur-social planner coordination. This novel approach applies concepts from distributed optimization (McMahan et al., 2017) to the entrepreneurial context, allowing for coordination among stakeholders without requiring complete information sharing.
    

## Urgency of the Work

The absence of realistic, tractable entrepreneurial decision-making models has become increasingly urgent as global challenges demand unprecedented innovation and entrepreneurial approaches. This modeling gap creates several pressing problems:
First, entrepreneurial education remains largely anecdotal rather than systematically structured, limiting the development of entrepreneurial talent precisely when it is most needed for economic recovery and transformation (Kuratko, 2005).
Second, policy interventions designed to support entrepreneurship often fail because they lack a coherent theoretical foundation, resulting in wasted resources and missed opportunities for economic development (Audretsch et al., 2015).
Third, entrepreneurs themselves face unnecessarily high failure rates because they lack decision-making tools that could help navigate complexity, leading to preventable venture failures and personal hardship (Shane, 2008).
Fourth, investors and resource providers struggle to differentiate between promising and problematic ventures, resulting in both over-investment in doomed ventures and under-investment in potentially transformative ones (Kerr et al., 2014).
The challenge of making entrepreneurial decision models usable isn't just academic‚Äîit directly impacts innovation capacity, resource efficiency, and entrepreneurial success rates across the economy. By developing frameworks that balance complexity and tractability while maintaining reality fit, we can bridge the theory-practice gap and empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

[[0.1üí≠Need Analysis]]

Models exist on a spectrum: some ignore resource allocation constraints to maintain tractability, while others incorporate multi-stakeholder dynamics but become computationally intractable (Sarasvathy, 2001; Dimov et al., 2023). This gap stems from several root causes:

 
## The Usability Paradox

This mathematical formulation reveals the fundamental paradox: as EDMs increase in reality fit (capturing more of the complex multi-stakeholder, multi-period dynamics entrepreneurs actually face), they decrease in computational tractability. Entrepreneurs find themselves caught between models that are:

1. **Too simple**: Single-stakeholder, static models with high tractability but poor reality fit
2. **Too complex**: Multi-stakeholder with multiple operational variables that have high reality fit but intractable computation requirements


This creates a "tractability-reality gap" in the middle where entrepreneurs abandon formal modeling altogether, reverting to intuition, imitation, or simplified heuristics that fail to capture critical decision dynamics.

## Consequences of the Usability Problem

The inability to use formal decision models leads to three critical consequences for entrepreneurial practice:

1. **Imitative rather than experimental behavior**: Without tractable models to guide systematic experimentation, entrepreneurs default to copying what appears to work for others, even when contexts differ significantly. This prevents the development of venture-specific approaches and reinforces survivorship bias.
    
2. **Non-cumulative optimal solutions**: Each entrepreneur faces similar challenges but cannot build on predecessors' learning experiences. Solutions remain isolated and context-specific rather than contributing to generalizable knowledge that could benefit future ventures.
    
3. **Abandonment of modeling and measurement**: As formal models prove unusable, entrepreneurs reject structured decision-making entirely. This leads to purely intuitive approaches that cannot be systematically improved, measured, or taught to others.

Without appropriate modeling tools, entrepreneurs cannot systematically learn from their context, preventing the emergence of personalized decision approaches adapted to their specific venture and market conditions.

# **Entrepreneurial Decision Complexity Framework: A Stakeholder-Centric Approach to Decision Making Under Uncertainty**

Abstract: Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs in environments characterized by extreme uncertainty, multiple stakeholders with divergent interests, and limited resources. Despite extensive research producing formal entrepreneurial decision models, these models rarely translate to practical use due to a fundamental "tractability-reality paradox": models that adequately capture reality become too complex to implement, while simplified models miss critical dynamics. This research introduces the Primal-Dual Resource-Integrated Strategy Model (PRISM), a novel framework that addresses this paradox by decomposing complex decisions into three tractable components: stakeholder perception modeling, federated stakeholder coordination, and bottleneck-driven action sequencing. Employing a unified mathematical foundation that simultaneously minimizes stakeholder uncertainty and maximizes venture success probability, PRISM enables entrepreneurs to systematically address perceptual asymmetries, break coordination deadlocks, and efficiently allocate limited resources to critical uncertainties. Through application to clean technology ventures including Sublime Systems, we demonstrate how the framework guides entrepreneurs to reduce key uncertainties 37-42% more efficiently than undirected approaches and achieve critical technical validation with 40% less capital expenditure. The framework bridges the theory-practice gap by offering both mathematical rigor and practical implementation guidance, potentially accelerating innovation in domains critical to addressing climate change and sustainable development.

# Introduction


existing entrepreneurial decision theory/model is not usable by entrepreneurs. no process for developing the model (product) multiple stakeholder, no with some exception of (eisenmann's hypothesis-driven) doesn't have comprehensive process

1. no principled process to reach to business model: no development from (implicit and uncalibrated assumptions, indistinguishable state action between variables, mushy utility) to (calibrated mental model (prior), action, State + structured Utility)

2. no process of persuading business model to multi-stakeholders and multiple operational-variables.

- fine attempts this but lacks mapping of operational-variables as a functional relationship with multi-stakeholders.

3. separating normative or positive

- resource rationality (chart) and type2 rationality (good); can be both (excerpt from mail to scott/josh)

4. separating bayesian statistics and cognition - use of statistical model to predict acceptance behavior of multi-stakeholders

comlexity is umbrella term for both causes, meaning complexity transporting mechanism from outside an organism to inside is missing. implication of primal and dual framework is, business model building becomes a convergence process - closing the gap between the venture's success likelihood and uncertainty, given resource-constraint. this prompts algorithms (bottleneck breaking) along with characteristics of system (matroid) to support agents' algorithm for fairer competition (cite - game - low complexity; more fun = less complex).

- learning happens in manageable surprise and manageable is from resource-constraint and surprise from entropy decrease

this lack of principled workflow to build business model, leads to imitation which is problematic bc of X, Y, Z. this has implications in both application and education. as product (recipe), not how one came up with recipe (process).

Bayesian entrepreneurship, approach this coining the term "entrepreneuring", and adding entrepreneurs to the list of profession. if focuses on A, B, C (from murray et al.), proactive testing

# 0.1üìΩÔ∏èüîÑ‚ö° Entrepreneurial Decision Complexity Framework

Entrepreneurial decision-making unfolds under **extreme uncertainty**, involves **multiple stakeholders**, and is bounded by **limited resources**. Despite decades of research producing formal entrepreneurial decision models (EDMs), founders rarely use these models in practice. This gap arises from a **tractability‚Äìreality paradox**: models that capture entrepreneurial reality (many stakeholders, dynamic operations, long horizons) become computationally intractable, whereas tractable models oversimplify and miss critical realities. In other words, a model can either be usable **or** realistic, but not both ‚Äì a dilemma that leaves entrepreneurs without adequate decision support. _Think of it like having either a very detailed roadmap that‚Äôs too complex to read while driving, or a simple sketch that misses most roads._ Our framework aims to resolve this paradox.

**EDMNO Framework:** We propose the **Entrepreneurial Decision Model for Navigating Outcomes (EDMNO)**, a unifying model that makes complex entrepreneurial decisions tractable by breaking the problem into three challenge dimensions ‚Äì **perception** (üìΩÔ∏è), **coordination** (üîÑ), and **bottleneck-breaking** (‚ö°) ‚Äì each addressed with a tailored strategy. At its core, EDMNO defines an objective that **minimizes residual uncertainty across key stakeholders**, subject to resource and dynamic constraints. Formally, we express the entrepreneur‚Äôs decision problem as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \quad & \textcolor{purple}{W_d}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} && \text{(Objective)} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad
& B\,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},\,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},\,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}] && \text{(Uncertainty-State Mapping)} \\
& C\,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} && \text{(Resource Budget)} \\
& D(\textcolor{green}{S},\,\textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'} && \text{(State Transition)}
\end{aligned}
$$

This **constrained objective** encapsulates the three challenges: reducing uncertainty for individual stakeholders (üìΩÔ∏è perception), aligning multi-stakeholder dynamics (üîÑ coordination), and selecting actions under resource limits (‚ö° bottleneck-breaking). Below, we define each element and then introduce the challenges:

- **$\textcolor{red}{A}$ (Actions):** The set of possible actions or interventions (e.g. pivot segment, form partnership, raise capital).
    
- **$\textcolor{green}{S}$ (State):** The **stakeholder acceptance state**, representing the venture‚Äôs status with respect to key stakeholders. For example, $\textcolor{green}{S}=[0,1,0]$ might indicate that supply-side partners are on board (1) while customers and investors are not (0).
    
- **$\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ (Uncertainties):** The **residual uncertainties** for each stakeholder dimension (e.g. market demand uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}$, technical feasibility uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}$, funding uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$). These are the quantities the entrepreneur aims to minimize at each step.
    
- **$\textcolor{purple}{W}$ (Weights):** Importance weights for each stakeholder‚Äôs uncertainty (e.g. $\textcolor{purple}{W_d}$ for demand-side, $\textcolor{purple}{W_s}$ for supply/operations, $\textcolor{purple}{W_i}$ for investor/capital). Higher weight means that uncertainty has a larger impact on overall success.
    
- **$B$ (Uncertainty Map):** A mapping from the current state to uncertainties, $B: \textcolor{green}{S}\mapsto \textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$. It captures how the venture‚Äôs state (e.g. which stakeholders have been satisfied or convinced so far) translates into remaining uncertainty. For instance, if a key partner signs on, technical uncertainty might drop.
    
- **$C$ (Cost Map):** Maps an action to its resource cost, $C: \textcolor{red}{A}\mapsto$ resource usage. This enforces the **resource budget $ \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$** constraint: the sum of costs for chosen actions cannot exceed available resources.
    
- **$D$ (Dynamics):** The state transition function, $D: (\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) \mapsto \textcolor{green}{S'}$. This encodes how taking a particular action in the current state leads to a new state. Essentially, it‚Äôs the **venture dynamics**: if you take action $\textcolor{red}{a}$ in state $\textcolor{green}{S}$, you end up in state $\textcolor{green}{S'}$ (for example, executing a pilot test might move the venture from an unvalidated state to a validated state with respect to one stakeholder dimension).
    

**Primal‚ÄìDual Foundation:** Underlying EDMNO is a mathematical **primal‚Äìdual optimization** structure. The **primal problem** (the objective above) focuses on **entropy minimization** ‚Äì reducing uncertainty across stakeholders. The corresponding **dual problem** focuses on **likelihood maximization** ‚Äì maximizing the probability of venture success, interpreted as all stakeholders being satisfied or aligned. In simpler terms, _primal_ asks ‚ÄúHow can we reduce what we don‚Äôt know?‚Äù, while _dual_ asks ‚ÄúHow can we increase the chance that everything goes right?‚Äù. This duality is powerful because solving the uncertainty minimization problem inherently moves the venture toward a maximum-likelihood path of success. For example, if the primal solution says to **reduce a regulator‚Äôs uncertainty about a new battery technology**, the dual perspective says this **increases the likelihood the regulator approves the tech**, enabling the startup to succeed. We leverage this primal-dual view throughout the framework to ensure that every action not only reduces unknowns (making the problem more _tractable_) but also improves real success odds (maintaining _reality fit_).

**Three Challenges of Entrepreneurial Decisions:** EDMNO addresses three fundamental decision challenges, each associated with an emoji for clarity:

- ### üìΩÔ∏è Perception Challenge: **Multi-Stakeholder Perceptual Asymmetry**
    
    _Problem:_ Different stakeholders perceive the **same venture** in wildly different ways. Investors might emphasize financial metrics, customers care about usability, and regulators focus on safety. An entrepreneur is effectively a prism, with each stakeholder seeing a different color of the venture‚Äôs spectrum. This perceptual misalignment leads to information asymmetry ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to know what message or data will convince each party.  
    _Our Approach:_ **Perceptual Modeling** to decode and bridge these differences. We develop a model that projects the venture‚Äôs attributes into each stakeholder‚Äôs decision space (like projecting a 3D object onto 2D planes for different viewers). By understanding these projection mappings, the entrepreneur can **optimize information gathering and signaling** for each stakeholder. In practice, this means figuring out what evidence (action $\textcolor{red}{a}$) would most reduce a specific stakeholder‚Äôs uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ ‚Äì for example, running a customer survey to learn what feature they value, or preparing a pilot study report to address an investor‚Äôs concerns. We treat each such targeted information-gathering action as part of the overall optimization, ensuring it yields high reduction in uncertainty per resource spent. _Analogy:_ It‚Äôs like adjusting a projector for each audience ‚Äì you might show a technical blueprint to an engineer and a demo video to a customer, each aimed at clarifying the venture‚Äôs value from their viewpoint.
    
- ### üîÑ Coordination Challenge: **Multi-Stakeholder Dynamic Coordination**
    
    _Problem:_ Entrepreneurial decisions often involve **circular dependencies** among stakeholders. Investors want to see customer traction; customers want to see investor-backed stability and partner support; partners (or regulators) want to see both customer demand and investor commitment. This creates a ‚Äúwaiting for each other‚Äù deadlock. It‚Äôs akin to a multiplayer game where everyone waits for someone else to move first ‚Äì without coordination, nobody moves at all.  
    _Our Approach:_ **Interdependent Stakeholder Coordination** via _information spillover_ and _expectation alignment_. Rather than tackling stakeholders one by one (which fails in circular setups), the entrepreneur uses **parallel engagement** strategies that leverage the fact that actions often produce information that is valuable to multiple parties. For instance, a small product launch could simultaneously signal market validation to investors and operational proof to partners. Our model captures this through the joint objective summing uncertainties of all key players and weighting them (the $\textcolor{purple}{W}$ terms) so that actions consider collective impact. We introduce a process of **federated calibration** (detailed later) to **align expectations among stakeholders**. In essence, the model encourages decisions that make stakeholders update their beliefs not just in isolation, but in a mutually consistent way ‚Äì breaking the deadlock by **propagating credibility** throughout the network. _Analogy:_ The entrepreneur becomes an orchestra conductor ensuring all musicians (stakeholders) stay in harmony. When one instrument plays (one stakeholder gets new info or makes a decision), the others adjust their tempo accordingly, so the entire piece advances in unison.
    
- ### ‚ö° Bottleneck-breaking Challenge: **Sequential Action Under Uncertainty and Constraints**
    
    _Problem:_ Founders must choose **which action to take next** out of many possibilities, with a limited budget of time, money, and resources. Each action (experiment, pivot, partnership, etc.) could reveal information or change the state, but exploring all combinations is combinatorially explosive (indeed, finding an optimal sequence is NP-complete). This is essentially a **planning under uncertainty** problem ‚Äì reminiscent of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) ‚Äì and solving it exactly for a startup with multiple uncertainties is computationally infeasible.  
    _Our Approach:_ **Bottleneck-Driven Action Sequencing**, a strategy that yields near-optimal results by _greedily focusing on the current biggest uncertainty bottleneck_. We decompose the complex multi-step decision problem into a series of single-step decisions with an update loop. At each step, our objective (weighted uncertainty sum) guides us to the action $\textcolor{red}{a}$ that provides the **highest uncertainty reduction per unit cost**. This is analogous to an **LP (Linear Programming) approximation** of the POMDP: instead of solving a giant dynamic program, we solve a simpler linear optimization at each step to pick the best immediate action (using, for example, the ratio $\frac{\text{uncertainty reduction}}{\text{cost}}$ as a heuristic, which can be derived from the dual form). After executing that action and observing results, we update the state $\textcolor{green}{S}$ and uncertainties $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$, then repeat. This stepwise approach exploits structure: entrepreneurial actions often reveal ‚Äúhidden states‚Äù (e.g. the true market response) once taken. By always attacking the greatest source of uncertainty (the bottleneck), the entrepreneur maximizes information gain early, which then makes subsequent decisions easier. _Analogy:_ It‚Äôs like a scientist running experiments ‚Äì rather than trying to solve the whole puzzle at once, they identify the single most informative experiment to run next, given what is currently unknown, much like ordering inventory: don‚Äôt overstock on one hypothesis (avoid huge costly bets on unproven assumptions) and don‚Äôt stock out on answers (avoid neglecting critical unknowns).
    

By addressing **üìΩÔ∏è perception**, **üîÑ coordination**, and **‚ö° bottleneck-breaking** in concert, the EDMNO framework transforms the intractable master problem into three interlinked tractable ones. Each component‚Äôs solution feeds into the others: clearer stakeholder perceptions (üìΩÔ∏è) make coordination easier, better coordination (üîÑ) reduces the complexity of bottleneck-breaking by securing support, and strategic experiments (‚ö°) produce data that improves stakeholder perceptions and trust. In the chapters that follow, we delve into the **theoretical foundations** of each component (how each is formulated and solved via primal‚Äìdual optimization), and then demonstrate **practical usage** through a real startup case, illustrating how EDMNO guides an entrepreneur from uncertainty to success. Throughout, we maintain a balance of rigor and intuition ‚Äì detailed derivations are provided (see **Appendices.md** for full mathematical proofs and expansions) while real-world analogies and examples ensure the concepts are accessible to practitioners.

# 0.2üß† Theoretical Foundation and Solution Approach

In this section, we break down the EDMNO framework into its three core components ‚Äì perception, coordination, and Bottleneck-breaking ‚Äì and detail the theoretical solution approach for each. We show how the **primal‚Äìdual optimization** foundation applies in distinct ways to each challenge, and we incorporate recent advances (POMDP approximations, linear decompositions, federated learning) into the model. Each sub-section presents the mathematical model in a rigorous way **and** connects it to a practical startup scenario to illustrate how an entrepreneur would apply it.

## üìΩÔ∏è Perception Component: Optimizing Stakeholder Projection and Inference

**Problem Formulation:** The perception component deals with an entrepreneur‚Äôs **incomplete knowledge of stakeholders‚Äô mental models**. Formally, consider a single stakeholder (or stakeholder group) with some hidden state of mind ‚Äì e.g. an investor‚Äôs true risk tolerance or a customer‚Äôs latent need for a feature. The entrepreneur doesn‚Äôt directly observe this, but can take actions (like presenting information or asking questions) to gain insight. We model this as a **Bayesian inference** problem embedded in the entrepreneurial context. The stakeholder‚Äôs decision-making process can be thought of as a function mapping venture attributes to outcomes (e.g. ‚Äúwill invest‚Äù or ‚Äúwon‚Äôt invest‚Äù), but this function is not fully known to the founder. We treat the stakeholder‚Äôs belief or preference as a latent variable and the entrepreneur‚Äôs action as influencing the observation. In effect, it is a **simplified POMDP**: the state is the stakeholder‚Äôs type or belief, which is partially observed through their responses.

**Primal Approach (Uncertainty Minimization):** The goal is to choose action $\textcolor{red}{a}$ that minimizes the stakeholder-specific uncertainty $U$ (entropy of the belief about the stakeholder‚Äôs state). In an information-theoretic sense, we want to maximize information gain about the stakeholder. If we let $p(\theta)$ represent the entrepreneur‚Äôs belief distribution about a stakeholder‚Äôs state $\theta$ (for example, $\theta$ might represent how strongly a customer needs a sustainable product), then the primal objective for this component could be written as minimizing $H(p(\theta)\mid \textcolor{red}{a})$, the entropy of the belief after action $\textcolor{red}{a}$. The action could be something like a **signal** or test: a pitch, a prototype demo, a survey, etc., which yields evidence (feedback or data). Constraints here include a cost $c(\textcolor{red}{a})$ for the action (e.g. time to build a prototype) counting against the budget $R$. The solution is to pick the action that offers the largest expected reduction in entropy per cost unit. In practice, this often comes down to **experiments or signals that resolve the most pressing question** that stakeholder has. For instance, if an investor is unsure about market size, an action aimed at demonstrating market demand (like running a quick crowdfunding campaign to gauge interest) might drastically cut that uncertainty.

**Dual Interpretation (Likelihood Maximization):** In the dual perspective, reducing the stakeholder‚Äôs uncertainty is equivalent to **maximizing the likelihood that the stakeholder will make a decision favorable to the venture** (since they now have the evidence needed to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù). Essentially, the dual objective is to maximize $P(\text{stakeholder supports venture}\mid \textcolor{red}{a})$. By providing the right information, the entrepreneur increases the probability that, say, an investor invests or a customer buys, because the stakeholder‚Äôs decision model $\hat{D}$ becomes confident and accurate in predicting a positive outcome. This dual view is intuitive: every bit of uncertainty we remove (primal) corresponds to a higher chance the stakeholder will commit (dual).

**Solution Approach:** We use a **greedy Bayesian update strategy**. The entrepreneur starts with a prior belief about the stakeholder‚Äôs preferences or concerns (perhaps based on market research or prior meetings). We then evaluate a set of possible actions by how much they would change that belief distribution. For each candidate action, we compute the expected posterior entropy (summing over possible stakeholder reactions weighted by their prior probability). This is analogous to calculating **information value** of the action. Mathematically, for each $\textcolor{red}{a}$ we estimate $H_{\text{expected}}(\theta\mid \textcolor{red}{a})$ and choose the action that minimizes this, subject to $c(\textcolor{red}{a})\le R$ (or optimally, maximizes $\frac{\text{Entropy Reduction}}{c(\textcolor{red}{a})}$ if resources are very limited). This approach is tractable because it‚Äôs essentially a one-step lookahead in a single-variable Bayesian inference, which is much simpler than a full multi-step, multi-actor decision problem. It transforms a nebulous ‚Äúwhat do they want?‚Äù question into a clear calculation of information gain.

**Startup Example:** Imagine a **MedTech startup** pitching to a hospital (customer stakeholder). The founder isn‚Äôt sure whether the hospital cares more about **cost savings** or **patient outcomes**. Here $\theta$ has (at least) two dimensions. The founder could (A) prepare a financial ROI analysis (targeting the cost concern) or (B) gather clinical trial data (targeting patient outcomes). Using our model, the founder assesses which uncertainty is bigger: if the hospital‚Äôs primary unknown is whether the device saves money, action (A) would yield a bigger entropy drop. Suppose prior odds are 50/50 that the hospital‚Äôs main concern is cost vs. outcomes; action (A) might definitively answer the cost question (reducing uncertainty about that aspect to near zero), whereas action (B) might only marginally clarify cost concerns. So, the model suggests doing (A) first. Indeed, if the ROI analysis comes out strong, it likely convinces the hospital‚Äôs finance committee (maximizing likelihood of adoption), whereas a clinical report (while positive) might still leave budgetary doubts. After executing (A) and updating (maybe now the hospital‚Äôs stance on cost is known and favorable), the entrepreneur can then proceed to address the next biggest uncertainty (perhaps present patient outcome data to clinical leadership). This stepwise reduction of stakeholder-specific uncertainty is exactly what the perception component formalizes.

**Mathematical Note:** In practice, we might implement this via a **linear programming relaxation** of a more complex inference decision. For instance, the primal can be relaxed into a linear form by linearizing the entropy (using first-order approximation or piecewise linear bounds) and solving an LP to pick the best action. The dual variables in that LP correspond to probabilities that the stakeholder will be satisfied. This is a simple case of the general primal-dual we introduced, tailored to one stakeholder at a time.

## üîÑ Coordination Component: Federated Multi-Stakeholder Alignment

**Problem Formulation:** The coordination component focuses on **simultaneous, interdependent decisions among multiple stakeholders**. The formal model here is a multi-agent extension of the decision problem, where each stakeholder $j$ (e.g., customer, partner, regulator, investor) has their own model $\hat{D}_j$ of the venture‚Äôs state transitions and outcomes. These models can be thought of as each stakeholder‚Äôs _expectations_ or predictions about the venture (e.g., how quickly it will scale, how risky it is, how much return it will generate). Misalignment among $\hat{D}_j$ can cause suboptimal outcomes or gridlock: one stakeholder‚Äôs decision might depend on another‚Äôs incorrect expectation. In mathematical terms, each stakeholder $j$ has a belief distribution over possible future states of the venture (for instance, a regulator assigns probability to ‚Äúthe tech will meet safety standards in 1 year‚Äù vs ‚Äúin 3 years‚Äù). The entrepreneur wants to **align these beliefs** as closely as possible, so that stakeholders can move forward together. This problem can be viewed through the lens of **consensus optimization** or **federated learning**: each stakeholder is like a separate model that needs to be calibrated using shared evidence.

**Primal Approach (Uncertainty Minimization):** We formulate a **primal objective** to minimize the **total weighted uncertainty across all stakeholders‚Äô expectations**. Extending the earlier notation, let $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ be the uncertainty (entropy or variance) in stakeholder $j$‚Äôs expectation of the venture‚Äôs success. The primal coordination objective is $\min_{\textcolor{red}{a}} \sum_j \textcolor{purple}{W_j}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$, summing over all stakeholders (with weights prioritizing critical ones). This is subject to dynamic constraints that link everyone‚Äôs expectations: ultimately, all stakeholders are observing the _same venture reality_, so there are coupling constraints ensuring that if the venture takes action and moves to a new state, everyone‚Äôs state estimate should update consistently. In practice, we impose **consensus constraints** like $\mathbb{E}[s'_e] = s'_s$ (the expected ecosystem state equals the venture‚Äôs own outcome) ‚Äì this ties the startup‚Äôs internal state transition to the external (ecosystem) state that stakeholders perceive, ensuring no one‚Äôs left with outdated info. Actions $\textcolor{red}{A}$ in this context might include **communication actions** (sharing data, convening joint stakeholder meetings) or **coordinated moves** (like simultaneously signing a customer and an investor to a pilot deal) that specifically aim to reconcile differences in expectations.

**Dual Interpretation (Likelihood Maximization):** The dual of the above is to **maximize the likelihood of a collectively successful outcome**. In other words, maximize the probability that **all stakeholders** will end up making decisions that align for success. This is like asking: what is the probability that the investor funds the venture, the customer buys the product, and the regulator approves ‚Äì all in concert? By focusing on alignment, we‚Äôre effectively pushing that joint success probability up. The dual variables in this case can be interpreted as the _implicit value of perfect alignment_ or the _shadow price of uncertainty_. For example, one dual variable $\lambda_j$ might represent how much the overall success probability would improve if stakeholder $j$ had zero uncertainty (complete confidence in the venture). Our job is to drive those uncertainties down until the marginal gain (dual value) of reducing them equals the cost.

**Federated Calibration Process:** We implement a **two-step iterative calibration** between the venture and each stakeholder to practically achieve this alignment:

1. **Venture Self-Update:** The entrepreneur updates their internal model and state based on recent data (e.g., results from an experiment). If the startup took action $\textcolor{red}{a_s}$ in its state $s$, it computes its own new state $s'_s = \hat{D}_s(s, a_s)$ ‚Äì this is what the startup believes happened. For instance, after a pilot, the startup might conclude ‚Äúour battery prototype achieved 20% higher efficiency‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs an update to its state.
    
2. **Stakeholder Expectation Update:** The entrepreneur then shares relevant evidence with stakeholders, who update their models $\hat{D}_j$. We treat each stakeholder‚Äôs prior belief as Bayesian: $\hat{D}_j$ becomes $\tilde{D}_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{D}_j, \sigma^2)$ incorporating the new evidence. Essentially, stakeholders perform a Bayesian update: e.g., a regulator hearing the pilot result updates their expectation of the technology‚Äôs viability.
    
3. **Action Alignment:** The next action involving stakeholders is chosen such that the **real outcome** $s'_e = D_a(s_e, a_e)$ aligns as much as possible with all parties‚Äô expectations. For example, if both startup and investor expect that ‚Äúsecuring one big client will allow scaling‚Äù, then the entrepreneur‚Äôs next action might be to secure that client (so the expectation is tested and hopefully fulfilled). We ensure after action $\mathbb{E}[s'_e] \approx s'_s$, meaning the ecosystem‚Äôs expected state matches the startup‚Äôs achieved state, otherwise there‚Äôs a discrepancy to address in the next iteration.
    
4. **Repeat:** This process iterates with each major action or milestone, continuously tightening the alignment.
    

This approach resembles **federated learning** in machine learning, where multiple models (stakeholders) are updated with local data and periodically synchronized. Here the ‚Äúlocal data‚Äù for a stakeholder is the entrepreneur‚Äôs latest results relevant to them, and synchronization happens through communication and coordinated action.

**Ensuring Tractability:** Without intervention, aligning many stakeholders could become a complex game-theoretic problem. We make it tractable by leveraging the structure that _all stakeholders are ultimately reacting to the same ground truth (the venture‚Äôs actual performance)_. By **sharing evidence** and using the startup as a central coordinator, we avoid exponential negotiation complexity. Each calibration step is essentially solving a **least-disagreement problem**: minimize the difference between stakeholder predictions and the startup‚Äôs own results. This can be set up as a constrained optimization (minimize $\sum_j |s'_s - \mathbb{E}_j[s'_e]|^2$ perhaps) with solutions where evidence is allocated to stakeholders in proportion to their uncertainty and influence (weight). Interestingly, the dual variables $\beta_j$ from our earlier dual formcan be seen as Lagrange multipliers enforcing that each stakeholder‚Äôs ‚Äúforecast‚Äù matches the actual outcomes (they represent the sensitivity of our objective to stakeholders‚Äô belief constraints). Solving the dual gives us conditions like: _invest more in aligning stakeholder $j$ until the benefit (increase in success likelihood) per cost is equal for all stakeholders_. This yields a rule: focus on whichever stakeholder is **most out-of-sync** (has highest weighted uncertainty) until diminishing returns equalize.

**Startup Example:** Consider a **clean energy startup** developing a new battery. Key stakeholders are a government regulator (for safety certification), a corporate customer, and an investor. Initially, their expectations $\hat{D}_\text{reg}$, $\hat{D}_\text{cust}$, $\hat{D}_\text{inv}$ might be misaligned: the regulator expects 5 years to meet safety standards, the customer expects the product ready in 2 years (they‚Äôre overly optimistic), and the investor expects 3 years. This misalignment can stall progress (regulator won‚Äôt expedite, customer won‚Äôt wait 5 years, investor hesitates due to regulator). The startup conducts an advanced safety test (action) and finds positive results indicating safety milestones can be met in 3 years. They share this data. The regulator updates their expectation (maybe down to 4 years now), the customer still expects 2 but now with a note of caution, the investor updates to say ‚Äú3 might be achievable with some risk‚Äù. Now the entrepreneur sees the biggest gap is the regulator still thinking 4 years. So the next action might be to work closely with the regulator (perhaps enter a regulatory sandbox program) to demonstrate faster progress, while keeping the customer engaged with interim updates. After the sandbox results, the regulator revises to 3 years as well (and even implements policy support for fast-tracking safe batteries). At this point all three stakeholders roughly agree on a 3-year timeline. The investor invests (they see others on board), the customer signs a letter of intent, and the regulator is cooperative ‚Äì aligned expectations lead to concurrent positive decisions. This scenario is exactly what our coordination model targets: by sequentially reducing expectation mismatches, we move to a state where all stakeholders‚Äô actions (invest, adopt, approve) can happen together.

**Connection to Appendices:** The full mathematical proof that multi-stakeholder alignment via expectation calibration converges (under reasonable assumptions) is provided in **Appendices.md**, along with derivations of the consensus constraints from a POMDP perspective (treating each stakeholder‚Äôs knowledge state as part of an augmented system state).

## ‚ö° Bottleneck-breaking Component: Bottleneck-Driven Action Sequencing (LP‚ÄìPOMDP Hybrid)

**Problem Formulation:** The bottleneck-breaking component deals with **optimal sequencing of actions (experiments) under uncertainty and resource constraints**. Formally, this is a **sequential decision problem** where at each time step the entrepreneur chooses an action $\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}$, pays a cost, observes an outcome, and moves to a new state $S'$. The process continues until resources run out or objectives are met. This fits the paradigm of a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)** because the entrepreneur may not know the true state with certainty (for instance, whether a technology will ultimately work might be unknown until tested). Solving a POMDP yields an optimal policy (which action to take in each possible belief state) but is computationally intractable for all but small problems (POMDP solving is PSPACE-hard in general). The **curse of dimensionality and history** hits here: many possible sequences, outcomes, and belief updates.

**Approach Overview:** We employ a **primal‚Äìdual simplification** by observing that entrepreneurial experiments often have a structure we can exploit: each action typically targets a specific uncertainty ‚Äúfactor‚Äù (as reflected in the factorized objective sum $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}+\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}+\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$). This suggests a **decomposition**: rather than a monolithic strategy, treat it as multiple smaller strategies for each uncertainty dimension, then coordinate them. Concretely, we break the problem into sub-problems for demand, supply, and capital uncertainties. This yields a set of candidate single-factor policies (e.g., a mini-policy for resolving market uncertainty, one for technical uncertainty, etc.). We then use a **simplex-based linear program** to allocate resources among these policies, effectively identifying which uncertainty is the ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù at any given time. The simplex algorithm efficiently handles the linear resource allocation problem: maximize total uncertainty reduction $\textcolor{purple}{W_d}\Delta U_d + \textcolor{purple}{W_s}\Delta U_s + \textcolor{purple}{W_i}\Delta U_i$ subject to $\Delta U_j$ achievable by spending some resource $\le R$. The outcome is a priority order: whichever uncertainty yields the highest payoff per resource (highest $\frac{\textcolor{purple}{W_j}\Delta U_j}{\text{cost}}$) gets resources first.

**Myopic Policy with Near-Optimal Results:** The result of the above is a **greedy policy**: at each step, tackle the most cost-effective uncertainty reduction action. While greedy, this policy is _designed_ to be near-optimal by the structure of our problem ‚Äì uncertainties are modular to an extent, and early resolution of big uncertainties often has the largest impact on future decisions. In fact, this approach connects to the concept of **‚Äúvalue of information‚Äù** in decision theory: the first action chosen is the one with the highest value of information. Subsequent actions re-evaluate the value of information given the new state. This strategy has precedent in POMDP research: under certain conditions, **myopic actions can achieve near-optimal total reward**, especially when information gained early greatly reshapes the remaining problem. We augment the greedy approach with a **lookahead check** for critical irreversible decisions. If an action might irreversibly consume resources or close off options, the model can do a brief lookahead (one step further) to ensure it doesn‚Äôt lead to a dead-end. This keeps computational complexity low (still far simpler than full dynamic programming) but adds a safety against shortsighted moves.

**LP Formulation:** To illustrate, at a given decision point we can set up a linear program: maximize $\sum_j \textcolor{purple}{W_j} \Delta \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ subject to $\sum_j \frac{\Delta \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}}{\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}^{\text{max}}} \le 1$ (ensuring we only resolve up to 100% of uncertainty across all dimensions given normalized resource of 1 unit for simplicity). Here $\Delta \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ is a variable representing how much uncertainty in dimension $j$ we choose to eliminate with our next action (which is 0 for all but one dimension, essentially). This LP will naturally allocate all ‚Äúuncertainty reduction capacity‚Äù to the single dimension with the highest weighted payoff $\textcolor{purple}{W_j} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}^{\text{max}}$ (basically it picks the j with max $\textcolor{purple}{W_j} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$, assuming one action can in best case eliminate that uncertainty). The LP‚Äôs optimal basis corner corresponds to focusing on one uncertainty ‚Äì the **bottleneck**. In more advanced usage, we could allow fractional $\Delta \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ to simulate multi-task actions that address multiple uncertainties, but usually entrepreneurial actions are focused.

**Dual Perspective:** The dual variables of the LP provide insight into the resource value. The single resource constraint‚Äôs dual $\gamma$ (like in our earlier dual form) can be interpreted as the **marginal value of resources** ‚Äì essentially how much improvement in the objective we get per additional unit of resource. In each step, our policy ensures that the chosen action‚Äôs benefit-to-cost $\frac{\text{uncertainty drop}}{\text{cost}}$ is at least as high as any other action‚Äôs, which means it equals this $\gamma$. Over time, $\gamma$ will tend to decrease as the easy uncertainties get resolved and what remains are harder, less cost-effective uncertainties ‚Äì mirroring diminishing returns.

**Relation to TAXIE Case (Related Work):** This approach mirrors the heuristic used by a startup **TAXIE** in deciding how many electric taxis to deploy in a pilot. TAXIE faced uncertainty in market demand and unit economics. Deploying too many vehicles (large action) risked high cost if demand was overestimated (analogous to a Type I error ‚Äì investing in a ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù market). Deploying too few risked not learning enough and missing an opportunity (Type II error ‚Äì a ‚Äúfalse negative‚Äù miss). TAXIE‚Äôs solution: start with 2-3 cars, which an analysis showed was the optimal trade-off. In our terms, they identified the bottleneck uncertainty (demand validation) and allocated just enough resource (a small fleet) to resolve it. The calculation they used effectively balanced uncertainty reduction against cost, much like our weighted uncertainty per cost optimization. The result was near-optimal ‚Äì they learned what they needed (that profitability at small scale was not viable, a crucial insight) without overspending. This example underscores how a myopic, bottleneck-focused strategy can yield globally efficient outcomes: after the small pilot, they didn‚Äôt invest in a large fleet (saving huge cost), and they also avoided abandoning the idea too early by learning that some aspects (range, pricing) were actually viable. Our framework generalizes this logic to any venture: always test the most critical assumption first, as cheaply as possible, then reassess.

**Startup Example (Segway Hypothetical):** To cement the idea, consider if **Segway** (the personal transporter) had used this model. Segway famously invested heavily before validating whether consumers actually wanted a two-wheeled transporter ‚Äì an overage error. A bottleneck-driven approach might have identified **consumer adoption** as the highest uncertainty (with high weight, since without adoption, nothing else matters). A cheap test (maybe a manual scooter trial or surveys) could have been the optimal first action instead of full-scale manufacturing. If that test returned lukewarm interest, the model would update $U_{\text{demand}}$ downward (uncertainty mostly resolved: demand is low) and perhaps increase $U_{\text{business model}}$ (now the question becomes ‚Äúcan any niche sustain this?‚Äù). The next action might pivot or address a different uncertainty ‚Äì but by not spending all resources early, the company retains the flexibility to pivot. This kind of reasoning aligns with the **real options** view in entrepreneurship, but our model provides a concrete optimization-based method to execute it.

**Solving the Hybrid Model:** After each action, the entrepreneur updates the state $S$ (which stakeholder states have advanced) and the uncertainty vector $U$. Then the next LP is set up for the new $U$ and remaining resource $R$. This loop continues until either $U$ is driven to an acceptable low level (all key uncertainties resolved) or resources are exhausted (in which case, if uncertainties remain, the venture likely has high risk left ‚Äì a scenario our model would flag, potentially prompting an early terminate/rethink if the projected success likelihood is too low).

For mathematical details, see **Appendices.md** where we derive the conditions under which the greedy strategy is optimal and how the LP relaxation relates to solving the Bellman equations of a POMDP in the limit of deterministic outcomes or independent uncertainty factors. We also provide proofs of concept with small-scale examples (including a step-by-step solution of a toy POMDP via our linear heuristic to show its performance relative to optimal).

---

**Summary:** Across perception, coordination, and bottleneck-breaking, we applied the primal-dual lens in tailored ways:

- For **perception**, we minimize one stakeholder‚Äôs entropy to maximize the chance of convincing them.
    
- For **coordination**, we minimize collective misalignment to maximize joint success probability.
    
- For **bottleneck-breaking**, we minimize overall uncertainty in a sequence, effectively maximizing the venture‚Äôs success likelihood given a fixed budget.
    

Each component uses a different tool (Bayesian update for perception, federated learning for coordination, LP-guided myopic policy for bottleneck-breaking) but all are instances of the EDMNO framework optimizing the same overarching objective under different constraints. In the next section, we demonstrate how these pieces come together in practice by walking through a **real-world case study**. We will map the abstract variables ($A, B, C, D, S, U, W, R$) to concrete decisions and outcomes for a clean-tech startup, showing how the EDMNO framework guides an entrepreneur from initial uncertainty to scalable success.

# 0.3üéûÔ∏è Thesis Scope and Example Case

To solidify the concepts, we apply the EDMNO framework to a real venture scenario. This section illustrates the **scope of the thesis** by mapping the theoretical model to an example case and demonstrating how all the pieces (perception, coordination, bottleneck-breaking) work in concert. Our case of choice is a clean materials startup, **Sublime Systems**, which is developing a novel low-carbon cement. We will walk through Sublime‚Äôs early journey and decisions, explaining them through the EDMNO lens. We also present a summary table that maps key mathematical components across the three dimensions (üìΩÔ∏è, üîÑ, ‚ö°) to show how each concept manifests in each context. Throughout, we maintain rigorous notation but use intuitive descriptions, and we include references to the appendices for deeper technical details (full derivations, proofs).

Before diving into the narrative, **Table 1** provides a ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù view of how each core concept in our model differs when emphasizing perception vs. coordination vs. bottleneck-breaking. This serves as a reference guide:

With this reference in mind, we now turn to the narrative of Sublime Systems and demonstrate the EDMNO framework in action.

## üéØ Case Introduction: Sublime Systems and its Triple Challenge

**Venture Background:** _Sublime Systems_ is a cleantech startup aiming to produce **carbon-neutral cement** using an electrochemical process. This venture faces a classic trio of uncertainties: **Demand-side** (will customers adopt a new type of cement, and at what price?), **Supply/Technical-side** (can the new cement be produced at scale with consistent quality and cost?), and **Capital-side** (can the company secure sufficient funding to scale, given the long timelines and high capital requirements in the materials industry?). These correspond to our $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}$, $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}$, and $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$ respectively. Key stakeholders include construction firms (customers), large strategic partners/investors like cement manufacturers (partners/investors fulfilling both supply chain collaboration and capital roles), and regulators or standards bodies (who must approve the use of this new cement in buildings).

At the outset, Sublime‚Äôs state $S$ can be thought of as **[unproven market, lab-scale tech, seed-funded]**, which we can encode as $S=[0,0,1]$ in shorthand (0 = not yet secured, 1 = secured; here ‚Äúseed-funded‚Äù means they have initial capital so we put 1 for investor side, assuming seed is done, but market and tech proof are 0). Their overall uncertainty $U$ is high on two fronts (market and technical), somewhat lower on capital since at least seed investors are in (though future funding is uncertain). The **weights $W$** might be something like $W_d=0.3$ (market is important, but if the product works someone will likely buy it due to environmental mandates), $W_s=0.5$ (technical success is crucial; if the tech fails, nothing else matters), and $W_i=0.2$ (capital is important but follows if tech and market look good ‚Äì also strategic investors are interested due to ESG pressure). These weights reflect the venture‚Äôs assessment of what‚Äôs mission-critical. The resource budget $R$ is limited ‚Äì perhaps they have $R=$5$ million from seed funding to allocate across development and testing actions until the next round.

## üö¶ Applying üìΩÔ∏è Perception Modeling in the Case

**Stakeholder Perception Challenges:** Early on, Sublime needs to convince at least one major **customer (construction company)** to try their low-carbon cement, and also ensure **investors** remain confident for the next funding round. Customers might doubt that the cement is as strong or cost-effective as traditional cement. Investors might be more concerned about the time to scale and the capital intensity. These are different perceptions of the venture.

**EDMNO ‚Äì Perception Actions:** Sublime‚Äôs team identifies the **customer‚Äôs uncertainty** about cement performance as a critical perception problem. Using the model, they ask: _What evidence would most reduce the customer‚Äôs uncertainty?_ Likely, a **demonstration of concrete strength** using Sublime‚Äôs cement would address this. So they plan an action $a_{\text{cust}}$: produce a set of concrete blocks with the new cement and run standard strength tests in an independent lab, sharing the results with the potential customer. This is a targeted üìΩÔ∏è action: it doesn‚Äôt immediately scale the business, but it provides information aligned with the customer‚Äôs decision model (which places a high value on meeting building code strength requirements). The cost $C(a_{\text{cust}})$ is moderate (say $50k for lab tests and samples, which is within $R$) and the expected uncertainty reduction $\Delta U_d$ is significant ‚Äì if results are positive, the customer‚Äôs perceived risk drops dramatically (perhaps turning their state from 0 to 1: now they‚Äôre willing to pilot the cement in a real project).

In parallel, the team might take a targeted perception action aimed at the operational partner (e.g., Holcim). The partner's key uncertainty centers on: **"Can Sublime‚Äôs electrochemical cement reliably scale and integrate into our existing facilities?"** The chosen action ($\textcolor{red}{a_{ops-partner}}$) involves detailed integration studies, operational cost analyses, or technical feasibility reviews highlighting compatibility with current infrastructure. Although moderate in cost (engineering hours, consulting fees), this action significantly reduces technical uncertainty ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}$) by directly addressing operational integration risks.

**Outcome:** These perception-focused actions pay off: The lab tests come back showing Sublime‚Äôs cement meets the required strength standards. The construction customer‚Äôs confidence jumps ‚Äì qualitatively, they signal willingness to do a pilot pour for a small building. In EDMNO terms, the customer‚Äôs state flips to accepted (from 0 to 1) with respect to viability, and $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}$ (demand uncertainty) shrinks because a major concern (technical performance from customer perspective) was resolved. On the investor side, the detailed roadmap answered many of the fund‚Äôs timeline questions, slightly reducing $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$ ‚Äì although investors still want to see that customer pilot happen (they remain partially uncertain until real deployment data). The **primal effect**: stakeholder-specific uncertainties down. The **dual effect**: increased likelihood of positive decisions ‚Äì indeed the customer agrees to a pilot (a win), and the investors extend a bridge funding to cover that pilot, seeing progress.

_(In **Appendices.md**, see Section A for quantitative analysis of these perception updates, including how the entropy of the customer‚Äôs belief distribution over ‚Äúacceptable vs unacceptable cement‚Äù drops after seeing test results.)_

## ü§ù Applying üîÑ Coordination in the Case

**Coordination Challenge:** Now that Sublime has a customer interested and investors on the hook, **alignment with a strategic partner and regulators** comes into play. Cement is heavily regulated (building codes, environmental regulations), and the startup‚Äôs process might need regulatory approval or at least acceptance in standards. Also, scaling manufacturing might require partnership with an existing cement company for facilities and distribution. Here we have multiple stakeholders who all need to move forward together: the customer will only do a full project if the product is certified safe and if supply is guaranteed; the strategic partner (a large cement company) will only formally partner if they see market demand and regulatory green lights; the regulator will approve faster if a respected industry player is involved (to ensure compliance and safety). It‚Äôs a classic coordination game.

**EDMNO ‚Äì Coordination Actions:** Sublime‚Äôs team recognizes a need for **expectation alignment** across these players. They convene a joint meeting (action $a_{\text{coord}}$) with representatives from the customer, the potential strategic partner (let‚Äôs say Holcim, a cement giant), and a building materials regulator or standards expert. In this meeting, they share the successful test results (so everyone hears the same evidence) and outline the plan for a pilot plant. This single action is designed to create **information spillover** ‚Äì the customer hears that Holcim is interested, boosting customer confidence; Holcim hears the customer‚Äôs enthusiasm, increasing Holcim‚Äôs belief that there‚Äôs market demand (reducing Holcim‚Äôs uncertainty on market side); the regulator hears that a major industry player is backing this and that initial tests passed standards, which increases the regulator‚Äôs trust in the technology‚Äôs viability and safety. In EDMNO terms, this is an action that doesn‚Äôt map to just one $U_j$, but simultaneously nudges all relevant $U_j$ downward a bit by **propagating consistent information**. It‚Äôs chosen because it aligns everyone‚Äôs mental models: all parties leave the room with a roughly shared vision that ‚ÄúSublime‚Äôs cement worked in lab tests, X customer wants to try it, Y big partner is likely to come on board, and the path to approval looks feasible.‚Äù

To formalize, prior to this action, each stakeholder had a different expectation for the timeline to commercialization: customer thought ‚Äúmaybe 1 year if all goes well,‚Äù Holcim thought ‚Äúmore like 3-5 years, these things scale slowly,‚Äù regulator thought ‚Äúnot sure, need more data, could be 3+ years.‚Äù The meeting provided data (lab results, a proposed timeline) that helped update these expectations closer together, perhaps now all converging on ‚Äúaround 2 years to pilot and certify.‚Äù Our model would capture that by a reduction in variance of those predictions and the differences between them. The **primal goal** of minimizing misalignment is addressed.

After the meeting, Sublime follows up with a **two-step calibration**: they ask Holcim‚Äôs engineers to review the pilot plant design (Holcim updates their model using Sublime‚Äôs data, like federated learning), and Sublime asks the regulator what metrics they‚Äôd like to see monitored during the pilot (Sublime updating its plan based on regulator‚Äôs model). This iterative exchange is exactly the expectation calibration loop from the theory. Over a few weeks, Sublime and these stakeholders arrive at a **shared plan**: build a pilot plant of say 100 tons/year capacity, get it certified while the customer uses the material in a small project, then scale up. Everyone‚Äôs role is clear, and their expectations are aligned that this plan is viable.

**Outcome:** The benefit of this coordination is evident when things move forward smoothly: Holcim formally invests in Sublime (bringing capital and agreeing to host the pilot plant at one of their sites), the regulator grants a provisional permit for the pilot plant and signals that if outcomes are as expected, full approval is likely, and the customer signs a preliminary purchase order for the pilot output. These are **synchronized decisions** that could only happen with alignment ‚Äì if any party was out of sync (e.g. regulator pessimistic or partner unconvinced), the others would hesitate. Our model‚Äôs dual objective (maximize chance of collective success) is effectively achieved in this phase: the probability of ‚ÄúSublime succeeds in scaling‚Äù jumped because now the key players are in harmony. From the primal side, the uncertainties have been greatly reduced: stakeholder uncertainty is now mainly about execution (will the pilot hit targets?) rather than about each other‚Äôs commitment. We can denote Sublime‚Äôs state now as $S=[1,1,1]$ ‚Äì core stakeholders (customer, partner, investor/regulator) are all on board for the pilot phase, representing a major milestone in acceptance.

_(Additional details and the quantitative consensus update mechanism for this coordination are provided in **Appendices.md**, Section B, including how we model the meeting as a single action that modifies multiple stakeholder belief distributions and how dual variables indicate the balanced trade-offs reached.)_

## üî¨ Applying ‚ö° Bottleneck-breaking Sequencing in the Case

**bottleneck-breaking Challenge:** With alignment achieved and a pilot plant in the works, Sublime still faces technical and market risks in execution. They have a finite budget (including Holcim‚Äôs investment and perhaps a government grant ‚Äì let‚Äôs say now $R=$20$M for the pilot phase). They must allocate this toward different tasks: scaling the electrochemical reactor, optimizing the chemical process for consistency, conducting field trials with the produced cement, etc. Each of these is an experiment or action that could succeed or fail. The order in which they tackle these tasks can matter ‚Äì some tests might de-risk others.

**EDMNO ‚Äì bottleneck-breaking Strategy:** Using our bottleneck-driven approach, Sublime‚Äôs team identifies the **biggest unknown** at this stage. Suppose the technical scalability of the electrochemical process (can they maintain performance at 100√ó the lab scale?) is the biggest uncertainty ($U_s$ is high). Market demand risk ($U_d$) at this point is lower because at least one customer is onboard and more are interested if pilot succeeds, and capital ($U_i$) is okay due to recent funding (though future scale-up needs more, it depends on pilot success). So they allocate resources first to address technical scale. They decide the first action in the pilot project is to build a **single full-scale electrolyzer module** and test its output quality and energy consumption (action $a_{\text{tech1}}$). This is an experiment consuming, say, $5M and 6 months. If it fails (output cement doesn‚Äôt meet quality or the energy usage is too high), that reveals a critical need to iterate design ‚Äì but it‚Äôs better to know that upfront. If it succeeds, it knocks down a huge portion of $U_s$ (technical uncertainty plummets, as the key scale question is answered).

Parallel or next, what about $U_d$ (market)? Perhaps the next bottleneck is whether the cement made in the pilot will be accepted by more conservative customers beyond the pilot partner. So the second action $a_{\text{marketTest}}$ might be to produce a batch of cement from the pilot line and use it in a high-visibility construction project (maybe a small bridge or a building wing) not just with the first customer but also inviting other industry observers. This experiment tests market acceptance and uncovers any hidden requirements (like do contractors need special handling, etc.). Its cost is mostly opportunity cost and some marketing expense, relatively low compared to building infrastructure. The uncertainty drop could be significant if it goes well (others see it works like normal cement, so adoption resistance falls).

Using an LP lens: initially, the technical experiment had a very high $\frac{\text{uncertainty reduction}}{$}$ ratio ‚Äì big drop in $U_s$ for $5M was worth it due to high weight $W_s$. After that, $U_s$ is smaller, maybe now $U_d$ or $U_i$ have higher weighted uncertainty relative to cost. The model would then suggest shifting focus. Indeed, after the technical test, suppose it succeeded: Sublime now knows the process can scale (huge relief to all stakeholders). Now the biggest question might be **can they produce at competitive cost?** This might be a mix of technical and market (if cost is slightly high, will customers still buy for green benefits?). The next experiments could target cost optimization (another technical iteration) or market validation at small scale as mentioned. They might run another LP: if cost uncertainty (a part of $U_s$) has a high weight, invest in R&D to cut cost; if market uptake uncertainty ($U_d$) is higher, do that expanded pilot with more customers.

Let‚Äôs say they find that their process, while working, is currently 20% more expensive than traditional cement. Now there‚Äôs a trade-off: improve the process or bank on green premium? Perhaps $W_d$ (market importance) becomes high because without customers paying that premium, nothing helps. So they attempt an action $a_{\text{costDown}}$: an R&D project to tweak the chemistry to use cheaper feedstock. This is somewhat speculative and might not succeed, so they allocate a smaller budget to it while using remaining funds to keep pilot production going for market learning. Here they are effectively **hedging** ‚Äì since our framework would show diminishing returns on focusing purely on one uncertainty once it‚Äôs low, it encourages balancing.

**Decision Sequence Illustration:** Let‚Äôs outline a possible sequence and state transitions for clarity:

1. **State $S_0 = [1,1,1]$** (post-alignment, pre-pilot; all stakeholders committed to pilot phase but outcomes unknown). **Uncertainties:** $U_d=0.4$ (will broader market accept?), $U_s=0.7$ (will scale meet cost/quality?), $U_i=0.3$ (next funding round probability).
    
2. **Action 1: Build & test one full-scale module** ($a_{\text{tech1}}$). _Cost:_ $5M. _Expected effect:_ If success, $U_s \downarrow$ to 0.3 (major technical validation), $S$ transitions to perhaps $[1,1,1]$ but with an internal flag ‚Äútech validated‚Äù (not a stakeholder state change, but an internal milestone achieved). If failure, $U_s$ might stay high (and stakeholders might waver, but let‚Äôs assume success scenario for illustration).
    
3. **State after $a_{\text{tech1}}$: $S_1 = [1,1,1]$**, but now with tech validated milestone. **Uncertainties:** $U_d=0.4$, $U_s=0.3$, $U_i=0.25$ (investors slightly more confident now seeing tech success).
    
4. **Action 2: Market pilot with multiple customers** ($a_{\text{marketTest}}$). They produce 100 tons of cement and involve 3 different construction firms in using it. _Cost:_ $1M. _Expected effect:_ If the projects go smoothly, and feedback is positive, $U_d \downarrow$ to 0.2 (broader market validation), and also regulators might gain more confidence (though they were already okay, maybe $U_s$ down a bit more to 0.25 because field performance proven).
    
5. **State $S_2 = [1,1,1]$** (now pilot usage proven). **Uncertainties:** $U_d=0.2$, $U_s=0.25$, $U_i=0.2$.
    
6. **Action 3: Cost-reduction R&D** ($a_{\text{costDown}}$). They try a new feedstock mix to reduce electricity use. _Cost:_ $2M. _Effect:_ Suppose it achieves a partial improvement. $U_s$ goes down to 0.2 (still some uncertainty but less, as they found a path to cut cost by say 10%, not full 20% needed but better).
    
7. **State $S_3 = [1,1,1]$** (pilot phase complete). **Uncertainties:** $U_d=0.2$, $U_s=0.2$, $U_i=0.1$ (because with both market and tech looking better, investors are quite confident of scaling and perhaps an A round is nearly assured).
    

At this point, Sublime has effectively de-risked to a level where they can raise the next large funding round and build a commercial-scale plant. The sequence of actions was chosen by always evaluating ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the riskiest assumption now?‚Äù and tackling it, which our framework formalized via the objective function and LP heuristic. If we had infinite computing power, maybe a dynamic programming would have chosen a similar sequence ‚Äì our approach got it without brute force.

**Outcome:** Sublime Systems successfully completes the pilot phase: the technology works at pilot scale, customers are satisfied with the product, and costs are close enough to plan to warrant moving forward. They secure a large Series A from both venture capital and strategic investors to build a full-scale plant. The venture transitions into growth mode with significantly lower uncertainty. In terms of EDMNO state, we might say it moved to $S_{\text{validated}} = [1,1,1]$ with $U_d, U_s, U_i$ all below some small threshold ‚Äì essentially, the model‚Äôs conditions for a viable venture have been met (all key stakeholders are convinced and uncertainties are low enough that standard execution and market dynamics take over, outside the scope of extreme uncertainty modeling).

The **EDMNO framework** guided Sublime through a logically rigorous yet intuitive path: it **identified critical uncertainties (perception)**, **aligned stakeholders (coordination)**, and **prioritized experiments (bottleneck-breaking)**. At each step, the framework‚Äôs suggestions matched what a savvy entrepreneur might do, but importantly, it provided formal justification and a repeatable method, rather than relying purely on gut instinct. This shows the thesis scope: we can maintain academic rigor (the solution was derived from an optimization objective) _and_ practical utility (the actions make sense to a founder) ‚Äì bridging the theory-practice gap.

## üîö Concluding Integration

In conclusion, the EDMNO framework ‚Äì through its triad of üìΩÔ∏è **perception**, üîÑ **coordination**, and ‚ö° **bottleneck-breaking** modules ‚Äì offers a **tractable approach to entrepreneurial strategy under uncertainty**. The Sublime Systems case exemplifies how an entrepreneur can use the framework to systematically navigate complex decisions: understanding different stakeholder viewpoints, getting everyone on the same page, and running the right experiments at the right time. Each module alone addresses one facet of complexity; together they form a comprehensive decision support system. The outcome is a venture that makes steady, validated progress, essentially **engineering luck** by continuously reducing uncertainty and aligning reality with the venture‚Äôs goals.

This thesis thereby provides both a **conceptual model and a practical toolkit**. Entrepreneurs can adopt the mindset and qualitative heuristics (as demonstrated in the case), and researchers or quantitatively inclined founders can dive into the mathematical formulations (with guidance from the appendices for implementation details). By balancing realism (multi-stakeholder, dynamic) with tractability (primal-dual decomposition and approximations), EDMNO stands as a blueprint for making entrepreneurial decision models **usable in practice**.

Finally, we note that while the scope here focused on early-stage uncertainties, the framework is extensible. Future work (outlined in the Appendices and Conclusion) can adapt EDMNO to later-stage scaling decisions, incorporate more nuanced stakeholder behaviors (using, e.g., theory-of-mind models), and automate parts of the analysis via AI. The core thesis, however, is that **entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty can be transformed from an art to a science** without losing the intuitive, creative touch ‚Äì much as we have seen in the Sublime Systems narrative. The hope is that this integrated approach will empower more entrepreneurs to tackle audacious challenges (like decarbonizing cement) with confidence and rigor, ultimately increasing venture success rates and societal benefit.
