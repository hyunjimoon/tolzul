## 1. Parker & Van Alstyne (2005) Framework & Conclusions

**Framework:**

- Two-sided networks face a "chicken-and-egg" problem: need both sides to participate, but each side waits for the other
- Platform must decide which side to subsidize (even at a loss) to jumpstart the network
- Decision depends on: (1) price elasticity of each side, (2) strength of cross-side network effects, (3) same-side competition

**Key Conclusion:** Subsidize the side that is more price sensitive (elastic) first, especially when that side creates stronger value for the other side. This creates a "catalyst" user base that attracts the other side naturally.

## 2. Variable Comparison Table

|Parker & Van Alstyne|Your Framework|Conceptual Mapping|
|---|---|---|
|**Subsidy decision** (which side to subsidize)|**Engagement sequence** (which stakeholder first)|Both decide irreversible side prioritization|
|**Price elasticity** of each side|**PR, PC** (commitment probabilities)|Higher elasticity ≈ Lower commitment probability (harder to convince)|
|**Cross-side network value**|**Cu, Co** (mismatch costs)|Strong network effects ≈ High mismatch costs|
|**Market thickness** (# of users)|**D** (commitment state)|D=1: thick customer side, thin supplier side<br>D=-1: thick supplier side, thin customer side|
|**Subsidy cost**|**Engagement cost** (implicit in model)|Cost of attracting/convincing each side|
|**"Money side" vs "Subsidy side"**|**Resource partners vs Customers**|Money side pays; Subsidy side gets courted|

**Key Parallel:** Their "subsidize the elastic side when it creates high value for the other side" maps to your "prioritize resource partners when PR·Co < PC·Cu"—both say to start with the harder-to-convince side if the mismatch cost of not having them is sufficiently high.
