## Abstract v1
We present STRAP (Strategic Threshold-based Action Prioritization), a decision-theoretic framework for sequencing entrepreneurial actions under uncertainty. STRAP models a venture as a state transition system with stakeholder acceptance probabilities as state variables. By evaluating each action’s impact on stakeholder “buy-in,” STRAP identifies bottlenecks and recommends a sequence that maximizes the venture’s overall probability of success under resource constraints. Using case studies (Tesla’s Roadster, Better Place, Webvan), we demonstrate that the order of actions—beyond their individual merits—can significantly influence outcomes. STRAP’s quantitative approach integrates theories of iterative learning, bottleneck management, and sequential optimization to guide entrepreneurs in allocating effort where it yields the highest leverage for venture advancement.
## Abstract v2
This paper examines how entrepreneurs should sequence stakeholder engagement when both customer demand and supplier capability are uncertain. Early-stage ventures face a fundamental choice: secure customers before building capacity (risking underage costs when unable to deliver) or build capacity before securing customers (risking overage costs from unused resources). Analysis of venture failures reveals that entrepreneurs systematically choose suboptimal sequences, leading to billions in destroyed capital. We model this as a newsvendor problem where stakeholder acceptance represents inventory states and entrepreneurs must minimize expected mismatch costs. The framework incorporates three levels of complexity: deterministic outcomes where entrepreneurs choose the sequence with lower penalty costs, stochastic independent stakeholders where optimal policy depends on probability-weighted cost ratios, and interdependent stakeholders where conversion of one stakeholder affects the probability of securing others. We derive a critical ratio r = Cu/(Cu + Co) where Cu represents underage costs (penalties from having demand without supply capability) and Co represents overage costs (waste from having supply capability without demand) that partitions the strategy space into customer-first (r < 0.5) and supplier-first (r > 0.5) regions. The model shows that entrepreneurs should prioritize the stakeholder whose absence creates higher expected costs, accounting for both direct penalties and cross-stakeholder effects. This provides a quantitative foundation for entrepreneurial sequencing decisions under uncertainty.

| **2.2 Operations Rules**        | **📐 Contribution 2 Framework**                  | • Building upon defined acceptance states, we apply inventory optimization theory to establish operational decision rules that optimize stakeholder engagement sequences across deterministic, stochastic, and interdependent environments.<br><br>• This structured approach replaces intuitive decision-making with rigorous, probability-informed optimization rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                 | **2.2.1 Deterministic Optimization**             | • Under deterministic conditions (certain acceptance), entrepreneurs directly compare overage (resources without customers) and underage (customers without resources) costs, leading to clear prioritization rules based on mismatch costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                 | **2.2.2 Stochastic Optimization**                | • Introducing acceptance uncertainty, decision rules evolve to compare expected mismatch costs, weighted by stakeholder acceptance probabilities, thus informing decisions that counter intuitive cost-only heuristics.<br><br>• **😲 Probability Paradox Effect:** Entrepreneurs may prioritize stakeholders with higher direct costs if their acceptance probability significantly outweighs alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                 | **2.2.3 Stochastic Interdependent Optimization** | • Incorporating interdependence, where stakeholder acceptance probabilities mutually influence one another, we adjust decision rules to strategically leverage these relationships, minimizing overall mismatch costs.<br><br>• **😲 Interdependence Effect:** Entrepreneurs prioritize repeated engagements with stakeholders whose acceptance strongly enhances the likelihood of successful acceptance by others, even when initial direct costs appear unfavorable.<br><br>• Clearly delineating deterministic, stochastic, and interdependent states is essential to appreciate the deeper operational meaning conveyed in the detailed optimal-decision-rule table. |
