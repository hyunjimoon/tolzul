[[üóÑÔ∏è(methods(üìúü™¢))]]


To reduce complexity and enhance comprehension, we employ a color-coding system throughout our stakeholder engagement framework:
This visual approach allows readers to quickly distinguish between stakeholder types, probability measures, and interdependence relationships within our decision-making model.


STRAP conceptualizes the entrepreneur's sequencing dilemma as a simple two-by-two matrix of stakeholder "states," directly paralleling the newsvendor's classic demand vs. inventory outcomes. Consider a venture that requires **two complementary stakeholders** to create value: a _resource partner_ (broadly representing the supply-side capacity ‚Äì this could be technology development, manufacturing capability, or supplier/investor commitment) and a _customer_ (representing market demand or validation). Each can be either absent (0) or present (1). **Figure 1** illustrates the four possible state combinations and their cost/value implications.

### Key Definitions

Before proceeding with the model development, we establish the core notation using consistent variable types:

**State Notation**: Let $(s_r, s_c)$ denote the venture state where $s_r \in {0,1}$ represents **resource partner** acceptance and $s_c \in {0,1}$ represents **customer** acceptance.

**Transition Probabilities**:

- $\color{violet}{p_c^{xyzw}}$: probability of transitioning from state $(x,y)$ to state $(z,w)$ when the entrepreneur takes **action focused on the customer side**
- $\color{green}{p_r^{xyzw}}$: probability of transitioning from state $(x,y)$ to state $(z,w)$ when taking **action focused on the resource partner side**

**Cost Structure**:

- $\color{orange}{C_o}$ (overage cost): The cost incurred when the venture has built capacity or secured resources but lacks customers ‚Äì the "built it but no buyers" scenario
- $\color{orange}{C_u}$ (underage cost): The cost incurred when the venture has customer demand but cannot deliver ‚Äì the "sold it but can't deliver" scenario

**Value Creation**: $V(1,1)$ represents the positive net payoff when both stakeholders are secured, enabling full value creation.

## Progressive Model Development

We develop the STRAP framework through three stages of increasing complexity, as illustrated in **Figure 2**. This stepwise approach allows us to isolate the impact of each complicating factor on entrepreneurial decision-making.

### 2.1 Deterministic Independent Stakeholders (Known-Known)

We begin with a deterministic scenario where stakeholder outcomes are known with certainty. In this simplified case, transition probabilities are binary: $\color{violet}{p_c^{0001} = p_c^{0111} = 1}$ and $\color{green}{p_r^{0010} = p_r^{1011} = 1}$, meaning that focused action on either stakeholder guarantees their acceptance.

The venture's objective is to move from the starting state $(0,0)$ to the fully realized state $(1,1)$ while minimizing the costs of passing through intermediate states $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$. Since eventual success is guaranteed, the decision reduces to choosing the sequence that incurs the lower interim cost.

**Decision Rule**: The optimal strategy is to pursue the sequence that minimizes expected cost:

- Choose **resource-first** if $\color{orange}{C_o < C_u}$
- Choose **customer-first** if $\color{orange}{C_u < C_o}$

This can be expressed using the **critical cost ratio**: $$r = \frac{\color{orange}{C_u}}{\color{orange}{C_u} + \color{orange}{C_o}}$$

If $r > 0.5$, underage costs dominate, suggesting a **resource-first strategy**. If $r < 0.5$, overage costs dominate, favoring a **customer-first approach**.

### 2.2 Stochastic Independent Stakeholders (Known-Unknown)

We next introduce uncertainty while maintaining independence between stakeholder outcomes. Transition probabilities become: $\color{violet}{p_c^{0001} = p_c < 1}$ and $\color{green}{p_r^{0010} = p_r < 1}$, where $0 < p_c, p_r < 1$. The probability of remaining in the same state is $\color{violet}{p_c^{0000} = 1-p_c}$ and $\color{green}{p_r^{0000} = 1-p_r}$.

**Expected Cost Analysis**:

For a **resource-first strategy**, the expected cost is: $$E[\text{Cost}_{\text{res-first}}] = (1-\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_o}$$

For a **customer-first strategy**, the expected cost is: $$E[\text{Cost}_{\text{cust-first}}] = \color{violet}{p_c^{0001}} \cdot \color{orange}{C_u}$$

The entrepreneur should choose **resource-first** when $(1-\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_o} < \color{violet}{p_c^{0001}} \cdot \color{orange}{C_u}$, which yields the critical probability threshold: $$p_c^* = \frac{\color{orange}{C_o}}{\color{orange}{C_o} + \color{orange}{C_u}} = 1-r$$

**Decision Rule**: Invest in **resources first** if $\color{violet}{p_c^{0001}} > 1-r$, or equivalently if $\color{violet}{p_c^{0001}} + r > 1$.

This threshold directly parallels the newsvendor critical fractile solution, providing quantitative guidance for the often nebulous startup question: "How confident do we need to be before we scale up?"

### 2.3 Stochastic Interdependent Stakeholders (Chicken-and-Egg)

The most realistic scenario acknowledges that stakeholder outcomes are often interdependent. Success with one stakeholder can significantly improve the probability of securing the other, creating classic chicken-and-egg dynamics common in innovation ecosystems.

**Interdependence Mechanism**: We model positive interdependence by allowing cross-stakeholder effects:

- $\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}} > 0$: Having a **resource partner** increases the probability of **customer** acceptance
- $\color{green}{p_r^{0111}} > 0$: Having a **customer** increases the probability of **resource partner** acceptance

These cross-effects capture spillover benefits where "having one stakeholder makes the other more likely to join."

**Extended Transition Probabilities**: The full notation becomes:

- $\color{violet}{p_c^{0001}}$: **Customer** acceptance probability when starting from $(0,0)$
- $\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}$: **Customer** acceptance probability when starting from $(1,0)$ (spillover effect from **resource partner**)
- $\color{green}{p_r^{0010}}$: **Resource partner** acceptance probability when starting from $(0,0)$
- $\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}$: **Resource partner** acceptance probability when starting from $(0,1)$ (spillover effect from **customer**)

**Expected Payoff Analysis**:

The expected payoff of a **resource-first strategy** becomes: $$E[\text{Payoff}_{\text{res-first}}] = \color{violet}{p_c^{1011}} \cdot V(1,1) - (1-\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_o}$$

The expected payoff of a **customer-first strategy** becomes: $$E[\text{Payoff}_{\text{cust-first}}] = \color{green}{p_r^{0111}} \cdot V(1,1) - (1-\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_u}$$

**Decision Rule**: Choose **resource-first** when: $$\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}} \cdot V(1,1) - (1-\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_o} > \color{green}{p_r^{0111}} \cdot V(1,1) - (1-\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}) \cdot \color{orange}{C_u}$$

This can be rearranged to compare the "adjusted" cost ratios after accounting for spillover effects: $$\frac{\color{orange}{C_u}}{1-\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}} \text{ vs. } \frac{\color{orange}{C_o}}{1-\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}}$$

**Strategic Implications**: Positive interdependence amplifies the advantage of whichever stakeholder has stronger "magnetic pull" on the other. If securing **customers** strongly increases **resource partner** probability (high $\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}$), this tilts the decision toward **customer-first** beyond what the static cost ratio alone would suggest. Conversely, if having **resources** substantially boosts **customer** confidence (high $\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}$), **resource-first** becomes more attractive.

In borderline cases where $\color{orange}{C_u} \approx \color{orange}{C_o}$, the decision hinges on which stakeholder provides greater marginal experimental value by most reducing overall venture uncertainty.

## Framework Synthesis

The STRAP model yields a progressively refined decision framework:

1. **Deterministic case**: Compare error costs directly and avoid the larger one using $\color{orange}{C_o}$ vs. $\color{orange}{C_u}$
2. **Stochastic independent case**: Weight costs by likelihood using critical ratio $r = \frac{\color{orange}{C_u}}{\color{orange}{C_u}+\color{orange}{C_o}}$
3. **Stochastic interdependent case**: Additionally account for cross-stakeholder spillover effects ($\color{violet}{p_c^{1011}}$ and $\color{green}{p_r^{0111}}$) that increase joint success probability

This analytical progression provides entrepreneurs with actionable guidance that scales from simple cost comparisons to complex ecosystem dynamics, while maintaining the intuitive logic of the newsvendor framework throughout. The color-coded notation system clearly distinguishes between customer-focused variables ($\color{violet}{\text{violet}}$), resource partner-focused variables ($\color{green}{\text{green}}$), and cost parameters ($\color{orange}{\text{orange}}$), making the framework accessible for both theoretical analysis and practical application.


## 2. Modeling Stakeholder Prioritization with Newsvendor Value Inventory

**STRAP conceptualizes the entrepreneur‚Äôs dilemma as a 2√ó2 matrix of stakeholder ‚Äústates,‚Äù** directly paralleling the newsvendor‚Äôs demand vs. inventory outcomes. Consider a venture that requires **two complementary stakeholders** to create value: a _resource partner_ (broadly representing the supply-side capacity ‚Äì this could be a technology development, manufacturing capability, or supplier/investor commitment) and a _lead customer_ (representing market demand validation). Each can be either absent (0) or present (1). **Figure¬†1** illustrates the four possible state combinations and their cost/value implications:

![[newsvendor(STRAP).png]]
_Figure 1. STRAP stakeholder state matrix and outcomes, in analogy to the newsvendor problem (Underage vs. Overage costs). In state (1,1) both resource and customer are secured, enabling value creation. State (0,0) is the starting point (no commitments, no immediate cost or value). State (1,0) represents an **overage** scenario ‚Äì the venture has built capacity or secured a supply-side resource without a customer, incurring wasted investment (overage cost $C_o$). State (0,1) represents an **underage** scenario ‚Äì a willing customer or market demand appears when the venture has no product or capacity to deliver, incurring a lost opportunity or penalty (underage cost $C_u$)._

In this stylized model, the venture‚Äôs objective is to move from the start (0,0) to the fully realized (1,1) state while **minimizing the costs of passing through the ‚Äúone-sided‚Äù states (1,0) or (0,1)**. Achieving (1,1) ‚Äì a successfully matched supply and demand ‚Äì yields a positive net value $V(1,1)$ (e.g. profit or strategic value from delivering the innovation to a customer). However, reaching (1,1) typically requires first securing one side or the other, which can put the venture transiently into an overage or underage state. The entrepreneur‚Äôs sequencing choice is essentially **which cost to risk incurring**: build capacity first and risk having no customer (potential cost $C_o$), or obtain a customer first and risk being unable to deliver immediately (cost $C_u$). This maps directly to inventory decisions: order stock in advance and risk leftover inventory, or wait for orders and risk stockouts.

### 2.1 State Variable Modeling
#### 2.1.1 Deterministic Independent Stakeholders

We begin with a deterministic scenario where the presence of each stakeholder is a decision with certain outcome (a ‚Äúknown-known‚Äù environment). The entrepreneur can **choose the sequence** of conversion without uncertainty about eventual outcomes. Suppose converting the resource partner (e.g. building the product or securing a supplier) _will definitely succeed_ and eventually a customer will definitely materialize as well (or vice versa); the only difference sequence makes is whether the venture incurs an interim cost from having one without the other. In this deterministic, single-period setting, the optimal strategy is straightforward: **pursue the sequence that incurs the lesser of the two costs**[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). If the overage cost of having idle capacity is lower (i.e. $C_o < C_u$), the venture should _‚Äúbuild it before they come‚Äù_ ‚Äì secure the resource partner first, then the customer ‚Äì because disappointing an early customer would be more costly than some idle capacity. Conversely, if the cost of missing out on a ready customer is lower ($C_u < C_o$), the venture should _‚Äúget the customer first‚Äù_ and delay resource commitments to avoid sunk costs[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). In effect, the **conversion problem reduces to a simple cost-minimization:** the entrepreneur chooses the path that avoids the higher penalty. This result can be intuited from the state matrix: in a deterministic world the venture _will_ reach (1,1) eventually, so any cost incurred is purely due to the temporary mismatch state. Rationally, one should minimize the damage of that temporary state by choosing the sequence with the smaller cost of mismatch.

To illustrate, imagine a startup developing a hardware product. If having a product ready before finding buyers only costs, say, $100K in carrying cost (e.g. small pilot production that could be repurposed) but failing to deliver to an interested early customer would cost $500K (in lost revenue and reputation), the startup should build the product first. If the situation were reversed (e.g. unsold inventory would cost far more than a lost sale), it should secure customer orders or commitments before scaling up production. **This deterministic logic mirrors the classical newsvendor fill-rate result** ‚Äì if the cost of under-stock (stockout) exceeds the cost of over-stock, stock more (analogous to supply-first), and vice versa[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). In this simplified setting, one can define a **critical cost ratio** $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$: if $r > 0.5$, underage costs dominate (it‚Äôs worse to have a customer and no product), so the venture prioritizes the resource side; if $r < 0.5$, overage waste dominates, so the venture prioritizes the customer side. With deterministic outcomes, this rule is intuitive and _always_ avoids the larger mistake.

#### 2.2 Stochastic Independent Stakeholders

In reality, of course, outcomes are uncertain ‚Äì the venture does not know for sure if or when a customer will emerge, nor if a resource can be secured smoothly. We next model a single-period **stochastic scenario (known-unknown)** where the two stakeholders‚Äô arrivals are independent random events. Let $p_c$ be the probability that at least one viable customer is available (i.e. demand exists) in the timeframe of interest, and $p_r$ the probability that a crucial resource partner (or technology milestone) can be attained by that time. ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù here means the occurrence of one does not directly affect the probability of the other (we relax this in ¬ß2.3). The entrepreneur‚Äôs sequencing decision now influences the **expected cost** rather than a guaranteed cost. We evaluate two extreme strategies:

- **Resource-first strategy:** The venture commits to the resource upfront (ensuring $s_r=1$ immediately), then hopes a customer ($s_c=1$) materializes. If demand does not materialize by the end of the period (which occurs with probability $1 - p_c$), the venture ends up in state (1,0) and incurs overage cost $C_o$. If demand does appear ($p_c$ chance), the venture transitions to (1,1) with no lost sales ‚Äì it can fulfill the demand since capacity is ready. The _expected cost_ of this strategy is $(1 - p_c) \times C_o$ (no underage cost is incurred because any demand that arrives can be met).
    
- **Customer-first strategy:** The venture holds off on building capacity until it sees concrete demand. If a customer appears in the period ($p_c$ probability), initially the state is (0,1) ‚Äì demand with no supply ‚Äì causing underage cost $C_u$ (e.g. the startup must delay delivery or lose the sale). Afterward, presumably the venture would rush to build the resource (moving to 1,1, albeit belatedly). If no customer appears ($1 - p_c$ chance), the state stays at (0,0) with no cost (and nothing gained). The expected cost here is $p_c \times C_u$.
    

For simplicity, assume $p_r \approx 1$ for the chosen first action (i.e. if the entrepreneur decides on resource-first, they can successfully secure it ‚Äì the main uncertainty is on the side they did _not_ secure first). We address $p_r$ shortly, but the key comparison is between the two strategies above. To minimize expected cost, the entrepreneur should choose resource-first if $(1-p_c)C_o < p_c C_u$, and choose customer-first if the opposite holds. Setting $(1-p_c)C_o = p_c C_u$ yields the breakeven probability $p_c^* = \frac{C_o}{C_o + C_u}$. This is analogous to the critical fractile solution in the newsvendor model[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=I%20would%20argue%20that%20the,Not%20only%20were%20the%20warehouses)[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=after%20the%20warehouses%20began%20operating,xv). If the entrepreneur believes the likelihood of demand $p_c$ exceeds this threshold $p_c^*$, then committing to supply is statistically justified (the risk of idle capacity is outweighed by the risk of missing out on likely customers). If $p_c$ is below the threshold, a wait-for-customer approach has the lower expected cost.

It is insightful to express this in terms of the earlier cost ratio $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ (often called the **critical ratio** in inventory theory). Note that $p_c^* = \frac{C_o}{C_o + C_u} = 1 - r$. Thus the rule can be stated as: **invest in the resource first if** $p_c > 1 - r$, **or equivalently if** $p_c + r > 1$. In practice, if the underage penalty is large (high $r$ close to 1), even a moderate chance of demand (say $p_c$ around 0.4 or 0.5) would satisfy $p_c + r > 1$, tipping towards a supply-first action. Conversely, if overage waste is the bigger concern (low $r$), one would need a very high confidence in demand materializing to justify building early. Indeed, in the special case where $p_c= p_r = 0.5$ (maximum uncertainty), the decision reduces purely to the cost ratio: $r > 0.5$ implies supply-first, $r < 0.5$ implies customer-first. The **critical ratio $r = C_u/(C_u+C_o)$ thus serves as a concise guide** for stakeholder prioritization under uncertainty, just as it guides stocking levels in inventory management[d3.harvard.edu](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/webvans-demise-or-when-technology-fails-to-meet-operations/#:~:text=Although%20some%20analysts%20argue%20that,realized%20that%20people%20find%20too). This approach gives quantitative rigor to the often nebulous startup question of _‚ÄúHow sure do we need to be before we scale up?‚Äù_ ‚Äì the answer: sure enough that the probability-weighted downside of waiting exceeds that of acting now.

We now briefly consider the role of $p_r$, the probability of successfully securing the resource side in a timely way. In many ventures, achieving supply-side readiness is itself uncertain (e.g. an R&D breakthrough might succeed or fail, a key supplier may or may not sign on). For a **complete expected value analysis**, we would enumerate all four probabilistic outcomes: success of both sides, neither, or just one side. If the entrepreneur goes resource-first, the chance of ending up in (1,0) is $(1-p_c)\times p_r$ (demand doesn‚Äôt show, but resource succeeded) plus the possibility that the resource effort fails outright (which might be seen as remaining in (0,0) with some wasted effort ‚Äì we can fold any sunk R&D cost into $C_o$ for simplicity). Likewise, customer-first could be expanded to consider probability $p_r$ that once a customer is in hand, the venture can quickly secure the resource (e.g. raise money or partner to deliver). If that second-step resource effort fails, the venture stays stuck in (0,1) and likely dies. The math can be extended, but the core insight is unchanged: the optimal policy equates the **expected marginal cost** of each strategy. In practice, entrepreneurs seldom have precise $p_c$ or $p_r$ values; thus, STRAP‚Äôs recommendation is to focus on **relative cost severity (the $r$ ratio)**. This is both easier to estimate (founders can often approximate potential loss from a blown customer deal vs. wasted investment) and directly linked to action: it tells which mistake would hurt more, and thereby which stakeholder to prioritize in order to avoid that mistake. We will see in Section¬†3 how this critical ratio logic cleanly delineates _‚Äúcustomer-first‚Äù vs. ‚Äúsupplier-first‚Äù zones_ for venture strategy.

#### 2.3 Stochastic **Interdependent** Stakeholders

Thus far, we assumed that securing a customer has no influence on the probability of securing a supplier (or vice versa). In reality, **stakeholder outcomes are often interdependent** ‚Äì success on one side can significantly increase the odds of success on the other. This is a classic _chicken-and-egg_ dynamic in innovation ecosystems[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=The%20bet%20was%20risky%20because,from%20adopting%20any%20one%20standard)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/electric-car-company-better-place-shuts-down-after-burning-through-850m-idUS3895319175/#:~:text=Skeptics%20had%20long%20wondered%20about,focus%20on%20Israel%20and%20Denmark). For instance, a corporate partner might be more willing to manufacture your product _if_ you can show paying customers (reducing their risk), and customers are more likely to adopt _if_ you have a credible production and support plan. When positive interdependence is present, the act of converting one stakeholder can **directly improve the prospects** of attracting the other. We can extend the model by introducing a **correlation or cross-impact parameter** $\rho$ between stakeholder outcomes. One way to capture this is to let the conditional success probability of the second stakeholder increase given the first stakeholder is secured. For example, instead of $p_c$ being fixed, we might have $P(\text{customer success} | \text{resource secured}) = p_c + \Delta$, with $\Delta > 0$ reflecting the boost due to the resource commitment (analogously $P(\text{resource success}| \text{customer secured}) = p_r + \Delta'$). A positive $\rho$ means the joint probability $P(s_c=1 \text{ and } s_r=1)$ is greater than $p_c p_r$ ‚Äì intuitively, the stakeholder outcomes reinforce each other.

The decision logic in this interdependent case still hinges on comparing expected costs, but those expected costs must account for the _dynamic feedback_. The entrepreneur should consider the **marginal value of securing one stakeholder first**, including how it improves the chances of landing the second. Formally, the expected cost of, say, the resource-first strategy becomes: $E[\text{Cost}| \text{res-first}] = P(\text{no customer follows} \mid s_r!=!1)\times C_o$. Under positive interdependence, $P(\text{no customer} | s_r=1)$ will be _lower_ than the base $(1-p_c)$, because having the resource in hand makes customer conversion easier. Denote this conditional probability as $(1 - p_c')$ with $p_c' = p_c + \delta$ (where $\delta$ is some function of $\rho$). Similarly, for the customer-first strategy, the likelihood of ending in (0,1) without securing a resource is reduced if having a customer attracts a partner or investor to build the resource. In effect, **securing either stakeholder first not only carries its direct cost risk, but also reduces the opposite-side risk**. To decide optimally, one can calculate the _net expected payoff_ of each sequence: e.g. the resource-first approach yields the full venture value $V(1,1)$ if it triggers eventual customer success (probability $p_c'$), or fails (cost $C_o$) if the customer never comes (probability $1-p_c'$). The customer-first yields $V(1,1)$ if a resource partner subsequently joins (probability $p_r'$) and costs $C_u$ if no resource materializes in time ($1-p_r'$). Setting up these equations, the condition for resource-first being better becomes:  
$$pc‚Ä≤‚ãÖV(1,1)‚àí(1‚àípc‚Ä≤)Co‚ÄÖ‚Ää>‚ÄÖ‚Ääpr‚Ä≤‚ãÖV(1,1)‚àí(1‚àípr‚Ä≤)Cu.p_c' \cdot V(1,1) - (1-p_c')C_o \;>\; p_r' \cdot V(1,1) - (1-p_r')C_u.pc‚Ä≤‚Äã‚ãÖV(1,1)‚àí(1‚àípc‚Ä≤‚Äã)Co‚Äã>pr‚Ä≤‚Äã‚ãÖV(1,1)‚àí(1‚àípr‚Ä≤‚Äã)Cu‚Äã.$$  
Rearranging, this essentially compares $\frac{C_u}{1-p_r'}$ vs. $\frac{C_o}{1-p_c'}$ (the ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù cost ratios after accounting for how much each first action reduces the failure chance of the second). Although the algebra can become involved, the intuition is clear: **positive correlation amplifies the advantage of whichever side has the higher inherent pull on the other.** If securing a customer strongly increases the likelihood of rallying the supply side (as is often true when a credible marquee customer attracts investors or partners), that tilts the equation in favor of customer-first beyond what the static cost ratio alone would suggest. Conversely, if building the technology or securing a key supplier deal substantially boosts customer confidence or network effects, then supply-first becomes even more attractive. In many cases, interdependence will reinforce the original critical-ratio decision: e.g. in markets where overage cost was high (favoring customer-first) it‚Äôs often also true that having customers is critical to convince resource-side stakeholders, doubling down on the need to get demand first.

There are scenarios, however, where **interdependence can flip a decision at the margin**. Imagine a situation where $C_u$ and $C_o$ are roughly equal (say moderate costs either way, so $r \approx 0.5$), but one stakeholder type is significantly more ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù for the other. Perhaps customers inherently won‚Äôt sign without a working prototype, but once you have a prototype the customers flood in (high $\rho$ favoring supply-first). Or vice versa: maybe suppliers are plentiful but will only bother if you have confirmed market interest (favoring customer-first). In such borderline cases, the _marginal value_ analysis says to prioritize the stakeholder that yields a larger increase in joint success probability. In other words, ask: _which side, if secured first, does more to de-risk the overall venture by inducing the other side?_ That side should be tackled first. This aligns with the logic of **marginal experimentation value** in Bayesian entrepreneurship ‚Äì allocate resources to the action that most reduces uncertainty about viabilityfile-jhuw1fjhhdzsopfgfods3cfile-689zeqgkzwbfagddcapwxx. STRAP formalizes this by incorporating cross-stakeholder effects into the expected value calculations, ensuring the guidance remains valid even when stakeholders are connected in a network of influence.

In summary, the STRAP model yields a **progressively refined decision rule**. In the simplest case, compare the two error costs and avoid the bigger one. Under uncertainty, weigh the costs by their likelihood via the critical ratio $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u+C_o}$ ‚Äì a high $r$ (above 0.5) dictates a _supplier-first_ strategy to avoid steep underage penalties, while a low $r$ favors a _customer-first_ approach to avoid large overage waste. In complex ecosystems, additionally account for how one stakeholder‚Äôs early conversion increases the probability of the other‚Äôs arrival; prioritize the stakeholder that provides a greater overall chance of reaching the win-win state (1,1). We next translate these analytical insights into an actionable framework and illustrate them with real venture cases.
