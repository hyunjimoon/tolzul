got [[teja]]'s feedback, took an hour to earn his "ah- ha! this is super interesting". he recommended asking for conceptual illlustration.

### Updated Comparison Table: Heuristic ↔ STRAP (🪢) ↔ Exhaustive Analytics

|**Characteristic**|**Pure Heuristic Commitment**(“Act‑Then‑Adjust”, _effectuation–style_)|**Strategic Reverse Engineering**(🪢 **STRAP** application)|**Exhaustive Optimisation**(“Fully‑Integrated Analytics”)|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Primary question**|_“What first step feels attainable right now?”_|_“Given the focus I’ve already chosen, how do I engineer ecosystem parameters so this path becomes optimal?”_|_“Which single bundle of value‑proposition **and** sequence maximises expected venture utility?”_|
|**Decision sequence**|1. Commit to customer‑ or resource‑first path on intuition.2. Persevere even when parameters mis‑align.|1. Choose focus (customer‑first or resource‑first) based on context/pragmatism.2. Deliberately alter **Cu, Co, pr** until the Newsvendor inequality holds.|1. Enumerate full parameter space {x, Cu, Co, pr}.2. Solve global optimisation for joint value‑proposition & sequence.|
|**Core action**|_Commit‑and‑learn_|_Engineer‑the‑environment_|_Solve a global optimiser_|
|**Role of a model**|None – relies on tacit judgement.|Normative design guide – critical‑ratio inequality gives a clear target region.|Predictive oracle – requires full, high‑fidelity data.|
|**Practical feasibility**|**High** (easy to start) but error‑prone; risk of lock‑in or dead‑ends.|**Moderate** – balances analytical rigour with realistic information requirements.|**Low** – rarely feasible for early‑stage ventures due to data & computational burden.|
|**Illustrative venture**|**Failure:** Better Place locked into supply‑heavy path it could not pivot.**Success:** Many boot‑strapped DTC brands.|**Tesla Roadster launch:** sold units first, then back‑engineered flexible battery supply.**Redwood Materials:** began with scrap‑supply focus, then pivoted to end‑customers once economics aligned.|Hypothetical “digital‑twin” startup that can simulate full market & supply network ex ante.|

_(🪢 sits between an over‑heuristic left extreme and an over‑theoretical right extreme, offering a pragmatic–yet‑analytical middle path.)_
