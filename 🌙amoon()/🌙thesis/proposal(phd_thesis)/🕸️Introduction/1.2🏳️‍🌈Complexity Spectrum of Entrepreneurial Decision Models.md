Just as integer programming becomes NP-complete when discrete constraints meet continuous inequalities, entrepreneurial decision-making exhibits a parallel complexity structure where combining operational and multi-stakeholder constraints creates computational intractability. Part I addresses operational complexity alone through "Bottleneck Breaking," where entrepreneurs facing resource constraints can efficiently prioritize actions using myopic decisions that target the highest uncertainty-reduction-to-cost ratio—analogous to solving linear inequalities in polynomial time. Part II tackles multi-stakeholder complexity alone through "Proactive Testing," where entrepreneurs coordinate multiple interdependent stakeholders by running parallel hypothesis tests that create positive information spillovers—similar to handling integer constraints without inequalities. However, Part III reveals that when both complexities intersect—when entrepreneurs must sequence resource-constrained actions while coordinating multiple stakeholders—the problem becomes intractable, necessitating "Expectation Propagation" as a probabilistic inference strategy. This approach iteratively calibrates beliefs between ventures and institutions through federated learning, enabling the ecosystem to handle the combined complexity that traditional optimization methods cannot address, much like how integer linear programming requires sophisticated techniques beyond those sufficient for its simpler components.

Entrepreneurial decision models span a spectrum of complexity defined by two key dimensions: **operational complexity** (decisions unfolding over time) and **multi-stakeholder complexity** (multiple interacting agents or criteria). At the simplest end of this spectrum are single-stakeholder static strategy models, which consider a one-off strategic choice by a lone decision-maker. These simple models are highly tractable but offer poor reality fit, since they ignore dynamic feedback and the involvement of other stakeholders (e.g., Sarasvathy, 2001; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Increasing the operational complexity yields single-stakeholder dynamic models that incorporate sequences of decisions and learning over time. Such models capture how an entrepreneur adapts through multiple stages (for instance, via staged investment or real options reasoning) while still focusing on one primary actor (Håkansson, 1971; McGrath, 1999).

To better reflect real venture conditions, other models introduce **multi-stakeholder complexity** even in static settings. These multi-stakeholder strategy models consider how an entrepreneur coordinates or negotiates with various actors (investors, customers, competitors) within a single decision context, adding richer criteria to the choice (Gans, Hsu & Stern, 2002; Van den Steen, 2016). This boosts reality fit by acknowledging diverse interests, but tractability remains manageable only because the decision is not sequential. The most comprehensive models embrace both interacting stakeholders and dynamic operations, portraying entrepreneurship as an ongoing process co-created with partners, markets, and investors (Schindehutte & Morris, 2009; Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Roundy, 2018). These high-complexity models achieve a strong fit to entrepreneurial reality (phenomenological richness) but become computationally intractable – indeed, the full **EDMNO** formulation that accounts for all stakeholders over time is NP-complete (as shown in Section 1.1). In essence, the progression from static single-actor to dynamic multi-actor models reveals an engineering-versus-phenomenological trade-off: as we add realism, we lose tractability.

Bridging this tractability–reality gap requires new approaches that retain high reality fit while restoring usability. Rather than abandoning formal modeling, we propose an **engineering** solution that balances these extremes through targeted simplifications and optimization strategies. In this thesis, a three-part framework is introduced to tackle each complexity dimension: **phase-based learning** breaks the decision process into stages to manage operational complexity over time, **proactive hypothesis proposal** uses probabilistic experimentation to navigate multi-stakeholder uncertainty, and **calibrated federated learning** allows entrepreneurs to collectively improve models without sacrificing individual context. Together, these strategies form a mid-complexity decision framework designed to maintain realism (capturing multi-stage, multi-stakeholder dynamics) while remaining computationally tractable. This approach sets the stage for the use cases and solution scope detailed in Section 1.3, aiming to empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

This revised table simplifies the original classification into four clear categories based on two primary axes of complexity: multi-stakeholder interactions and dynamic operational considerations. Each category succinctly captures the trade-offs between tractability and reality fit, highlighting the increasing necessity of novel approaches such as federated learning and proactive hypothesis testing as complexity intensifies, particularly in scenarios involving multiple stakeholders and dynamic operations.

## Progressive Spectrum of Model Complexity

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models becomes evident when examining the progressive spectrum of model complexity:

|Model Type|Temporal Complexity|Spatial Complexity|Tractability|Reality Fit|Need for New Approach|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Strategy-Only, Single Stakeholder**|Low|Low|High|Poor|❌ No|
|**Strategy + Time Steps, Single Stakeholder**|Medium|Low|Medium-High|Moderate|⬇️ Low|
|**Strategy + Multi-Stakeholder (Static)**|Low|Medium|Medium|Moderate|⬆️ Medium|
|**Strategy + Operations + Multi-Stakeholder (Dynamic)**|High|High|Low|High|✅ Yes|
|**Full Operational Scaling + Multi-Stakeholder**|Very High|Very High|Very Low|Very High|🚨 Critical|

As temporal complexity (uncertainty unfolding over time) and spatial complexity (number of interacting stakeholders/variables) increase, the model better represents reality but becomes increasingly intractable. At the highest complexity levels—precisely where real entrepreneurial decisions exist—traditional models become unusable.
- **Temporal Complexity** = How much uncertainty unfolds over time.
- **Spatial Complexity** = How many stakeholders/variables interact.
- **Reality Fit** = How closely the model matches real entrepreneurial conditions.
- **Need for New Approach** for integrated phase-based learning + + calibrated federated learning


## Three-Dimensional Complexity Analysis

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models stems from three interconnected dimensions of complexity:

1. **System Design Issues**: The fundamental tractability-reality tradeoff creates structural barriers to model adoption, as evidenced by the progression from strategy-only to operational-scaling EDMs.
    
2. **Individual Cognitive Barriers**: Entrepreneurs face overwhelming cognitive load attempting to infer both their own preferences and stakeholder responses, leading to ineffective causal reasoning about multi-dimensional decision spaces.
    
3. **Institutional Coordination Gaps**: Misalignment between entrepreneur pace and institutional/societal evolution creates temporal uncertainty that compounds with spatial complexity, particularly when ventures require coordination with broader ecosystem stakeholders.
    

## Toward Integrated Solutions

This thesis proposes that entrepreneurial decision models can become usable through three integrated solutions that address these complexity dimensions:

1. **Phase-based learning** to address temporal complexity through modularized approaches that adapt to different venture development stages
2. **Proactive hypothesis proposal** to address spatial complexity through probabilistic programming that navigates stakeholder interdependencies
3. **Calibrated federated learning** to address spatio-temporal complexity through entrepreneur-social planner coordination

The challenge of making entrepreneurial decision models usable isn't just academic—it directly impacts innovation capacity, resource efficiency, and entrepreneurial success rates across the economy. By developing frameworks that balance complexity and tractability while maintaining reality fit, we can bridge the theory-practice gap and empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

### 🎯 Why this structure works:

- Quickly shows that as we move **right →**, reality fit increases but **tractability collapses**.
- Builds intuitive reason **why smart uncertainty minimization methods** are necessary.
- Shows **where** your methods kick in (middle-high complexity) without overwhelming readers.

The table below compares various entrepreneurial decision models, progressing from a simple single-stakeholder strategy to a highly detailed multi-stakeholder operational model. It shows how **temporal complexity** (time/horizon) and **spatial complexity** (breadth of stakeholders/variables) increase along this spectrum, leading to higher dimensionality, reduced tractability, and changes in phenomenological accuracy. At the extreme end, traditional optimization and heuristic methods become insufficient – underscoring the need for new approaches like **federated learning** (to manage temporal complexity) and **proactive proposal testing** (to manage spatial complexity).
