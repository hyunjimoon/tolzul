## **Core Principle: The "Hamburger Model"**

Every academic paragraph follows the PEER structure - like a hamburger with clear layers that create maximum clarity and flow.

## **PEER Structure (One Point Rule)**

### **P - POINT (Top Bun)**

- **Function**: Topic sentence that states the ONE main point of the paragraph
- **Requirements**:
    - Makes the paragraph's purpose immediately clear
    - Should be understandable without reading the rest
    - Passes the "skip test" - readers can follow paper logic by reading only P sentences
- **Example**: "Stakeholder prioritization is fundamentally complex for entrepreneurs operating in environments characterized by both 'new' and 'fast' dynamics."

### **E - EVIDENCE (Lettuce Layer)**

- **Function**: Concrete examples, data, citations, or empirical support
- **Requirements**:
    - Directly supports the Point with specific evidence
    - Uses authoritative sources appropriate for target journal
    - Provides "ammunition" for the paragraph's claim
- **Example**: "Shane & Venkataraman (2000) demonstrate that entrepreneurs face novel combinations of market conditions, while Eisenhardt & Martin (2000) show that dynamic environments require continuous resource reconfiguration."

### **E - EXPLANATION (Meat & Cheese)**

- **Function**: Analysis, interpretation, and reasoning that connects evidence to point
- **Requirements**:
    - Explains WHY the evidence supports the point
    - Provides causal reasoning or theoretical interpretation
    - Bridges from evidence to broader implications
- **Example**: "This dual complexity manifests because entrepreneurs must simultaneously manage n(n-1)/2 potential stakeholder interactions while operating under severe information constraints, creating exponential prioritization complexity."

### **R - REPEAT/LINK (Bottom Bun)**

- **Function**: Transition sentence that connects to next paragraph or reinforces point
- **Requirements**:
    - Creates smooth flow to next paragraph's topic
    - Reinforces current paragraph's contribution to overall argument
    - Sets up reader expectations for what follows
- **Example**: "Unlike established firms with historical data, entrepreneurs face true uncertainty that requires novel operations management approaches."

## **Quality Control Tests**

### **The Skip Test**

- Read only the P (Point) sentences across paragraphs
- Should create a clear, logical outline of your entire argument
- Reader should understand paper structure without reading full paragraphs

### **One Point Rule**

- Each paragraph makes exactly ONE main point
- If paragraph serves multiple purposes, split into separate paragraphs
- Point should be clear from first sentence alone

### **Flow Test**

- R (Repeat/Link) of paragraph N should connect naturally to P (Point) of paragraph N+1
- No jarring topic jumps between paragraphs
- Logical progression maintains reader momentum

## **POMS Journal Application Guidelines**

### **Literature Integration**

- **E (Evidence)** should prioritize operations management, supply chain, and quantitative business journals
- Cite foundational OR/OM theory in Evidence layer
- Use Explanation layer to connect classical OR to entrepreneurial contexts

### **Mathematical Content**

- **P (Point)**: State what the model/result accomplishes
- **E (Evidence)**: Present equations, proofs, or mathematical derivations
- **E (Explanation)**: Interpret mathematical results for managerial implications
- **R (Repeat/Link)**: Connect to next methodological step or result

### **Empirical Sections**

- **P (Point)**: State the empirical question or hypothesis
- **E (Evidence)**: Present data, results, statistical tests
- **E (Explanation)**: Interpret statistical significance and practical importance
- **R (Repeat/Link)**: Bridge to next analysis or broader implications

## **Common PEER Violations to Avoid**

❌ **Multiple Points**: Trying to make several arguments in one paragraph  
❌ **Missing Evidence**: Making claims without supporting citations or data  
❌ **Weak Explanation**: Presenting evidence without interpreting its significance  
❌ **Abrupt Transitions**: Failing to link paragraphs logically  
❌ **Buried Point**: Hiding main idea in middle or end of paragraph

## **PEER Templates for Different Paragraph Types**

### **Problem Statement Paragraph**

- **P**: "Problem X is complex/challenging because..."
- **E**: Literature showing problem difficulty, failed solutions
- **E**: Why existing approaches are insufficient
- **R**: "This necessitates a new approach that..."

### **Methodology Paragraph**

- **P**: "We address this challenge using approach Y"
- **E**: Technical details, equations, model structure
- **E**: Why this approach is suited to the problem
- **R**: "This framework enables us to..."

### **Results Paragraph**

- **P**: "Our analysis reveals finding Z"
- **E**: Specific results, numbers, statistical significance
- **E**: Practical interpretation and implications
- **R**: "This suggests/enables/leads to..."

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Draft Point sentences first** - Create paragraph outline using only P sentences
2. **Test skip flow** - Ensure P sentences tell complete story
3. **Add Evidence layer** - Support each point with citations/data
4. **Develop Explanation** - Interpret evidence thoroughly
5. **Craft transitions** - Link paragraphs with R sentences
6. **Final skip test** - Verify logical flow remains clear

This PEER system transforms academic writing from unclear rambling into precise, powerful communication that guides readers effortlessly through complex arguments.
