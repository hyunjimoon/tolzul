"A Scientific Approach to Entrepreneurial Decision Making: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial" Abstract: "We investigate whether a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making affects firm performance. We conduct a randomized control trial with 116 Italian startups. We teach the treated startups to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and make decisions based on experimental evidence. Control startups receive training on traditional approaches. We find that startups in the treatment group are more likely to terminate projects, pivot to different ideas, and achieve higher revenue." _Relevance: Shows entrepreneurs struggle with systematic evaluation and benefit from structured decision-making approaches._
