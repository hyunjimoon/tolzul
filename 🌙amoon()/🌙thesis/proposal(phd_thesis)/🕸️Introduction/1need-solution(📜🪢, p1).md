spectrum of too operational and too strategical

with substitutive utility (instead of product market fit) lowers false positive probability, offers flexible strategy and operations (easier to pivot if there's better matching between rp and c), and is more meaningful (reverse engineer given perceptual dimension). compared to product and market fit. 
to construct the meaning of startup strategy and operations, it should be fit around stakeholders, rather than abstract product market fit

| **P5**    | **Nature of the Need: Multi-Dimensional Decision Problem**      | Entrepreneurs face a constrained optimization problem with freedom to choose stakeholder engagement order, resource limitations allowing only sequential engagement, uncertainty in acceptance probabilities, and noisy learning from stakeholder interdependence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **P6**    | **Strategic Need: Operationalizing Bayesian Entrepreneurship**  | While Bayesian entrepreneurship advances heterogeneous belief theory, its focus on "venture success probability" as a random variable creates operationalization barriers for entrepreneurs (who cannot control others' beliefs) and false positive problems for social planners (due to unmeasurable, stochastic, interdependent belief structures).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **P7**    | **Operational Need: Integrated Operations Framework**           | Existing entrepreneurship literature lacks quantitative frameworks that integrate operations management principles with strategic stakeholder engagement under uncertainty and resource constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| P7.5      | explain integrating strategy and operations                     | In our framework, entrepreneurs face a two-stage decision process that bridges strategic and operational dimensions. The first stage encompasses strategic "what and why" decisions‚Äîestablishing value propositions through production specifications, pricing, and quality levels that determine stakeholder acceptance probabilities. The second stage addresses operational "how and when" decisions‚Äîoptimizing stakeholder engagement sequence under resource constraints using newsvendor logic to balance the overage costs of idle capacity against the underage costs of missed opportunities. This integrated approach transforms the abstract challenge of managing heterogeneous beliefs into a concrete state transition system with measurable binary variables, providing entrepreneurs with actionable decision-making tools for navigating the complex path from idea to market validation. |
| **P8**    | **Strategic Solution: Acceptance as Measurable State Variable** | We reframe entrepreneurial validation as a two-stage decision process where entrepreneurs first specify value propositions that directly affect resource partners' and customers' acceptance probabilities, transforming heterogeneous beliefs into operationalizable binary variables through stakeholder commitment verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **P9**    | **Operational Solution: Inventory model (why Newsvendor?)**     | We apply newsvendor logic to the second-stage decision of stakeholder prioritization, where entrepreneurs optimize engagement timing by reacting to forecasted demand of self-fulfillment needs, balancing the 'overage costs' of idle capacity against the 'underage costs' of missed opportunities.<br><br>[[üìúSO_johnston02]]<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**SUBGOAL: given we accept first BE üèõÔ∏èpillar assumption ‚Äúheterogeneous belief‚Äù, I explain two problems of second BE üèõÔ∏èpillar, focusing on its choice of venture success as random variable to analyze the effect of heterogeneity¬†
- problem1: entrepreneurs can‚Äôt operationalize
- problem2: social planners can‚Äôt prevent high false positive problem¬†
- cause: heterogeneous belief on ‚Äúprobability of success‚Äù is unmeasurable, stochastic, interdependent
solution: framing end-of-nail test as finding feasible solution of three dimension decision vector: value proposition, customer, resource partner (i.e. checking whether (v,c,r) exists for ‚Äúmin 0 s.t. A(v,c,r) =b‚Äù).  
[Correctness of solution can be verified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) quickly by asking two questions: ‚Äúresource partner accepted value proposition? [yes/no]‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomer accepted value proposition? [yes/no]‚Äù  
solution is operationalizable to entrepreneurs as 1) value proposition is variable (unlike one and the other‚Äôs belief) and 2) acceptance given this variable is measurable.  
solution can also lower false positives (=(1-p)s2) as commitment from stakeholders increases probability of success (p) and multiple testing decreases sensitivity (s2).**
