# ðŸŸ§G13 - Sigmoid Quality Model

**Proposition 2: Optimal Quality Under Symmetric Sigmoid Commitment Probabilities**

Given symmetric sigmoid commitment functions $P_c(q) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-q}}$ and $P_r(q) = \frac{1}{1+e^{q}}$, the optimal quality is: $q^* = \ln\left(\frac{2C_o + V}{2C_u + V}\right)$ with comparative static: $\frac{\partial q^*}{\partial V} = \frac{2(C_u - C_o)}{(2C_u + V)(2C_o + V)}$

The symmetric sigmoid model extends linear commitment functions to capture realistic S-shaped stakeholder responses through logistic curves: $P_r(q) = e^{-Î²q}/(1 + e^{-Î²q})$ and $P_c(q) = e^{Î²q}/(1 + e^{Î²q})$, where $Î² > 0$ represents symmetric responsiveness intensity that determines the steepness of commitment transitions around the indifference point. The expected loss function $L(q) = C_o P_r(q)[1-P_c(q)] + C_u[1-P_r(q)]P_c(q) - V P_r(q)P_c(q)$ incorporates interaction effects between stakeholder commitments while preserving the fundamental trade-off structure from the linear model, enabling mathematically tractable optimization despite increased behavioral realism. First-order optimization yields the elegant closed-form solution $q^* = (1/Î²)\ln[(V + 2C_o)/(V + 2C_u)]$, demonstrating how optimal quality depends logarithmically on the cost ratio while scaling inversely with responsiveness intensity to maintain equilibrium between competing stakeholder preferences. This logarithmic structure reveals that the sigmoid model preserves Step 1's cost-priority principleâ€”when $C_o > C_u$, optimal quality increases ($q^* > 0$) to avoid expensive overage, while $C_u > C_o$ drives quality lower ($q^* < 0$) to prevent costly shortages. The mathematical elegance of this symmetric formulation enables entrepreneurs to maintain computational tractability while capturing the diminishing marginal effects of quality investments documented by [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ§_petruzzi99_optimize(price, inventory)]] in demand response modeling, providing theoretically grounded yet practically implementable decision support for quality optimization under sigmoid stakeholder response functions.     

**Business Intuition: S-Shaped Responsiveness and Cost-Priority Preservation**

The sigmoid model preserves the fundamental cost-priority principle from linear analysis while introducing behavioral realism through S-shaped commitment curves that reflect empirical patterns in stakeholder decision-making under quality signals. The closed-form solution $q^* = \ln[(2C_o + V)/(2C_u + V)]$ reveals that the match bonus $V$ compresses the cost ratio toward unity, pulling optimal quality toward $q = 0$ (the symmetric point where $P_c = P_r = 0.5$) as matching rewards increase relative to individual mismatch penalties. When stakeholders exhibit symmetric responsiveness ($Î²_c = Î²_r$), the model isolates pure cost considerations: the direction of $Vs impact depends solely on the cost differential through $\text{sgn}(\partial q^*/\partial V) = \text{sgn}(C_u - C_o)$, enabling entrepreneurs to predict match bonus effects based on their venture's specific cost structure. Unlike the linear model's constant marginal effects, sigmoid responsiveness creates diminishing returns to quality investmentsâ€”small quality changes near stakeholder indifference points (around $q = 0$) generate large commitment probability shifts, while extreme quality levels yield minimal additional responsiveness due to saturation effects. This behavioral realism enables entrepreneurs to calibrate quality investments more precisely by accounting for stakeholder psychology: ventures targeting quality-sensitive customers and cost-conscious partners can exploit the steep middle region of sigmoid curves to achieve substantial commitment gains through modest quality improvements, consistent with [[ðŸ“œðŸŸ¦_corbett07_observe(entrepreneurs,newsvendor-behavior)]] empirical findings on intuitive optimization under uncertainty in small business contexts.
