| **M1**   | Step 0       | The classical newsvendor chooses quantity q to meet random demand D, interpretation of optimal quality $q^* = F^{-1}(\frac{C_o}{C_u + C_o})$.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **M2**   | Step 1       | Both supply and demand becomes probabilistic, with endogenized quality q evaluation by customer and resource partner $P(D < q) = q, P(S>q) = 1-q$ <br> $E[Cost]=C_uq^2+C_o(1−q)^2 - Vq(1-q)$ give optimal quality $q^* = F^{-1}(\frac{C_o}{C_u + C_o})$.                                                           |
| **M3**   | Step 2       | This step introduces non-linear stakeholder responses to quality, modeling commitment probabilities with sigmoid functions, $P_c(q)=\dfrac1{1+e^{-\beta_c * q}}$ and $P\_r(q)=\dfrac1{1+e^{\beta_r * q}}$, to capture diminishing returns.                                                                         |
| **M4**   | Step 1 vs. 2 | While both models show the optimal quality's response to the match bonus V depends on the sign of ($C_u−C_o$), Step 1 allows a closed-form solution due to its linear-response assumption, whereas Step 2's non-linear (sigmoid) model requires numerical root-finding, with the exception of beta_c =  beta_r = 1 |
| **M5**   | Step 3 Setup | This step extends the model to a joint optimization of both quality q and production quantity Q, incorporating a diminishing-return revenue function R(Q)=aQ−bQ2 for when both stakeholders commit.                                                                                                                |
| **M6**   | Step 3 Math  | The optimization is separable: the optimal quantity $Q^\* = a/2b$ is found independently of quality, and the optimal quality qdagger is then found by solving the same first-order condition as in Step 2.                                                                                                         |

| **R1** | Step 1      | Quality Strategy    | Quality decisions create **substitutive tensions**: high quality attracts customers but repels resource partners, with three conditions favoring high-quality design.                                                                                             |
| **R2** | Step 1      | Tesla Roadster      | Tesla's Roadster exemplifies this tension—luxury performance attracted customers while forcing partnerships with BBQ grill manufacturers who had to learn battery technology.                                                                                     |
| **R3** | Step 1      | Quality Conditions  | High-quality design is optimal when overage costs are high, underage costs are low, or when reward structures favor risk-avoiding (low V, $\color{green}C_u < \color{green}C_o$) or opportunity-seeking (high V, $\color{green}C_u > \color{green}C_o$) profiles. |
| **R4** | Step 2      | Scale Strategy      | Scale decisions create **complementary benefits**: higher $\color{red}Q$ increases market viability for customers and economies of scale for resource partners.                                                                                                   |
| **R5** | Step 2      | Tesla Evolution     | Tesla's evolution from Roadster (2,450 units) to Model S (936k deliveries) demonstrates moderating divisive quality while scaling unifying quantity.                                                                                                              |
| **R6** | Integration | Strategic Framework | Entrepreneurs can escape zero-sum quality trade-offs by leveraging positive-sum scale benefits to achieve sustainable venture growth.                                                                                                                             |
    **Step 1**: Quality creates substitutive stakeholder tensions  
**Step 2**: Scale creates complementary stakeholder benefits  
**Strategy**: Moderate divisive factors, amplify unifying factors

| **R1** | Step 0 Insight | Classical newsvendor shows optimal inventory increases with profit margin, decreases with holding costs.                                                                         |
| **R2** | Step 0 Tesla   | Tesla would simply choose production quantity—missing all strategic design trade-offs.                                                                                           |
| **R3** | Step 1 Insight | Dual newsvendor reveals the core tension: higher quality attracts customers but repels resource partners.                                                                        |
| **R4** | Step 1 Tesla   | Tesla's fancy Roadster attracted luxury buyers but made it "harder to find factory, battery manufacturer, sports car designer."                                                  |
| **R5** | Step 2 Insight | Joint optimization shows how venture scale $\color{red}Q$ and positioning $\color{red}q$ interact to determine success probabilities.                                            |
| **R6** | Step 2 Tesla   | Tesla's evolution from Roadster (low $\color{red}Q$, high $\color{red}q$) to Model S (higher $\color{red}Q$, moderate $\color{red}q$) exemplifies adaptive parameter adjustment. |
