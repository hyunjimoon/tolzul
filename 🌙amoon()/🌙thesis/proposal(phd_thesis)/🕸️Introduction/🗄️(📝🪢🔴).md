## Abstract
When should early-stage entrepreneurs follow customer-pull versus technology-push strategies? This fundamental question drives 42% of startup failures through quality-commitment mismatches, yet lacks analytical resolution in existing literature.We endogenize this stakeholder prioritization decision by modeling entrepreneurial quality choices through a novel synthesis: like managers choosing order quantities to minimize inventory costs given demand, entrepreneurs choose quality to minimize mismatch costs given stakeholder commitments. This "critical-fractile-of-quality" framework combines discrete-choice modeling with newsvendor optimization. The framework reveals that as quality increases, customer commitment rises (Pc(q)=q) while partner commitment falls (Pr(q)=1-q), creating a critical fractile at q*=(V+2Co)/(2(Cu+Co+V)). This optimal quality then determines stakeholder prioritization—lower quality implies technology-push focus, higher implies customer-pull, but surprisingly, extremes rarely optimize expected value. We extend through sigmoid choice functions that capture behavioral realism: q*sig=ln[(2Co+V)/(2Cu+V)]. Both linear and sigmoid models yield closed-form solutions, making previously intractable strategic decisions analytically solvable. Our contribution transforms stakeholder prioritization from exogenous strategic choice to endogenous quality optimization, providing entrepreneurs with implementable tools for navigating the fundamental tension between market demands and technical capabilities.

## Integration Logic

The module structure follows the **🌱→🌿→🌾** progression:

- **🌱 NAIL Stage (A modules):** Problem crystallization and urgency establishment
- **🌿 SCALE Stage (G/D modules):** Methodological development and validation
- **🌾 SAIL Stage (C modules):** Prescriptive platform and impact optimization

Each module type maintains color consistency while building progressive depth from 5→10→30 sentences, ensuring vertical symmetry in thematic development and horizontal integration across the paper's argument structure.

| **M5** | Step 2 Setup        | The extended model optimizes both quality $\color{red}q$ and scale $\color{red}Q$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **M6** | Step 2 Math         | Joint optimization requires solving $\frac{\partial E[\text{Cost}]}{\partial \color{red}q} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial E[\text{Cost}]}{\partial \color{red}Q} = 0$ simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Para** | **Model**    | **First Sentence**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **M1**   | Step 0       | The classical newsvendor chooses quantity q to meet random demand D, interpretation of optimal quality $q^* = F^{-1}(\frac{C_o}{C_u + C_o})$.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **M2**   | Step 1       | Both supply and demand becomes probabilistic, with endogenized quality q evaluation by customer and resource partner $P(D < q) = q, P(S>q) = 1-q$ <br> $E[Cost]=C_uq^2+C_o(1−q)^2 - Vq(1-q)$ give optimal quality $q^* = F^{-1}(\frac{C_o}{C_u + C_o})$.                                                           |
| **M3**   | Step 2       | This step introduces non-linear stakeholder responses to quality, modeling commitment probabilities with sigmoid functions, $P_c(q)=\dfrac1{1+e^{-\beta_c * q}}$ and $P\_r(q)=\dfrac1{1+e^{\beta_r * q}}$, to capture diminishing returns.                                                                         |
| **M4**   | Step 1 vs. 2 | While both models show the optimal quality's response to the match bonus V depends on the sign of ($C_u−C_o$), Step 1 allows a closed-form solution due to its linear-response assumption, whereas Step 2's non-linear (sigmoid) model requires numerical root-finding, with the exception of beta_c =  beta_r = 1 |
| **M5**   | Step 3 Setup | This step extends the model to a joint optimization of both quality q and production quantity Q, incorporating a diminishing-return revenue function R(Q)=aQ−bQ2 for when both stakeholders commit.                                                                                                                |
| **M6**   | Step 3 Math  | The optimization is separable: the optimal quantity $Q^\* = a/2b$ is found independently of quality, and the optimal quality qdagger is then found by solving the same first-order condition as in Step 2.                                                                                                         |

| **R1** | Step 1      | Quality Strategy    | Quality decisions create **substitutive tensions**: high quality attracts customers but repels resource partners, with three conditions favoring high-quality design.                                                                                             |
| **R2** | Step 1      | Tesla Roadster      | Tesla's Roadster exemplifies this tension—luxury performance attracted customers while forcing partnerships with BBQ grill manufacturers who had to learn battery technology.                                                                                     |
| **R3** | Step 1      | Quality Conditions  | High-quality design is optimal when overage costs are high, underage costs are low, or when reward structures favor risk-avoiding (low V, $\color{green}C_u < \color{green}C_o$) or opportunity-seeking (high V, $\color{green}C_u > \color{green}C_o$) profiles. |

    **Step 1**: Quality creates substitutive stakeholder tensions  
**Step 2**: Scale creates complementary stakeholder benefits  
**Strategy**: Moderate divisive factors, amplify unifying factors

| **R1** | Step 0 Insight | Classical newsvendor shows optimal inventory increases with profit margin, decreases with holding costs.                                                                         |
| **R2** | Step 0 Tesla   | Tesla would simply choose production quantity—missing all strategic design trade-offs.                                                                                           |
| **R3** | Step 1 Insight | Dual newsvendor reveals the core tension: higher quality attracts customers but repels resource partners.                                                                        |
| **R4** | Step 1 Tesla   | Tesla's fancy Roadster attracted luxury buyers but made it "harder to find factory, battery manufacturer, sports car designer."                                                  |
| **R5** | Step 2 Insight | Joint optimization shows how venture scale $\color{red}Q$ and positioning $\color{red}q$ interact to determine success probabilities.                                            |
| **R6** | Step 2 Tesla   | Tesla's evolution from Roadster (low $\color{red}Q$, high $\color{red}q$) to Model S (higher $\color{red}Q$, moderate $\color{red}q$) exemplifies adaptive parameter adjustment. |

| **R4** | Step 2      | Scale Strategy      | Scale decisions create **complementary benefits**: higher $\color{red}Q$ increases market viability for customers and economies of scale for resource partners.                                                                                                   |

can be extended to robust optimization when coefficients have priors and commitment probability becomes distributional. i.e. - `Expected value`: "Based on our market research, we think there's 30% chance the supplier will commit; `Robust`: "We're highly uncertain - the supplier commitment could be anywhere from 20% to 80%, so let's prepare for the worst"
