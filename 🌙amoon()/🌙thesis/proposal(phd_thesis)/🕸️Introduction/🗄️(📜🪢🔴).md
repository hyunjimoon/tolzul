## Abstract 
We present STRAP (Strategic Threshold-based Action Prioritization), a decision-theoretic framework for sequencing entrepreneurial actions under uncertainty. STRAP models a venture as a state transition system with stakeholder acceptance probabilities as state variables. By evaluating each action’s impact on stakeholder “buy-in,” STRAP identifies bottlenecks and recommends a sequence that maximizes the venture’s overall probability of success under resource constraints. Using case studies (Tesla’s Roadster, Better Place, Webvan), we demonstrate that the order of actions—beyond their individual merits—can significantly influence outcomes. STRAP’s quantitative approach integrates theories of iterative learning, bottleneck management, and sequential optimization to guide entrepreneurs in allocating effort where it yields the highest leverage for venture advancement.

| **3. STRAP Decision Framework**          | **🎯 Framework Introduction & Rules Summary** | • After summarizing the decision rules derived from [[2methods(📜🪢, s(p1))]], we use retrospective analysis to illustrate the process of formulating and solving the optimization problem.<br><br>• Intention is to demonstrate: 1) calculation of overage and underage cost, 2) judging the type of situation they are in (how stochastic or interdependent) to make them confident in applying our proposed theory in their decision analysis (for academics) or decision making (practitioners).<br><br>• To refrain from making (incorrect) normative suggestions of past situation where we lack information access, we changed the first name of each company: from webvan, tesla, betterplace, redwood materials to xeban, sesla, cetterplace, redwood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **3.1 Retrospective Cost Analysis**      | **📈 Four Case Studies & Cost Calculations**  | • **Cetterplace (Battery Swap Infrastructure, 2007–2013):** _Actual approach:_ **Supplier-Extreme.** Cetterplace built an extensive network of battery swap stations (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0)) well before securing sufficient EV customers, leading to an (1,0) _failed_ state – the company went bankrupt after burning through ~$850M.<br><br>• **Xeban (Online Groceries, 1996–2001):** _Actual approach:_ **Both-Extreme (Over-ambitious scaling).** Xeban simultaneously attempted to build out supply capacity in multiple cities and stimulate demand, effectively going to (1,0) in a big way (26 massive automated warehouses) and assuming it would quickly get to (1,1*) "hyperscale."<br><br>• **Sesla Roadster (Electric Sports Car, 2006–2008):** _Actual approach:_ **Customer-First (with costly scrambling).** Sesla in its early days focused on proving market demand for EVs, taking deposits from customers and hyping the Roadster (effectively moving to (0,1) – hundreds of customers committed with minimal product ready) while struggling to finalize the supply chain and production.<br><br>• **Redwood (Battery Recycling, 2017–present):** _Actual approach:_ **Resource-First (Technical validation strategy).** Redwood prioritized developing processing technology and logistics capabilities before scaling customer relationships, investing heavily in "machines that can do this in automated ways" and building industrial-scale recycling capabilities (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)), achieving "second largest nickel and lithium supplier" status and processing "70-75% of all US batteries" – validating STRAP's resource-first prescription given high underage costs ($120M vs $50M overage costs). |
| **3.2 Decision Map & Application Guide** | **🗺️ Practical Framework for Confidence**    | • Table summarizes the critical inputs for each case, and Figure visualizes their trajectories and outcomes to demonstrate the **Critical Ratio Decision Framework**, dividing the strategy space into a _Supplier-First Zone (blue, $r>0.5$)_ and a _Customer-First Zone (green, $r<0.5$)_.<br><br>• The visualization illustrates **state transition sequences** and cost outcomes for each case, showing how STRAP analysis would have provided better guidance: Sesla's actual path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) incurred $3.8M underage cost versus STRAP's suggested (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1); Cetterplace's path (0,0 → 1,0 → 0,0 failure) cost $850M versus STRAP's (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) staged approach; Xeban's path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1* → 0,0 collapse) burned $1B versus STRAP's validation-first approach; Redwood's successful path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1) aligns with STRAP's resource-first recommendation, demonstrating optimal stakeholder sequencing in practice.<br><br>• The framework distills decision logic with the key formula $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ as a handy guide: when _underage costs dominate (disappointing customers is costlier)_ – high $r$, supplier-first is optimal; when _overage costs dominate (wasted resources are costlier)_ – low $r$, customer-first is optimal, serving as a quick reference for entrepreneurs to categorize their venture and apply the theory with confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 4.      | Theoretical Contribution                 | • STRAP advances entrepreneurial decision theory by demonstrating that optimal stakeholder sequencing emerges from systematic uncertainty optimization rather than intuitive prioritization heuristics, revealing two counterintuitive effects that challenge conventional entrepreneurship wisdom. |
| 4.1     | Entrepreneurial Operations - Limitations | • STRAP's operational implementation confronts fundamental information asymmetries in cost parameter estimation that create significant barriers to systematic decision-theoretic framework adoption across entrepreneurial contexts.                                                               |
| 4.1     | Entrepreneurial Operations - Solutions   | • The operational barriers identified above necessitate systematic institutional infrastructure development that democratizes access to sophisticated entrepreneurial decision frameworks through standardized information provision and computational support systems.                             |
| 4.2     | Entrepreneurial Strategy - Limitations   | • STRAP's strategic implementation encounters two fundamental challenges that limit systematic stakeholder identification and state variable measurement across diverse entrepreneurial contexts and venture development stages.                                                                    |
| 4.2     | Entrepreneurial Strategy - Solutions     | • Strategic implementation barriers can be systematically addressed through structured stakeholder categorization frameworks and behavioral prediction models that transform ambiguous relationship landscapes into actionable decision variables for optimal sequencing strategies.                |
| 4.3     | Bridging Operations & Strategy           | • The integration of operational efficiency with strategic stakeholder coordination confronts fundamental limitations in belief-state modeling approaches that constrain entrepreneurs' cognitive capacity for complex multi-dimensional optimization under uncertainty and resource constraints.   |
