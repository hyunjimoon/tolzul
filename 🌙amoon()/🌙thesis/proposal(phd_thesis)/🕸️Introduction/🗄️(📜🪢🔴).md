## Abstract
Every entrepreneur faces life-or-death resource allocation decisions under extreme uncertainty. The fundamental question—engage customers or resource partners first—lacks systematic frameworks despite determining venture survival. Better Place's $850M infrastructure-first disaster contrasts sharply with Tesla's customer-validation success, yet no theory explains when each approach succeeds. While Bayesian entrepreneurship advances belief theory, its "venture success probability" focus creates measurement barriers that prevent practical application. We reframe validation as dual acceptance optimization using measurable binary states—"customer accepted? [yes/no]" and "resource partner accepted? [yes/no]." Using Newsvendor logic, resource-partner-first strategies create overage costs (cost to the organization of making product that wouldn't be sold) while customer-first creates underage costs (cost to organization of not being able to deliver the product). Two counterintuitive effects emerge: (1) Probability Effect—even when customers are easier to convince, entrepreneurs should engage resource partners first when underage costs substantially exceed overage costs; (2) Interdependence Effect—when stakeholder acceptances are interdependent, persisting with single stakeholders (resource → resource or customer → customer) may outperform switching (resource → customer or customer → resource). Tesla's customer-first timing and Better Place's resource-first failure align perfectly with our framework's cost-based predictions. We extend inventory theory into strategic management, bridging operations-strategy through stakeholder state modeling. Entrepreneurs gain the first systematic decision rules for stakeholder timing, potentially preventing billions in venture failures while establishing quantitative foundations for entrepreneurship under uncertainty.

| P7.5      | explain integrating strategy and operations                     | In our framework, entrepreneurs face a two-stage decision process that bridges strategic and operational dimensions. The first stage encompasses strategic "what and why" decisions—establishing value propositions through production specifications, pricing, and quality levels that determine stakeholder acceptance probabilities. The second stage addresses operational "how and when" decisions—optimizing stakeholder engagement sequence under resource constraints using newsvendor logic to balance the overage costs of idle capacity against the underage costs of missed opportunities. This integrated approach transforms the abstract challenge of managing heterogeneous beliefs into a concrete state transition system with measurable binary variables, providing entrepreneurs with actionable decision-making tools for navigating the complex path from idea to market validation. |                                             |                      |
| **P8**    | **Strategic Solution: Acceptance as Measurable State Variable** | We reframe entrepreneurial validation as a two-stage decision process where entrepreneurs first specify value propositions that directly affect resource partners' and customers' acceptance probabilities, transforming heterogeneous beliefs into operationalizable binary variables through stakeholder commitment verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                             | Strategic Solution   |

# 2. Methods 

Two stage decision where first value propositions are specified that affects resource partner and customers' acceptance probability. Given this stochastic system with uncertainty in acceptance, second stage decision is which stakeholders to prioritize. This decision is framed as newsvendor model where entrepreneur reacts to forecasted demand of self-fulfillment needs. This has the effect of decomposing decision into two: (1) 💚value proposition attributes (e.g. price, quality) then (2)🔴 task prioritization given resource partner and customer's commitment probability

|**Section**|**Role**|**First Sentences (Bullet Points)**|

|**3. STRAP Decision Framework**|**🎯 Framework Introduction & Rules Summary**|• After summarizing the decision rules derived from [[2methods(📜🪢, s(p1))]], we use retrospective analysis to illustrate the process of formulating and solving the optimization problem.<br><br>• Intention is to demonstrate: 1) calculation of overage and underage cost, 2) judging the type of situation they are in (how stochastic or interdependent) to make them confident in applying our proposed theory in their decision analysis (for academics) or decision making (practitioners).<br><br>• To refrain from making (incorrect) normative suggestions of past situation where we lack information access, we changed the first name of each company: from webvan, tesla, betterplace, redwood materials to xeban, sesla, cetterplace, redwood.|
|**3.1 Retrospective Cost Analysis**|**📈 Four Case Studies & Cost Calculations**|• **Cetterplace (Battery Swap Infrastructure, 2007–2013):** _Actual approach:_ **Supplier-Extreme.** Cetterplace built an extensive network of battery swap stations (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0)) well before securing sufficient EV customers, leading to an (1,0) _failed_ state – the company went bankrupt after burning through ~$850M.<br><br>• **Xeban (Online Groceries, 1996–2001):** _Actual approach:_ **Both-Extreme (Over-ambitious scaling).** Xeban simultaneously attempted to build out supply capacity in multiple cities and stimulate demand, effectively going to (1,0) in a big way (26 massive automated warehouses) and assuming it would quickly get to (1,1*) "hyperscale."<br><br>• **Sesla Roadster (Electric Sports Car, 2006–2008):** _Actual approach:_ **Customer-First (with costly scrambling).** Sesla in its early days focused on proving market demand for EVs, taking deposits from customers and hyping the Roadster (effectively moving to (0,1) – hundreds of customers committed with minimal product ready) while struggling to finalize the supply chain and production.<br><br>• **Redwood (Battery Recycling, 2017–present):** _Actual approach:_ **Resource-First (Technical validation strategy).** Redwood prioritized developing processing technology and logistics capabilities before scaling customer relationships, investing heavily in "machines that can do this in automated ways" and building industrial-scale recycling capabilities (state transition: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)), achieving "second largest nickel and lithium supplier" status and processing "70-75% of all US batteries" – validating STRAP's resource-first prescription given high underage costs ($120M vs $50M overage costs).|
|**3.2 Decision Map & Application Guide**|**🗺️ Practical Framework for Confidence**|• Table summarizes the critical inputs for each case, and Figure visualizes their trajectories and outcomes to demonstrate the **Critical Ratio Decision Framework**, dividing the strategy space into a _Supplier-First Zone (blue, $r>0.5$)_ and a _Customer-First Zone (green, $r<0.5$)_.<br><br>• The visualization illustrates **state transition sequences** and cost outcomes for each case, showing how STRAP analysis would have provided better guidance: Sesla's actual path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) incurred $3.8M underage cost versus STRAP's suggested (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1); Cetterplace's path (0,0 → 1,0 → 0,0 failure) cost $850M versus STRAP's (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) staged approach; Xeban's path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1* → 0,0 collapse) burned $1B versus STRAP's validation-first approach; Redwood's successful path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1) aligns with STRAP's resource-first recommendation, demonstrating optimal stakeholder sequencing in practice.<br><br>• The framework distills decision logic with the key formula $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ as a handy guide: when _underage costs dominate (disappointing customers is costlier)_ – high $r$, supplier-first is optimal; when _overage costs dominate (wasted resources are costlier)_ – low $r$, customer-first is optimal, serving as a quick reference for entrepreneurs to categorize their venture and apply the theory with confidence.|
