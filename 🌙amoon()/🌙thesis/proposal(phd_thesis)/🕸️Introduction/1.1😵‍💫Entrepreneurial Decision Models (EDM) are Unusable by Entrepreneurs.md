## The Fundamental Challenge

Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs in environments characterized by extreme uncertainty, multi-stakeholder interactions, and sequence-dependent outcomes. Despite decades of academic research developing entrepreneurial decision models (EDMs), practicing entrepreneurs rarely adopt these models in their actual decision processes. This creates a troubling gap between theory and practice that undermines both entrepreneurial success and scholarly advancement.

## Mathematical Formulation of the Problem

At its core, the Entrepreneurial Decision Model for Navigating Outcomes (EDMNO) can be mathematically represented as:

**Definition (EDMNO):** Given rational matrices $A_t$ ($N \times M$) and $R_t$ ($N \times P$), rational vectors $b_t$ ($M$) and $c_t$ ($P$) for $t \in 1, \ldots, T$, a set of opportunity states $\textcolor{blue}{\Omega} = {\textcolor{blue}{\omega_1}, \ldots, \textcolor{blue}{\omega_Q}}$, a non-additive uncertainty function $\textcolor{blue}{U}: \mathbb{R}^{P \times T} \times \textcolor{blue}{\Omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a rational number $L$, does there exist a sequence of integral vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_T$ (each of length $N$) such that $A_tx_t \leq b_t$ for all $t$, and $\textcolor{blue}{U}({R_tx_t - c_t}_{t=1}^T, \textcolor{blue}{\omega}) \leq L$ for some $\textcolor{blue}{\omega} \in \textcolor{blue}{\Omega}$, where $\textcolor{blue}{U}$ is non-additive in its first argument and represents uncertainty to be minimized?

	This can be simplified to our working notation:

$\arg\min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \textcolor{violet}{W_d} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{violet}{W_s} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{violet}{W_i} \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$
s.t.
1. $B\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}]$
2. $C\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#3399FF}R$
3. $\textcolor{blue}{D}(\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}$

Where:

- $\textcolor{red}{A}$ represents the action space (entrepreneur's decisions)
- $\textcolor{green}{S}$ represents the state space (venture context)
- $\textcolor{violet}{W}$ represents stakeholder (on demand, supply, capital side - customer, operational resource partner, investor) preference weights
- $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ represents uncertainty metrics to be minimized
- $B$ maps states to uncertainty measures
- $C$ maps actions to resource requirements
- $D$ is the state transition function

This formulation aligns with the "de-risking by milestones" mindset that entrepreneurs typically employ, where the goal is to minimize weighted uncertainties across different dimensions (development, stakeholder, institutional) rather than maximizing abstract utility.

**Theorem 1:** EDMNO is NP-complete, making it computationally intractable in its full form.

## The Usability Paradox

This mathematical formulation reveals the fundamental paradox: as EDMs increase in reality fit (capturing more of the complex multi-stakeholder, multi-period dynamics entrepreneurs actually face), they decrease in computational tractability. Entrepreneurs find themselves caught between models that are:

1. **Too simple**: Single-stakeholder, static models with high tractability but poor reality fit
2. **Too complex**: Multi-stakeholder with multiple operational variables that have high reality fit but intractable computation requirements

This creates a "tractability-reality gap" in the middle where entrepreneurs abandon formal modeling altogether, reverting to intuition, imitation, or simplified heuristics that fail to capture critical decision dynamics instead of developing their own entrepreneurial style by experimenting with their unique operating environment. Without appropriate modeling tools, entrepreneurs cannot systematically learn from their context, preventing the emergence of personalized decision approaches adapted to their specific venture and market conditions.
