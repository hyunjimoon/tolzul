In terms of **framing the final narrative** to motivate understanding of PCS theory, the manuscript could leverage the contrast in a storyline format. For example, one effective approach might be to **open with the Segway saga** as a cautionary tale – painting a narrative of an innovation that began with world-changing promise but faltered due to fragmented perception, haphazard sequencing, and poor coordination. Detailing a few key scenes (Segway’s hyped unveiling, the lack of a defined user need, the regulatory roadblocks) will immediately ground readers in real-world stakes and naturally raise the question: “What went wrong, and how could it have been done differently?” This sets the stage by implicitly introducing the PCS components as critical factors. The manuscript can then **pivot to the Sublime Systems story** as a contemporary contrast that answers that question. By narrating how Sublime’s founders approached a very different but equally daunting innovation challenge with a methodical, phased strategy, the author can illustrate each PCS element in practice. For instance, the text might describe how _perception_ played a role – Sublime identified that the key to unlocking progress was convincing a third-party lab of their cement’s viability (thus zeroing in on the right problem to solve first). Then, it can show _sequencing_ – how they staged their experiments and engagements in a clever order (e.g. conducting internal tests to gather data, then simultaneously showing results to regulators, customers, and investors) instead of rushing a big launch. Finally, _coordination_ comes through in anecdotes like Sublime aligning an ecosystem of partners (testing agencies, pilot customers, and funding sources) all in concert, leading to milestones such as the net-zero building demo pour and accelerated funding[news.mit.edu](https://news.mit.edu/2024/sustainable-cement-startup-sublime-eliminates-co2-gigatons-0809#:~:text=In%20May%2C%20Sublime%20reached%20a,online%20as%20early%20as%202026). By weaving these episodes together, the narrative demonstrates how each step of the PCS framework directly contributed to Sublime’s momentum – essentially providing a positive mirror image to the Segway story.

The **juxtaposition** of the two cases can be a powerful framing device throughout the manuscript. After explaining each PCS stage via Sublime’s case, the author might briefly **reflect back to Segway** – e.g., “Had Segway’s team applied such concurrent stakeholder coordination, they might have foreseen and mitigated the infrastructure and regulatory issues that later stymied adoption[innovationmanagement.se](https://innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/02/a-lesson-in-innovation-why-did-the-segway-fail/#:~:text=2,user%20feedback%20or%20iteration%20in)[innovationmanagement.se](https://innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/02/a-lesson-in-innovation-why-did-the-segway-fail/#:~:text=5,it%20was%20not%20properly%20anticipated).” These comparative insights reinforce the theory: readers see clearly how _Perception, Sequencing,_ and _Coordination_ are not just abstract terms but the very differentiators between a stalled innovation and a thriving one. In conclusion, **Sublime+Segway** provides the most instructive and engaging pairing. It allows the final narrative to be framed as a lesson in contrasts – from a famous failure to an emerging success – thereby compellingly motivating why the PCS framework matters. By the end of the manuscript, an innovation scholar reading it should intuitively grasp the PCS theory, remembering how each component was embodied in the rise of a climate-tech solution and conspicuously missing in the fall of a once-hyped gadget. Such a narrative not only **grounds the theoretical framework in storytelling** but also inspires a deeper appreciation of strategic foresight in innovation management, which is exactly the goal of illustrating the PCS theory with real cases.
