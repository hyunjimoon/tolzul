Three interrelated factors contribute to the unusability of current EDMs, each with significant consequences at a different level of analysis. At the fundamental **nature of the problem** level, the inherent trade-off between model tractability and reality-fit means that formal models tend to be either overly simplistic or overwhelmingly complex; consequently, entrepreneurs often **abandon formal modeling** in favor of intuition, imitation, or ad hoc heuristics. At the **individual** level, entrepreneurs’ idiosyncratic initial conditions and the cognitive difficulty of inferring both their own and others’ preferences render one-size-fits-all models ineffective – leading individuals to revert to copying others’ strategies and hindering the development of a personalized decision-making style. At the **institutional** level, insufficient modeling education for entrepreneurs and weak coordination between ventures and public stakeholders result in **fragmented, non-cumulative learning** and planning failures on a broader scale. Each of these problem dimensions is examined in depth in Section [[2.Nature of problem]], Section [[4.Individual level of problem]], and Section [[6.Institutional level of problem]], respectively, underscoring the need for new approaches to bridge this usability gap.

To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a three-pronged framework of solutions, summarized in the table below.

Table 1.3 A three-solution framework addressing temporal (<span style="color:red">red</span>), spatial (<span style="color:green">green</span>), and spatio-temporal (<span style="color:violet">violet</span>) complexities in entrepreneurial decision models through phase-based learning, proactive hypothesis testing, and calibrated federated learning approaches.

This table presents a comprehensive framework for addressing key complexities in entrepreneurial decision models through three integrated solutions. The <span style="color:red">red-coded phase-based learning approach</span> tackles temporal complexity by transforming overly simplistic or overly complex strategies into modularized operational models with sub-path formulations. The <span style="color:green">green-coded proactive hypothesis proposal methodology</span> addresses spatial complexity by evolving causal inference into participatory value modeling through probabilistic programming techniques. Finally, the <span style="color:violet">violet-coded calibrated federated learning system</span> combines both temporal and spatial dimensions by replacing unstructured approaches with bounded probability distributions that enable dynamic consistency through milestone-based coordination between entrepreneurs and social planners. Together, these color-coded solutions form a robust toolkit for enhancing model usability across the different complexity dimensions of entrepreneurial decision-making.

- you mentioned "1.Experimental (proactive)" is impractical or infeasible, but this is very usual in entrepreneurship where previous collected data hints the next experiment. I believe ultimate outcome of every model should be an action that triggers data based on which next action is chosen. Incidentally I don't trust any data collected by others (measurement issues) so my preference is experimental > hypothetical > observational
