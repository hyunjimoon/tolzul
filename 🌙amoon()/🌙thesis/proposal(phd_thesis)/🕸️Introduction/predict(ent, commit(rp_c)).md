### 2.1 Strategic Approach: Modeling Stakeholder Acceptance and Venture Commitment State

Input: We formalize stakeholder acceptance by Resource Partners (RP) and Customers (C) as probabilistic outcomes. These probabilities, pr​ for RP acceptance and pc​ for Customer acceptance, are modeled using a choice framework reflecting their respective utilities (URP​,UC​) as perceived by the entrepreneur or the stakeholders themselves: pr​=eURP​/(eURP​+eUC​) and pc​=eUC​/(eURP​+eUC​). This formulation ensures pr​+pc​=1, treating the engagement outcomes as a complete set of alternatives influenced by an underlying "quality" or combined utility proposition that the venture offers. These probabilities represent the measurable likelihood of success from entrepreneurial engagement efforts with either stakeholder group. pr = f(URP) and pc = f(UC), where the functional form f(·) could be logistic, probit, or another probability transformation. By modeling utilities as URP = β0RP + β1RP·price + β2RP·quality and UC = β0C + β1C·price + β2C·quality, we capture three distinct stakeholder relationship scenarios: (1) **Substitutive** when value propositions that attract one stakeholder repel the other (e.g., high prices attract resource partners but deter customers), (2) **Complementary** when the same value proposition attracts both stakeholders (e.g., high quality signals attract both sides), and (3) **Independent** when stakeholder decisions are driven by separate factors. 

Process: We define a critical venture state, the 'Venture Commitment State' (D), which encapsulates the fundamental newsvendor tension inherent in matching resource commitments (supply-side) with customer commitments (demand-side) within the entrepreneurial context. This state is precisely modeled as the outcome of probabilistic engagements: D=2⋅Bernoulli(pc​)−1, where pc​ is the probability of customer acceptance. Consequently, D=1 signifies that customer commitments have been secured without commensurate resource backing (an _underage_ position), an outcome occurring with probability pc​. Conversely, D=−1 indicates that resource commitments are in place but corresponding customer demand has not materialized (an _overage_ position), occurring with probability pr​=1−pc​. This framework, based on the 'Venture Commitment State' D, progressively accommodates deterministic scenarios (where pc​∈{0,1}), stochastic scenarios (where pc​∈(0,1) as derived from the underlying choice model influencing acceptance probabilities), and interdependent scenarios. In interdependent situations, the utilities (URP​ or UC​) that determine pc​ (and thus pr​) become conditional on prior venture states or other stakeholder acceptances, leading to state-dependent transition probabilities characteristic of an implied Markovian process governing the venture's ongoing evolution. **D = Venture Commitment State** captures the fundamental newsvendor tension of matching supply with demand, but in the entrepreneurial context of matching stakeholder commitments. Just as the newsvendor observes uncertain newspaper demand and must decide inventory levels before demand realizes, entrepreneurs face uncertain stakeholder commitments and must sequence engagements before knowing who will commit. Based on predicted commitment probabilities (pr, pc), entrepreneurs prescribe the optimal engagement sequence, and D represents the realized state after executing this prediction-based action: D = 1 means customer commitments without resource backing (underage—like having more newspaper demand than inventory), while D = -1 means resource commitments without customer demand (overage—like having newspapers left unsold). The critical insight is that entrepreneurial "inventory" consists of commitments from supply and demand sides that only create value when matched—similar to platform markets where value emerges from successful matches between sides. This framework handles deterministic scenarios (pc ∈ {0,1}), stochastic scenarios (0 < pc < 1), and interdependent scenarios where utilities become conditional on prior venture states or other stakeholder commitments. 


Entrepreneurial actions—specifically, the decision to engage either RPs or Cs—thus lead to probabilistic transitions into these D=1 or D=−1 outcome states. A persistent state of D=1 without adequate resources leads to accumulating underage costs (Cu​), such as missed sales or reputational damage. Conversely, securing resources that result in a D=−1 state (e.g., capacity ready) without subsequent customer uptake implies overage costs (Co​), like idle capacity or wasted investment. Understanding these state transitions, whether as isolated events or as part of a broader Markov chain of sequential decisions and evolving probabilities, is crucial for computing these mismatch costs and thereby avoiding false positives in strategic prioritization efforts.



The entrepreneur designs value propositions characterized by attributes that influence stakeholder utilities. These utilities—URP for Resource Partners and UC for Customers—capture how attractive the venture appears to each stakeholder group based on factors like price, quality, market potential, and strategic fit. The entrepreneur can adjust these value proposition attributes (e.g., offering higher revenue shares to resource partners or lower prices to customers) to influence the underlying utilities that drive stakeholder acceptance decisions.

D = 1:stocked promises—customer commitments without resource backing
D = -1: "stocked capacity" (resource commitments without customer demand)

# output
The value proposition design yields acceptance probabilities (pr, pc) and defines the venture's exposure to commitment mismatch costs. A persistent D = 1 state accumulates underage costs Cu (missed sales, reputational damage from unfulfilled promises), while a D = -1 state incurs overage costs Co (idle capacity, wasted resource investments). These probabilistic outcomes and associated costs form the inputs for the second-stage prioritization decision, establishing how value proposition choices create the stochastic environment entrepreneurs must navigate.
