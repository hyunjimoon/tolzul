## LC0: Stakeholder Utility Complexity validating C0

The root complexity of stakeholder sequencing stems from the stochastic and interdependent nature of stakeholder commitments, which violates the separability assumptions underlying traditional decision theory. Research on entrepreneurial heterogeneity demonstrates that "business performance is not homogeneous" even among similar ventures, as stakeholder responses vary unpredictably based on factors ranging from market timing to competitive dynamics [[📜naiki24_eff(ent)]]. More critically, stakeholder utilities exhibit strong interdependence: customers' willingness to adopt depends on supplier participation, while suppliers' commitment hinges on demonstrated customer demand—creating circular dependencies that defy linear optimization. This interdependence manifests empirically in venture competitions where "disagreement among judges predicts startup success," suggesting that stakeholder evaluation itself involves complex, non-separable utility functions. The stochastic element compounds this complexity: even identical approaches to the same stakeholder type yield different outcomes based on unobservable state variables like internal politics, budget cycles, or competitive pressures. Recent work conceptualizing opportunities as "evolving artifacts" reveals how stakeholder commitments dynamically reshape the opportunity itself, making each interaction potentially path-altering rather than simply probabilistic [[📜sarooghi24_hetero(entopp)]]. This combination of stochasticity and interdependence transforms stakeholder sequencing from a simple ordering problem into a complex adaptive system where each action irreversibly alters the landscape for subsequent moves.

## **LP1: Entrepreneurial Evaluation Incapacity** validating C1

Given this complex environment, entrepreneurs who recognize the criticality of stakeholder sequencing systematically fail to evaluate which interactions to prioritize due to fundamental feedback attribution problems. Field experiments comparing scientific and heuristic approaches to entrepreneurship reveal that entrepreneurs struggle to "elaborate information to make entrepreneurial decisions," often conflating correlation with causation when interpreting stakeholder responses. This evaluation incapacity stems not from lack of data—modern entrepreneurs track countless metrics—but from the inability to establish causal links between specific actions and observed outcomes in noisy, multi-stakeholder environments. Systematic review of entrepreneurial decision-making shows entrepreneurs resort to "heuristics that positively or negatively exploit information" precisely because rigorous evaluation of action-outcome relationships proves computationally intractable. The problem intensifies under time pressure: entrepreneurs facing runway constraints must make rapid sequencing decisions without clear feedback loops, leading to what ecological rationality research identifies as systematic switching between "causal and effectual logics" based on perceived rather than actual decision outcomes. This creates a vicious cycle where inability to evaluate past actions undermines future decision-making, causing entrepreneurs to oscillate between stakeholder groups without systematic progress—what practitioners recognize as "thrashing" between customer and supplier development without clear strategic direction.

## **LP2: Operational Optimization Gaps** validating C2

While operations management has developed sophisticated tools for capacity planning, inventory optimization, and process control, these remain fundamentally disconnected from the entrepreneurial reality of stakeholder sequencing under extreme uncertainty. Despite decades of research, Fine et al. (2022) observe that OM tools designed for "large, established firms" fail to address how "the operations needs of new ventures might differ," particularly in stakeholder prioritization decisions. Traditional OM assumes entrepreneurs can specify objective functions, estimate parameters, and execute optimization—assumptions that crumble when facing stochastic stakeholder responses and interdependent utilities. Critical ratio analysis, for instance, requires known demand distributions and deterministic lead times, neither of which exist in early-stage ventures navigating stakeholder commitment. Even when OM researchers ask the right questions—"how do emerging entrepreneurial firms create efficiencies of scale"—the resulting frameworks fragment into isolated tools for production, distribution, and sourcing without integration logic. Real options theory comes closest to addressing entrepreneurial uncertainty but stops short of providing "decision logic" for when to exercise options or how to sequence stakeholder engagements. The result is a toolbox without instructions: entrepreneurs possess numerous analytical frameworks but lack the operational rules to synthesize them into actionable sequencing decisions. This gap between analytical capability and prescriptive guidance leaves entrepreneurs defaulting to intuition precisely when systematic decision-making matters most, contributing directly to the high failure rates documented in Cluster 1.

Belief-Based Model Constraints** | Show even advanced Bayesian models can’t prescribe actions due to belief assumptions | **Search strategy:** Find papers assuming **shared beliefs** or modeling belief divergence but failing to resolve how entrepreneurs act under disagreement. Use search phrases like “Bayesian updating in entrepreneurship”, “belief heterogeneity strategic implications”, “prior convergence assumption in startup modeling”. One key tactic: look for discussions of the **Aumann agreement theorem**, or cite **Homo Entrepreneuricus** to introduce the **subjective prior + theory-based experimentation** archetype. This cluster is also where you frame your rejection of traditional “bounded rationality” by instead introducing **resource rationality**. Look for papers that go beyond heuristics-as-errors and model **bounded optimality** (e.g. Lieder, Griffiths). Use this to argue: “Entrepreneurs aren’t irrational — they’re **computationally constrained**. Their failure to prioritize the right stakeholder isn’t about psychology; it’s about structure.” This provides an elegant philosophical and methodological justification for STRAP’s shift to observable state-based modeling. |                          |

Target **review papers** or special issue intros (like Fine et al. 2022) that catalogue tools but lament the lack of prescriptive logic. Ideal papers state: “We have tools, but founders don’t know when/how to use them.” You can pair this with **Anderson & Parker (2013)** as a positive example of an integrated model applied to startups (cospecialization optimization). Together, these sources confirm your gap: _Entrepreneurs lack a unifying operational model that adapts to uncertainty and stakeholder dynamics_. STRAP fills this hole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                          |
