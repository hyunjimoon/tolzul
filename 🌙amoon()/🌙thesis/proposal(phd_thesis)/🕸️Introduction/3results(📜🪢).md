After summarizing the decision rules derived from [[2methods(📜🪢, s(p1))]], we use retrospective analysis. Intention is to illustrate the process of formulating and solving the optimization problem which includes 1) calculation of overage and underage cost, 2) judging the type of situation they are in (how stochastic or interdependent) to make them confident in applying our proposed theory in their decision analysis (for academics) or decision making (practitioners). To refrain from making (incorrect) normative suggestions of past situation where we lack information access, we changed the first name of each company: from webvan, tesla, betterplace to xeban, sesla, cetterplace. 

1. describe the main logic of # code in six paragraphs.

first three paragraphs explain the

- 1) logic choose then move to optimize (+ four moves to belong in optimal quadrant)

- 2) logic behind two types of movement along pr (increase pr for ⬆️move1 and decrease pr for ⬇️move3)

- 3) logic behind two types of movement along cr (increase cr for ➡️move2 and decrease cr for ⬅️move4)

next three paragraphs explain the examples.

- 4) success cases by focusing on customer (e.g. tesla's partnering with xcellent)

- 5) success cases by focusing on resource parter (e.g. anwell)

- 6) failure cases by stuck in the middle


# 3. STRAP Decision Framework and Illustrative Cases


 Table  summarizes the critical inputs for each case, and Figure visualizes their trajectories and outcomes:

[[🖼️(results(📜🪢))_v1.png]]
Figure situates these cases on the STRAP decision map. The top panel shows the **Critical Ratio Decision Framework**, dividing the strategy space into a _Supplier-First Zone (blue, $r>0.5$)_ and a _Customer-First Zone (green, $r<0.5$)_. Each venture is plotted by its estimated $r$: Tesla around 0.60 in the supplier-first zone (blue point), Webvan ~0.30 and Better Place ~0.06 in the customer-first zone (green points). The actual approaches taken are noted (Tesla actually went more customer-first, Webvan “both-extreme,” Better Place supplier-first extreme) along with the costs incurred. The middle panel illustrates **state transition sequences** and cost outcomes for each case: Tesla’s actual path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) incurred an underage cost of $3.8M, whereas STRAP would have suggested (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1) avoiding that cost; Better Place’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 0,0 failure) cost $850M and could have been replaced by a STRAP path (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) with staged growth; Webvan’s path (0,0 → 1,0 → 1,1* → 0,0 collapse) burned through $1B, whereas STRAP would advise (0,0 → 0,1 → 1,1) scaling only after validation.The bottom panel distills the **STRAP decision logic** with definitions: it emphasizes that when _underage costs dominate (disappointing customers is costlier)_ – i.e. high $r$, supplier-first is optimal; when _overage costs dominate (wasted resources are costlier)_ – low $r$, customer-first is optimal. Each case’s numbers exemplify these situations. The key formula $r = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}$ is provided as a handy guide. Together, these visuals serve as a quick reference for entrepreneurs to categorize their venture and glean the recommended sequencing strategy at a glance. 


# Utility & Cost Strategy Framework

This table directly translates the whiteboard structure, outlining four strategic scenarios based on the manipulation of utility and cost variables. The explanations and examples are drawn from the provided transcript.
