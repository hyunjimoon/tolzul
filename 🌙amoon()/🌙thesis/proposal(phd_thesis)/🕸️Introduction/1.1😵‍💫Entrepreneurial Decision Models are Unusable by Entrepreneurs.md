Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs under extreme uncertainty, across multiple stakeholders, and in a sequence-dependent environment. While numerous formal models (EDMs) exist in the academic literature, entrepreneurs rarely apply them, resulting in a persistent gap between theoretical advances and practical usage. This section formalizes that gap as a tractability-reality paradox: models with high reality fit (multiple stakeholders, operations, and time steps) become computationally intractable (NP-complete), while tractable models fail to capture entrepreneurial realities.

We define this central problem through the EDMNO formulation:

$$
\arg\min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \textcolor{purple}{W_d} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i} \cdot \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad B\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}], \quad C\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}, \quad D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}
$$

Each component reflects a different modeling dimension. entrepreneurs operate not to maximize utility, but to minimize stakeholder-specific uncertainties in sequence during early stage as they don't have profit function. We propose that usable models must focus on this milestone-based uncertainty reduction logic. Instead of assuming entrepreneurs are passive recipients of externally built models, we treat them as cognitive agents capable of engaging with structured, simplified representations that reduce residual uncertainty across three stakeholder dimensions (ambiguity in action selection). The goal of the thesis is to build such tractable mid-complexity frameworks.

**Variables:**
- $\textcolor{red}{A}$: actions (segment, collaborate, capitalize)    
- $\textcolor{green}{S}$: stakeholder acceptance state (e.g., [0,1,0])
- $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$: residual uncertainties per stakeholder
- $\textcolor{purple}{W}$: stakeholder importance weights; $\textcolor{purple}{W_D}$, $\textcolor{purple}{W_S}$, $\textcolor{purple}{W_C}$: weights for demand-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_D}$), supply-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_S}$), and capital-side ($\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_C}$) uncertainty.
- $C$: maps actions to cost
- $B$: maps state to stakeholder uncertainty
- $D$: maps current state and action to next state

**Constraints:**
   * $B \, \textcolor{green}{S} = \textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$: Relates the current **state** $\textcolor{green}{S}$ to the level of uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$. (**B:** How the current state directly translates into uncertainty levels.)
   * $C \, \textcolor{red}{A} = R$: Relates chosen **actions** $\textcolor{red}{A}$ to **resources or costs** $R$. (**C:** Cost or resource implications of actions taken.)
   * $D \, \textcolor{red}{A} \, \textcolor{green}{S} = 0$: Captures dynamics ensuring actions and states are consistent (no internal contradictions in decision-state combinations). (**D:** Dynamic consistency‚Äîensuring chosen actions make sense given the current states.)

## The Fundamental Challenge

Entrepreneurial decision-making occurs in environments characterized by extreme uncertainty, multi-stakeholder interactions, and sequence-dependent outcomes. Despite decades of academic research developing entrepreneurial decision models (EDMs), practicing entrepreneurs rarely adopt these models in their actual decision processes. This creates a troubling gap between theory and practice that undermines both entrepreneurial success and scholarly advancement.

## Mathematical Formulation of the Problem

At its core, the Entrepreneurial Decision Model for Navigating Outcomes (EDMNO) can be mathematically represented as:

**Definition (EDMNO):** Given rational matrices $A_t$ ($N \times M$) and $R_t$ ($N \times P$), rational vectors $b_t$ ($M$) and $c_t$ ($P$) for $t \in 1, \ldots, T$, a set of opportunity states $\textcolor{blue}{\Omega} = {\textcolor{blue}{\omega_1}, \ldots, \textcolor{blue}{\omega_Q}}$, a non-additive uncertainty function $\textcolor{blue}{U}: \mathbb{R}^{P \times T} \times \textcolor{blue}{\Omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a rational number $L$, does there exist a sequence of integral vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_T$ (each of length $N$) such that $A_tx_t \leq b_t$ for all $t$, and $\textcolor{blue}{U}({R_tx_t - c_t}_{t=1}^T, \textcolor{blue}{\omega}) \leq L$ for some $\textcolor{blue}{\omega} \in \textcolor{blue}{\Omega}$, where $\textcolor{blue}{U}$ is non-additive in its first argument and represents uncertainty to be minimized?

	This can be simplified to our working notation:

**Theorem 1:** EDMNO is NP-complete, making it computationally intractable in its full form.

## The Usability Paradox

This mathematical formulation reveals the fundamental paradox: as EDMs increase in reality fit (capturing more of the complex multi-stakeholder, multi-period dynamics entrepreneurs actually face), they decrease in computational tractability. Entrepreneurs find themselves caught between models that are:

1. **Too simple**: Single-stakeholder, static models with high tractability but poor reality fit
2. **Too complex**: Multi-stakeholder with multiple operational variables that have high reality fit but intractable computation requirements

This creates a "tractability-reality gap" in the middle where entrepreneurs abandon formal modeling altogether, reverting to intuition, imitation, or simplified heuristics that fail to capture critical decision dynamics.

## Consequences of the Usability Problem

The inability to use formal decision models leads to three critical consequences for entrepreneurial practice:

1. **Imitative rather than experimental behavior**: Without tractable models to guide systematic experimentation, entrepreneurs default to copying what appears to work for others, even when contexts differ significantly. This prevents the development of venture-specific approaches and reinforces survivorship bias.
    
2. **Non-cumulative optimal solutions**: Each entrepreneur faces similar challenges but cannot build on predecessors' learning experiences. Solutions remain isolated and context-specific rather than contributing to generalizable knowledge that could benefit future ventures.
    
3. **Abandonment of modeling and measurement**: As formal models prove unusable, entrepreneurs reject structured decision-making entirely. This leads to purely intuitive approaches that cannot be systematically improved, measured, or taught to others.

Without appropriate modeling tools, entrepreneurs cannot systematically learn from their context, preventing the emergence of personalized decision approaches adapted to their specific venture and market conditions.
