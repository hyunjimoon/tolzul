### **ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ§DG23-28** - Results Setup & Technical Validation

**Role:** Present the results through structured optimization scenarios that demonstrate the methodology's power and flexibility.

**Instructions:**

- D23-D25: Present three optimization scenarios - given responsiveness coefficient and cost parameter, optimize quality; given responsiveness coefficient and quality, optimize cost parameter; given cost parameter and quality, optimize responsiveness coefficient
- D26-D28: Provide setup context for results interpretation and practical application
- G23-G28: Technical details supporting the optimization scenarios with mathematical validation
- Demonstrate how the methodology handles different entrepreneurial decision contexts with equal rigor
