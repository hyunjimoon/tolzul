## The Problem: Decision Frameworks That Don't Work

Imagine trying to navigate an unfamiliar city without GPS or maps—this is the reality for today's entrepreneurs. Despite entrepreneurship's importance to innovation and economic growth, entrepreneurs lack usable decision frameworks. My interview with 50+ innovation organizations, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs educators, investors revealed a troubling pattern: accelerators and incubators operate without coherent playbooks that can guide real-world decisions under uncertainty.

This creates three devastating consequences:

- Entrepreneurs resort to copying others rather than systematic experimentation
- Knowledge remains trapped in isolated successes rather than accumulating across ventures
- Measurement and modeling are abandoned for pure intuition

## The Fundamental Challenge: Multiple Stakeholders, Limited Resources

Traditional definitions portraying entrepreneurs as pursuing "opportunities without regard to resources" fundamentally misunderstand successful entrepreneurship. In reality, entrepreneurs face two interrelated challenges:

1. **Different stakeholders perceive ventures differently** - What seems promising to a technical founder may appear risky to an investor
2. **Resources are severely constrained** - Every experiment consumes precious time, money and social capital

These challenges create a decision environment where entrepreneurs must carefully model stakeholder perceptions while optimizing limited resources to reduce critical uncertainties.

## A New Framework: Perception Modeling + Resource Optimization

My research introduces a framework that transforms entrepreneurial decision-making by modeling stakeholder perceptions and optimizing resource allocation to systematically reduce critical uncertainties. This approach provides practical tools that balance mathematical rigor with real-world usability.



Figure 1 visualizes this approach, showing how entrepreneurs can navigate the tension between comprehensive modeling and practical decision-making. The framework offers a path forward that respects both the complexity of entrepreneurial environments and the practical constraints entrepreneurs face daily.

### 1.1 The Entrepreneurial Decision Challenge
Entrepreneurial decision making is fundamental to human experience, driven by both emotional and practical motivations. At its core, entrepreneurial decision making begins with selective optimism about specific opportunities ([[📜stern24_bayesent]]). This optimism is natural to human experience - as Hyde ([[📜hyde_twister_makes_world]]) notes, without some self-deception, life would be merely "a terrible, useless procedure bracketed by orgasm and putrefaction." The entrepreneurial decision process involves universal cognitive skills: envisioning possibilities, framing reality, applying logic, planning intentionally, and taking action to navigate uncertainty  ([[📜dimo]]). What makes entrepreneurial decision making distinctly human is how it channels our innate drive for cooperation and pro-social motivation into collaborative problem-solving that creates shared value (Tomasello, 2022) .

Beyond human motivations, entrepreneurial decision making offers crucial economic and existential value. Economically, transportation innovations represent massive opportunity—the sector accounts for 3.2% of US GDP with emerging models showing remarkable efficiency gains (ridesharing platforms achieve 30-50% higher utilization than traditional systems) [[📜choe22_transpo_innov_drivers]]. Existentially, transportation's carbon footprint makes entrepreneurial climate solutions imperative for planetary survival—global CO₂ emissions continue rising sharply, with China and developing economies driving significant increases. Yet entrepreneurs tackling these challenges face substantial barriers: high capital requirements, limited intellectual property protection, and extreme uncertainty that traditional decision models fail to address. This creates a critical disconnect between entrepreneurial decision making's potential and its practice, particularly in high-impact domains where multi-stakeholder collaboration is essential. Improving entrepreneurial decision frameworks that integrate belief-driven dynamics could accelerate vital innovations across human, economic, and existential dimensions—making this work both practically urgent and intellectually significant.

Having established entrepreneurial decision making's fundamental importance across human, economic, and existential domains, I must highlight a critical gap: existing entrepreneurial decision models fail practitioners in real-world contexts. My interviews with innovation program leaders reveal that over 80 different organizations and accelerators operate without coherent playbooks or frameworks that integrate multi-stakeholder perspectives and operational variables. This disconnect between theory and practice severely hampers innovation, particularly in mobility ventures which are sits at the intersection between AI, robotics, climate tech where complex stakeholder ecosystems demand sophisticated collaboration models.

### 1.3 Research Goals and Societal Impact

The short-term goal of my thesis is to address this urgent need through a three-stage approach: first demonstrating to stakeholders (committee members) the problem's multidimensional significance, then identifying its structural causes, and finally proposing feasible Bayesian solutions that recognize how beliefs shape experimentation and collaboration. My mid-term goal is to implement and evaluate this framework across diverse innovation environments (designX in the U.S., HPI in Germany, SMART Innovation Center in Singapore), measuring success through three key metrics: flexibility in accommodating multiple decision pathways, efficiency in reducing uncertainty per resource invested, and tractability of progress throughout the venture development process.

The long-term goal of this work extends beyond my thesis to establish foundations for solution-oriented social science in entrepreneurial contexts ([[📜watts]]). Drawing inspiration from successful entrepreneurs who execute staged, iterative master plans to achieve transformative impact ([[📜gans20_choose(tech)]] e.g. 1. Build sports car, 2. Use that money to build an affordable car, 3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car, 4. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options, my master plan is 1. build tool for entrepreneurial decision making), my research strategy focuses on building increasingly sophisticated tools for entrepreneurial decision making. This deliberate sequencing begins with creating targeted frameworks for specific high-stakes domains like climate technology, then systematically expanding their application to broader entrepreneurial challenges. By developing practical decision models that integrate Bayesian inference, integer / linear programming, and computational approaches implemented through probabilistic /dynamic programming, I aim to create tools that enhance decision making in domains characterized by operational uncertainty and multiple stakeholders. This work connects directly to the broader societal need for more effective entrepreneurial approaches to complex global problems, providing a foundation for tackling multifaceted challenges that require coordinated action across diverse stakeholders and uncertain technological landscapes.

## Consequences of the Usability Problem

![[1.1😵‍💫Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.svg|200]] %%[[1.1😵‍💫Entrepreneurial Decision Models (EDM) are Unusable by Entrepreneurs 2025-04-28-10.md|🖋 Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

The "Usability Paradox" in entrepreneurial decision-making (EDM) highlights a fundamental tension: highly realistic models capturing multi-stakeholder and dynamic complexities become computationally intractable, whereas simpler models, though computationally feasible, fail to reflect entrepreneurial realities. This paradox results in a problematic "tractability-reality gap," causing entrepreneurs to abandon formal modeling in favor of intuition, imitation, and heuristics. Consequently, ventures often imitate rather than experiment, neglecting context-specific insights and reinforcing survivorship bias; entrepreneurial learning remains fragmented and non-cumulative, restricting broader knowledge development; and structured modeling is frequently discarded altogether, impeding systematic improvement, measurement, and dissemination of effective entrepreneurial practices tailored to unique venture contexts.

### Progressive Spectrum of Model Complexity

The trade-off between tractability and reality fit creates a fundamental tension in entrepreneurial decision modeling. As I examine the spectrum from simple to complex models, I observe:

|Model Type|Multi-Stakeholder Complexity|Dynamic Operational Complexity|Tractability|Reality Fit|Key References|Need for New Approach|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Single-Stakeholder Static Strategy**|No|No|High|Poor|Sarasvathy (2001); McMullen & Shepherd (2006)|Low (simple, manageable but lacks realism)|
|**Single-Stakeholder Dynamic Operations**|No|Yes|Medium-High|Moderate|Håkansson (1971); McGrath (1999)|Low (manageable by traditional methods)|
|**Multi-Stakeholder Static Strategy**|Yes|No|Medium|Moderate|Van den Steen (2016); Gans, Hsu & Stern (2002)|Medium (requires stakeholder negotiation)|
|**Multi-Stakeholder Dynamic Operations**|Yes|Yes|Low|High|Schindehutte & Morris (2009); Garud & Karnøe (2003)|High (complexity strains traditional methods)|

As temporal complexity (uncertainty unfolding over time) and spatial complexity (number of interacting stakeholders/variables) increase, models better represent reality but become increasingly intractable. At the highest complexity levels—precisely where real entrepreneurial decisions exist—traditional models become unusable (Schindehutte & Morris, 2009).

> Thm.1 Entrepreneurial decision making model with objective that is nonlinear and opportunity dependent is NP-complete
proof: [[Appendix#Appendix D]]

The fundamental entrepreneurial decision problem combines two sources of computational complexity:

1. **Resource Allocation (Inequality Constraints)**: Optimize resource usage subject to budget constraints
   - Captured by: Σⱼ cⱼaⱼ ≤ R
   - Complexity: Linear programming (polynomial time)

2. **Multi-Stakeholder Interactions (Integrality Constraints)**: Handle discrete, interdependent decisions
   - Captured by: aⱼ ∈ {0,1} (binary decisions on stakeholder engagement)
   - Complexity: Integer programming (NP-complete)

The combination creates the full problem:

minimize Σⱼ wⱼUⱼ
subject to:
- Σⱼ cⱼaⱼ ≤ R  (resource constraints)
- aⱼ ∈ {0,1}    (discrete decisions)
- Additional precedence/dependency constraints

This integer programming formulation is NP-complete, motivating our three-part framework:
- Chapter I: Dimensionality reduction through perceptual projection
- Chapter II: Exploiting problem structure in multi-stakeholder coordination  
- Chapter III: Near-optimal approximations via bottleneck breaking

Just as integer programming becomes NP-complete when discrete constraints meet continuous inequalities, entrepreneurial decision-making exhibits a parallel complexity structure where combining operational and multi-stakeholder constraints creates computational intractability. Part I addresses operational complexity alone through "Bottleneck Breaking," where entrepreneurs facing resource constraints can efficiently prioritize actions using myopic decisions that target the highest uncertainty-reduction-to-cost ratio—analogous to solving linear inequalities in polynomial time. Part II tackles multi-stakeholder complexity alone through "Proactive Testing," where entrepreneurs coordinate multiple interdependent stakeholders by running parallel hypothesis tests that create positive information spillovers—similar to handling integer constraints without inequalities. However, Part III reveals that when both complexities intersect—when entrepreneurs must sequence resource-constrained actions while coordinating multiple stakeholders—the problem becomes intractable, necessitating "Expectation Propagation" as a probabilistic inference strategy. This approach iteratively calibrates beliefs between ventures and institutions through federated learning, enabling the ecosystem to handle the combined complexity that traditional optimization methods cannot address, much like how integer linear programming requires sophisticated techniques beyond those sufficient for its simpler components.

Entrepreneurial decision models span a spectrum of complexity defined by two key dimensions: **operational complexity** (decisions unfolding over time) and **multi-stakeholder complexity** (multiple interacting agents or criteria). At the simplest end of this spectrum are single-stakeholder static strategy models, which consider a one-off strategic choice by a lone decision-maker. These simple models are highly tractable but offer poor reality fit, since they ignore dynamic feedback and the involvement of other stakeholders (e.g., Sarasvathy, 2001; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Increasing the operational complexity yields single-stakeholder dynamic models that incorporate sequences of decisions and learning over time. Such models capture how an entrepreneur adapts through multiple stages (for instance, via staged investment or real options reasoning) while still focusing on one primary actor (Håkansson, 1971; McGrath, 1999).

To better reflect real venture conditions, other models introduce **multi-stakeholder complexity** even in static settings. These multi-stakeholder strategy models consider how an entrepreneur coordinates or negotiates with various actors (investors, customers, competitors) within a single decision context, adding richer criteria to the choice (Gans, Hsu & Stern, 2002; Van den Steen, 2016). This boosts reality fit by acknowledging diverse interests, but tractability remains manageable only because the decision is not sequential. The most comprehensive models embrace both interacting stakeholders and dynamic operations, portraying entrepreneurship as an ongoing process co-created with partners, markets, and investors (Schindehutte & Morris, 2009; Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Roundy, 2018). These high-complexity models achieve a strong fit to entrepreneurial reality (phenomenological richness) but become computationally intractable – indeed, the full **EDMNO** formulation that accounts for all stakeholders over time is NP-complete (as shown in Section 1.1). In essence, the progression from static single-actor to dynamic multi-actor models reveals an engineering-versus-phenomenological trade-off: as I add realism, I lose tractability.

Bridging this tractability–reality gap requires new approaches that retain high reality fit while restoring usability. Rather than abandoning formal modeling, I propose an **engineering** solution that balances these extremes through targeted simplifications and optimization strategies. In this thesis, a three-part framework is introduced to tackle each complexity dimension: **phase-based learning** breaks the decision process into stages to manage operational complexity over time, **proactive hypothesis proposal** uses probabilistic experimentation to navigate multi-stakeholder uncertainty, and **calibrated federated learning** allows entrepreneurs to collectively improve models without sacrificing individual context. Together, these strategies form a mid-complexity decision framework designed to maintain realism (capturing multi-stage, multi-stakeholder dynamics) while remaining computationally tractable. This approach sets the stage for the use cases and solution scope detailed in Section 1.3, aiming to empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

This revised table simplifies the original classification into four clear categories based on two primary axes of complexity: multi-stakeholder interactions and dynamic operational considerations. Each category succinctly captures the trade-offs between tractability and reality fit, highlighting the increasing necessity of novel approaches such as federated learning and proactive hypothesis testing as complexity intensifies, particularly in scenarios involving multiple stakeholders and dynamic operations.

## Progressive Spectrum of Model Complexity

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models becomes evident when examining the progressive spectrum of model complexity:

|Model Type|Temporal Complexity|Spatial Complexity|Tractability|Reality Fit|Need for New Approach|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Strategy-Only, Single Stakeholder**|Low|Low|High|Poor|❌ No|
|**Strategy + Time Steps, Single Stakeholder**|Medium|Low|Medium-High|Moderate|⬇️ Low|
|**Strategy + Multi-Stakeholder (Static)**|Low|Medium|Medium|Moderate|⬆️ Medium|
|**Strategy + Operations + Multi-Stakeholder (Dynamic)**|High|High|Low|High|✅ Yes|
|**Full Operational Scaling + Multi-Stakeholder**|Very High|Very High|Very Low|Very High|🚨 Critical|

As temporal complexity (uncertainty unfolding over time) and spatial complexity (number of interacting stakeholders/variables) increase, the model better represents reality but becomes increasingly intractable. At the highest complexity levels—precisely where real entrepreneurial decisions exist—traditional models become unusable.
- **Temporal Complexity** = How much uncertainty unfolds over time.
- **Spatial Complexity** = How many stakeholders/variables interact.
- **Reality Fit** = How closely the model matches real entrepreneurial conditions.
- **Need for New Approach** for integrated phase-based learning + + calibrated federated learning


## Three-Dimensional Complexity Analysis

The unusability of entrepreneurial decision models stems from three interconnected dimensions of complexity:

1. **System Design Issues**: The fundamental tractability-reality tradeoff creates structural barriers to model adoption, as evidenced by the progression from strategy-only to operational-scaling EDMs.
    
2. **Individual Cognitive Barriers**: Entrepreneurs face overwhelming cognitive load attempting to infer both their own preferences and stakeholder responses, leading to ineffective causal reasoning about multi-dimensional decision spaces.
    
3. **Institutional Coordination Gaps**: Misalignment between entrepreneur pace and institutional/societal evolution creates temporal uncertainty that compounds with spatial complexity, particularly when ventures require coordination with broader ecosystem stakeholders.
    

## Toward Integrated Solutions

This thesis proposes that entrepreneurial decision models can become usable through three integrated solutions that address these complexity dimensions:

1. **Phase-based learning** to address temporal complexity through modularized approaches that adapt to different venture development stages
2. **Proactive hypothesis proposal** to address spatial complexity through probabilistic programming that navigates stakeholder interdependencies
3. **Calibrated federated learning** to address spatio-temporal complexity through entrepreneur-social planner coordination

The challenge of making entrepreneurial decision models usable isn't just academic—it directly impacts innovation capacity, resource efficiency, and entrepreneurial success rates across the economy. By developing frameworks that balance complexity and tractability while maintaining reality fit, I can bridge the theory-practice gap and empower entrepreneurs with decision tools that match the actual challenges they face.

### 🎯 Why this structure works:

- Quickly shows that as I move **right →**, reality fit increases but **tractability collapses**.
- Builds intuitive reason **why smart uncertainty minimization methods** are necessary.
- Shows **where** your methods kick in (middle-high complexity) without overwhelming readers.

The table below compares various entrepreneurial decision models, progressing from a simple single-stakeholder strategy to a highly detailed multi-stakeholder operational model. It shows how **temporal complexity** (time/horizon) and **spatial complexity** (breadth of stakeholders/variables) increase along this spectrum, leading to higher dimensionality, reduced tractability, and changes in phenomenological accuracy. At the extreme end, traditional optimization and heuristic methods become insufficient – underscoring the need for new approaches like **federated learning** (to manage temporal complexity) and **proactive proposal testing** (to manage spatial complexity).

### 2.2 The Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Need Analysis: Mathematical Mapping

In this section, we identify the root causes of entrepreneurial decision-making challenges across three levels and three dimensions, structured as a need matrix, and show how each need maps to specific elements in our mathematical formulations:

| **Level**                   | **Need 1: Perception** (📽️)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Need 2: Coordination** (🔄)                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Need 3: Sequencing** (⚡)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **2.2.2 Stakeholder Level** | Different stakeholders perceive the same venture differently, shown by stakeholder-specific uncertainty terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ and expectation constraints $\sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ | Circular dependencies among stakeholders create "waiting for each other" deadlocks, addressed by joint optimization of $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ expectations                                 | Stakeholder uncertainty reduction requires prioritization, managed by weights $\textcolor{purple}{w_j}$ in $\sum_{j} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j                                                                                                                                                |
| **2.2.3 Venture Level**     | Resource constraints on perception testing, formalized as $C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$ and $\sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$                                                             | Information spillover opportunities across stakeholders, captured in the dual through shared likelihood terms related to $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$                                            | Intractable planning problem of experiment sequencing, addressed through the decision rule $\textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$ |

Each cell in this matrix represents not just a conceptual challenge but also maps directly to specific mathematical elements in our formulations, connecting entrepreneurial needs to formal optimization structures:

1. **Perception Challenges** (📽️): These map to uncertainty terms $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ in the probabilistic formulation and entropy terms $H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a})$ in the primal-dual approach. Perception asymmetry is captured by stakeholder-specific distributions $p_j$ and expectation terms $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$.
    
2. **Coordination Challenges** (🔄): These correspond to the interdependencies between stakeholder states in $B,\textcolor{green}{S}$ and the consistency constraints on expectations $\textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a})$ across stakeholders. In the dual formulation, coordination is addressed through likelihood maximization that aligns all stakeholders' expectations.
    
3. **Sequencing Challenges** (⚡): These map to the resource constraints $C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$ and action variable $\textcolor{red}{a}$, along with the state transition function $D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{a})$. The dual decision rule provides a computationally tractable approach to this otherwise NP-complete problem by determining which experiments to run based on their information value per cost. 

Entrepreneurs struggle to understand how stakeholders perceive their ventures. Different stakeholders (investors, customers, partners) project identical startup attributes onto different perceptual dimensions, creating a fundamental information asymmetry problem.  Traditional approaches either assume perfect information or rely on intuitive reading of stakeholder signals. Our framework uses perceptual projection models to decode how observable venture attributes map to stakeholder decision spaces, enabling entrepreneurs to optimize information gathering and signal presentation. from  [[1.📽️Individual level of stakeholder perception problem]]

Entrepreneurs face circular dependencies where stakeholders make simultaneous, interdependent decisions. Investors wait for customer validation, customers require operational proof, and partners need investment signals, creating deadlock situations. Conventional methods tackle stakeholders sequentially, but this approach cannot resolve inherent circularity. Our framework enables entrepreneurs to act as central coordinators who leverage information spillovers across stakeholder networks, breaking decision deadlocks through parallel engagement strategies.  [[2.🔄Individual level of multi-stakeholder coordination problem]]


Entrepreneurs must sequence actions optimally under severe resource constraints. However, they cannot directly compute the uncertainty reduction per cost for each possible action sequence due to combinatorial explosion. Standard optimization approaches become computationally intractable as variables increase. Our bottleneck-driven framework allows entrepreneurs to make near-optimal myopic decisions by decomposing complex metrics into estimable components, focusing resources on experiments that provide maximum information value. This mapping demonstrates how our mathematical formulations capture each dimension of the entrepreneurial decision challenge. The probabilistic formulation emphasizes uncertainty minimization across stakeholders, while the primal-dual approach transforms this into maximizing stakeholder satisfaction likelihood under resource constraints. from [[3.⚡Individual level of resource optimization problem]]

### 2.3 Probabilistic Formulation Overview

This section introduces the unified probabilistic formulation that captures all dimensions of the entrepreneurial decision problem:

$$ \begin{aligned} \min_{\textcolor{red}{a} \in \textcolor{red}{A}} \quad & \textcolor{purple}{W_d}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d} + \textcolor{purple}{W_s}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s} + \textcolor{purple}{W_i}\cdot\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i} && \text{(Objective)} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & B,\textcolor{green}{S} = [\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s},,\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}] && \text{(Uncertainty-State Mapping)} \ & C,\textcolor{red}{A} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} && \text{(Resource Budget)} \ & D(\textcolor{green}{S},,\textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'} && \text{(State Transition)} \end{aligned} $$

We explain how this formulation captures the three challenges: reducing uncertainty for individual stakeholders (📽️ perception), aligning multi-stakeholder dynamics (🔄 coordination), and selecting actions under resource limits (⚡ bottleneck-breaking).

### 2.4 Primal-Dual Optimization Formulation

We also present the primal-dual optimization formulation that provides complementary insights into the entrepreneurial decision problem:

**Primal (Uncertainty Minimization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \min_{p,\textcolor{red}{a}} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a}) \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k} p_{jk} = 1, \quad \forall j \ & \sum_{k} p_{jk} f_{jk} = \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a}), \quad \forall j \ & p_{jk} \geq 0, \quad \forall j,k \ & \sum_{j} c_j \textcolor{red}{a_j} \leq \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ & \textcolor{red}{a_j} \in {0,1}, \quad \forall j \end{aligned} $$

**Dual (Likelihood Maximization):** $$ \begin{aligned} \max_{\lambda, \beta, \gamma} \quad & \sum_{j \in {d,s,i}} \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(\textcolor{red}{a_j}) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] - \gamma \textcolor{#8B0000}{R} \ \text{s.t.} \quad & \gamma \geq 0 \ & \text{where } \textcolor{red}{a_j^*} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \textcolor{purple}{w_j}[\lambda_j + \beta_j^T \textcolor{green}{\mu_j}(1) - \log Z_j(\beta_j)] > \gamma c_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned} $$

This dual formulation provides critical insights by transforming the uncertainty minimization problem into a likelihood maximization problem—revealing how entrepreneurs can maximize the probability of stakeholder satisfaction while optimizing resource allocation.
