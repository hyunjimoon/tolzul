# Entrepreneurial Decision-Making Framework

|Axis|Dimension|Associated Schools|Key Concept|Real-World Application|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Learning Approach**|**Emergent**|🗽 Austrian<br>🧠 Behaviouralist|• Hayek's "tacit knowledge"<br>• Learning through direct action<br>• Distributed information discovery|• "Lean Startup" methodology<br>• Market-based discovery<br>• Pivoting based on customer feedback|
||**Theory-Based**|📈 Neoclassical<br>⚡ Schumpeterian|• Systematic experimentation<br>• Model-driven testing<br>• Hypothesis-based learning|• A/B testing<br>• Controlled market experiments<br>• Data-driven decision making|
|**Priors**|**Shared**|📈 Neoclassical<br>💰 Keynesian|• Common knowledge<br>• Rational expectations<br>• Market equilibrium theories|• Industry consensus<br>• Standard business models<br>• Mainstream market opportunities|
||**Subjective**|🗽 Austrian<br>🧠 Behaviouralist|• Kirzner's entrepreneurial alertness<br>• Cognitive differentiation<br>• "Agreeing to disagree"|• Contrarian investments<br>• Novel market insights<br>• Disruptive business models|

This framework reveals how entrepreneurs approach uncertainty differently. Those with Austrian and Behaviouralist tendencies may rely more on personal insights and experiential learning, while those with Neoclassical and Schumpeterian perspectives might prefer systematic testing within established frameworks. The most innovative entrepreneurs (Homo Entrepreneuricus) typically combine subjective priors with theory-based learning—seeing opportunities others miss while rigorously testing their unique insights.

|Archetype|Description|Closest Cocktail|Key Schools of Thought|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Homo Entrepreneuricus**<br>(Subjective Priors + Theory-Based)|Entrepreneurs who hold unique beliefs but test them systematically through deliberate experiments.

They believe that market competition gradually reveals truth.|🔓 CAN<br>(Classical + Austrian + Neoclassical)|📜 **Classical**: Learning through market competition<br>📈 **Neoclassical**: Belief in common interpretations of information|
|**Effectuation Entrepreneur**<br>(Subjective Priors + Emergent Learning)|Entrepreneurs who hold unique personal beliefs but learn through improvisation rather than systematic testing.

- Behaviouralist (B) school of thought, with strong connections to Austrian (A) and Neoclassical (N) elements.  Austrian (A) emphasis on entrepreneurial discovery under uncertainty (referencing Knightian uncertainty), Neoclassical (N) 
baeys_ent:
- **Focus on Process ("Entrepreneuring"):** Emphasizes trainable activities, behaviors, and practices, not just innate traits.
- **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** Central challenge is navigating Knightian uncertainty and risk.
- **Experimentation & Learning:** Core activity involves forming hypotheses (priors), running experiments, gathering data, and updating beliefs (priors).
- **Adaptation & Emergence:** Strategies evolve and emerge through exploration, selection, and adaptation, rather than being fixed visions. Initial ideas are often flawed.
- **Rigor & System:** Experimentation is described as a rigorous, systematic process requiring design, execution, analysis, and evaluation, challenging the idea of chaotic entrepreneurship.
- **Resource Allocation:** Acknowledges the economics of experimentation – choosing which experiments to fund with limited resources (time, money, talent).
- **Cognitive & Social Aspects:** Entrepreneurs and stakeholders must be able to adapt beliefs (linking to behavioral aspects) and convince others.
