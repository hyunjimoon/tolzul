**Purchase Decision Function:** $P(Purchase) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Attribute_i - \theta)$

Where:

- $w_i$ is the Decision Impact weight for attribute $i$
- $\theta$ is the purchase threshold (currently 3.2)
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

**Sublime's Current Position (May 2025):**

- Cost Premium: Level 1 (Currently >50% higher than Portland)
- ESG Certification Value: Level 3 (Premium "zero-carbon" certification potential)
- Supply Chain Reliability: Level 1 (Unproven at scale)
- Regulatory Approval: Level 2 (Limited approval for non-structural applications)
- Case Studies/References: Level 2 (One Boston Wharf Road project)

|**Carbon Reduction**|<50%|50-80%|>80%|0.4|
|**Production Cost**|>2x Portland|1.3-2x Portland|‚â§1.3x Portland|0.7|

**Investment Decision Function:** $P(Invest) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Attribute_i - \theta)$

Where:

- $w_i$ is the Decision Impact weight for attribute $i$
- $\theta$ is the investment threshold (currently 2.5)
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

**Current $P(Invest)$ = 0.73**


## Interpretation and Strategy Implications

These decision matrices reveal Sublime Systems' key strategic challenges:

1. **Investors** are most likely to engage (P=0.73) due to strong climate tech interest, but are concerned about production costs and capital requirements.
    
2. **Operational Partners** show moderate engagement likelihood (P=0.68), with technical validation and standards compliance being critical barriers.
    
3. **Customers** have the lowest current engagement probability (P=0.56), primarily constrained by cost premium, supply chain reliability, and regulatory approval.
    

The optimal strategy involves:

1. **Sequential Validation**: First focus on improving technical validation and reducing production costs to strengthen operational partner relationships.
    
2. **Proactive Testing**: Simultaneously engage early-adopter customers with strong ESG priorities to build case studies while production scales.
    
3. **Dynamic Calibration**: Shift focus from technical validation to cost reduction and supply reliability as production scales, to broaden customer adoption beyond early adopters.
    

This mathematical approach identifies actionable priorities for Sublime Systems while balancing the interdependent stakeholder concerns in the conservative construction materials industry.
