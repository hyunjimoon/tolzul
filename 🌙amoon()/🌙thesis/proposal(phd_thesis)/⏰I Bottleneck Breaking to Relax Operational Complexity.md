📝1 (🤜🙋‍♀️): strategy theory is detached from reality, data driven decision making lacks structure. how to operate with both theory and data-driven? theory as hyper prior phi and data as y - i show how sequencing of operations (actions) are reasoned with 🍾 bottleneck breaking - mean of B,C,D prior matrix differs


inferring the states (5^47) is too large and we're mapping that into continuous dimension using random utility model

inequality -> equality = residual uncertianty (dynamic calibration) - D(s,a) = s' 

- instead of thinking given the resource, what's the path? 
- we ask, given the expected path, what's the needed resource ?? => make inequality to equality (distribute remaining as a reward)
action, we take the dual and solve for (capital to raise) given the chosen path (solution)
