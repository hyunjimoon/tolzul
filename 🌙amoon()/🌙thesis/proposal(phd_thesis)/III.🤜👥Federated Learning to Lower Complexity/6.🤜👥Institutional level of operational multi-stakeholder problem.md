This section builds on the tractability-reality gap defined in [[1.1😵‍💫Entrepreneurial Decision Models are Unusable by Entrepreneurs]], focusing on how institutional-level complexity emerges from uncoordinated stakeholder beliefs and fragmented learning infrastructures. Entrepreneurs face a misalignment between their internal states $\textcolor{green}{S}$ and the externally perceived uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ across stakeholders such as investors, operations partners, and policy actors. Without shared priors or calibrated expectations, early-stage ventures encounter noisy feedback loops, uneven standards of evidence, and unpredictable resource allocation.

Here, we propose expectation propagation as a coordination mechanism, leveraging matrices $B$ and $D$ to align stakeholder evaluations of a given venture's maturity. Institutions like accelerators, funds, and government agencies can collect test statistics from venture actions $\textcolor{red}{A}$ and use shared update protocols to reduce $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ through federated learning. This enables more consistent evaluation and targeted support, narrowing the tractability-reality gap through institutional memory and structured milestone calibration.
