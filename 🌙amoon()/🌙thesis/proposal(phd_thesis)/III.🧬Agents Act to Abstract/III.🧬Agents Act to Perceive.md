Agents Sample for Society to Optimize

| **3. Problem Definition** | Even with a great model and unified metrics in place, entrepreneurs face a dynamic question: **What to do next, and thereafter?** The problem of sequencing actions under uncertainty is crucial – take the wrong step first and a startup can burn through its budget on low-impact learnings. Currently, many founders rely on intuition or linear plans (e.g. “build product then see if customers come”) which can leave the riskiest assumptions untested until it’s too late. The key insight framing this problem is the notion of a **“bottleneck” uncertainty – usually one pivotal unknown that bottlenecks progress**. Without a strategy to identify and attack that bottleneck, entrepreneurs may **waste time on peripheral tasks**. Thus, the challenge here is designing a method to continually choose the **optimal next experiment** in a sequence, so that each step maximizes venture progress (for the society of stakeholders) before resources run out. Articulating this problem highlights a final gap: entrepreneurs need a **stopwatch and a compass** – a way to know which direction to go first and when they’ve learned enough to move on. This sets the stage for a solution that treats action selection as a **repeatable, optimized cycle** rather than a one-off decision. |  
| **3.1 💭 Theorize Solution** | We theorize entrepreneurial action selection as an **iterative decision policy**: at any given moment, pick the action that offers the **highest information gain per cost** (using the unified score from Section II), then update your knowledge and repeat. In essence, each action is viewed as a **sample from the real world** that the agent (entrepreneur) takes to improve the venture’s outlook for the whole stakeholder set. The key insight of this theory is the greedy-yet-principled strategy of always attacking the current **bottleneck uncertainty** – the area where an incremental experiment would most increase overall success probability. By formalizing this, we hypothesize that an entrepreneur can transform the chaotic trial-and-error process into a **directed exploration**: like climbing a hill in fog by always moving in the direction that steepens your ascent (here, steepest ascent = greatest uncertainty reduction). For entrepreneurs, this means their decision-making shifts from “What do I feel like doing next?” to “What does the data suggest will move the needle most?”. It offers a clear **guiding principle**: prioritize actions by their **venture-wide impact**. |  
| **3.2 📐 Produce Solution** | We produce this solution in the form of the **STRAP decision algorithm**, which operationalizes the perception–action cycle. Concretely, the algorithm works in iterative loops: (a) Calculate the unified score (from II.2) for all pending candidate actions (e.g. run a pilot test, seek regulatory feedback, initiate a partnership, etc.). (b) Select the action with the **highest score** – this is the recommended “next move” which maximizes information gained per dollar and balances stakeholder needs. (c) Execute that experiment and **update the perceptual model** with the new data (stakeholder probabilities get refined, uncertainty measures recomputed). (d) Repeat the scoring with the updated model to choose the subsequent action. This production turns theory into a step-by-step **decision engine**. The key insight is that by continually recalculating the optimal next step, the process adapts to surprises and new information – it’s **dynamic optimization** in practice, not a fixed plan. The entrepreneurial contribution is essentially a **smart playbook**: a living sequence of actions that recalibrates after each result, giving founders a responsive strategy (much like an autopilot adjusting course) rather than a rigid roadmap. |  
| **3.3 💸 Evaluate Solution** | We evaluate the effectiveness of this bottleneck-driven sequencing through comparative analysis and case application. In the case study (e.g. a climate-tech startup’s go-to-market process), following the STRAP-guided sequence achieved notable outcomes: **every stakeholder’s critical need was met in the course of the sequence**, and overall uncertainty about the venture’s success dropped significantly (an outcome of systematically learning the unknowns). For instance, the algorithm suggested starting with a regulatory certification experiment, which, while not the intuitive first step for a tech-focused founder, yielded the largest reduction in risk (it boosted the regulator’s approval probability by a big margin and uncovered hidden technical requirements early). Subsequent steps, like targeted customer pilots, were chosen by their impact on both learning and stakeholder confidence. The STRAP sequence outperformed a traditional approach (which might have, say, built product features first) – **the traditional path left some stakeholders unconvinced and key questions unanswered even after spending similar resources**. The key insight from this evaluation is that **targeting the right uncertainty at the right time dramatically accelerates and de-risks the venture**: the startup reached validation milestones with fewer “pivots” and no major surprises, whereas the baseline path struggled. For entrepreneurs, this is strong evidence that a data-driven experimental sequence isn’t just academically elegant – it **delivers tangible improvements** in venture outcomes (more knowledge gained, higher stakeholder buy-in, and ultimately a greater chance of success). This evaluation also provided new learning metrics: for example, we could quantify how much each action reduced entropy and watch stakeholder “satisfaction scores” rise in real-time, giving a much richer feedback than vanity metrics like user counts. |  
| **3.4 📜 Related Work** | This sequential action approach ties into **lean startup methodologies**, **scientific experimentation**, and algorithmic decision-making research. Practically, it echoes the build–measure–learn cycle championed in startup literature, but we formalize that intuition with a **Bayesian, quantitative backbone**. In academic terms, our work relates to **sequential decision problems** such as multi-armed bandits and **optimal stopping** theories – like those, we seek to maximize information or reward over a series of trials. However, classic bandit algorithms seldom incorporate multiple stakeholder constraints; our contribution was to integrate those real-world complexities. We also draw inspiration from **real options analysis** (treating each experiment as an investment in information) and adapt concepts from **operations research** (e.g. prioritization under uncertainty) to the entrepreneurial context. By connecting to these threads, we show how STRAP’s action sequencing isn’t reinventing the wheel but rather **bridging proven concepts into entrepreneurship**. The vivid difference is in application: where prior work offered high-level guidance (“pivot quickly”, “stay agile”), our framework gives a **granular, mathematically-grounded game plan**. In sum, this related work discussion situates STRAP’s sequential strategy as a novel synthesis – one that translates the wisdom of agile experimentation and the rigor of decision science into a **practical playbook for founders**.

In this section, we elevate the focus to the **institutional level**, addressing complexities that arise when individual ventures interact with social planners (such as government agencies, accelerators, or industry consortia). Often, individual entrepreneurs and these institutional stakeholders operate with different mental models or expectations of how a venture’s _state_ will evolve with certain actions. For instance, a founder might be optimistic about how quickly a product can scale (state transition), whereas regulators or grant committees (the social planners) have more conservative expectations based on historical data. These **misaligned expectations** about state transitions impede effective ecosystem learning — good ideas may be stalled by bureaucratic skepticism, or conversely, policymakers may push initiatives that startups aren’t prepared to execute, leading to wasted resources.

We propose an **expectation propagation** framework to align these differing belief systems. In essence, we want to ensure that all parties share as much of a common, evidence-based expectation as possible regarding the venture’s progress and outcomes. We model each stakeholder’s expectation as a probabilistic belief about state transitions $D$. An individual venture has its **internal model** $\hat{D}_s$ of what action $a_s$ will do to its state $s$ (learned from its own data and experience). Meanwhile, an institutional stakeholder (e.g., a government grant program) has an **external model** or expectation $\hat{D}_e$ of what that action would do in the context of the wider ecosystem (based on data from many ventures, industry reports, etc.). When $\hat{D}_s$ and $\hat{D}_e$ differ significantly, we have expectation misalignment.

Our approach frames this as a **primal-dual optimization** problem over the ecosystem’s knowledge space. The _primal_ objective is to **minimize the residual uncertainty** in these state transition expectations across all actors, weighted by their importance $\textcolor{violet}{W}$. For example, we might weigh a regulator’s uncertainty heavily if regulatory approval is critical for the venture’s success. This can be expressed as minimizing a resource-weighted uncertainty measure like $\frac{\text{Residual } \textcolor{violet}{W}!\textcolor{#3399FF}{B}!\textcolor{green}{S'_e}}{\textcolor{red}{C(A'_e)}}$ (where $\textcolor{#3399FF}{B}$ here might represent the uncertainty in belief alignment and $\textcolor{red}{C(A'_e)}$ the cost of engaging in alignment actions with set $A'_e$ of ecosystem-level actions). The _dual_ interpretation is **maximizing the likelihood of a collectively successful outcome** — essentially, the probability that, given our interventions, all parties end up with accurate and aligned expectations (thus making decisions that complement each other). In practical terms, if the primal problem says “reduce uncertainty in the government’s belief about battery technology scalability,” the dual says “increase the chance that the government correctly predicts how the startup’s battery scales, so its funding decisions are spot-on.”

To achieve expectation alignment, we institute a **two-step calibration process** between each venture and the ecosystem:

1. **Venture Self-Calibration:** The startup updates its internal model using recent data: $s'_s = \hat{D}_s(a_s, s_s)$. This yields the startup’s predicted next state $s'_s$ after action $a_s$. If the startup has any internal uncertainty, it can update $\hat{D}_s$ (e.g., refine its estimates or incorporate expert advice).
    
2. **Ecosystem Model Update:** The institutional stakeholder’s model is updated in a Bayesian sense: $\tilde{D}_e \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{D}_e, \sigma^2)$, meaning the external model is treated as having uncertainty (variance $\sigma^2$) around its prediction. New evidence from the startup (like a pilot result) is used to adjust $\hat{D}_e$. Think of $\tilde{D}_e$ as the regulator’s revised view of the transition dynamics after seeing the startup’s data, represented as a distribution around their prior expectation.
    
3. **Action Impact Synchronization:** Now, the actual action $a_e$ (which could be the startup’s action or an ecosystem action like a policy change) is applied: $D_a(a_e, s_e) = s'_e$. This is the real outcome in the ecosystem (e.g., the startup’s technology actually achieves a certain performance, or a policy actually gets implemented, moving the ecosystem state).
    
4. **Expectation Reconciliation:** We enforce $\mathbb{E}[s'_e] = s'_s$, meaning the expected ecosystem state change aligns with what the startup predicted for itself. Any deviation here indicates misalignment that needs further calibration.
    

These steps embody a **federated learning** concept: the startup and the institution are essentially performing updates and sharing information to converge on a common predictive model. It’s bi-directional — not only does the startup learn from the institution’s data, but the institution learns from the startup’s on-the-ground reality. Over time, through repeated cycles, both parties refine their $D$ matrices (internal and external) so that they begin to agree. The venture’s belief about what it can achieve becomes more realistic (if it was over-optimistic, it adjusts down, or if the institution was pessimistic, it adjusts up as evidence accumulates), and the institution’s belief becomes more tailored to the venture’s context rather than generic historical data.

On the **production** side, we implement this via a shared platform or protocol for expectation exchange. This could involve periodic reporting and updates: the venture reports progress metrics, the institutional stakeholders (e.g., a grant officer or a policy analyst) update their forecasts and perhaps send back guidance or adjust requirements. We aggregate uncertainty patterns across multiple ventures, since institutions often deal with portfolios. For example, a government energy department might be trying to learn the true trajectory of battery tech evolution by funding 10 different battery startups. Through expectation propagation, each startup’s data updates the department’s overall model (updating shared priors), and in return the department might provide all startups with updated benchmarks or goals that reflect the latest collective learning (e.g., raising safety standards once it’s clear from others that higher performance is achievable).

We ensure **shared priors** are continuously updated: instead of a one-time alignment, expectation propagation is ongoing. This creates a living **knowledge repository** that benefits everyone. A startup essentially gets the wisdom of the broader community (via the updated expectations fed back by institutions), and institutions get ground truth data (via startup experiments) to refine policy or investment strategies.

Finally, we **evaluate** the expectation propagation approach in scenarios like grantmaking and regulatory sandboxes. We simulate an ecosystem with multiple startups and a central policy body. In one scenario without expectation propagation, each startup and the policy body act on their own beliefs – this often leads to mismatches like startups overestimating progress and running into regulatory hurdles, or policy incentives not being utilized effectively by startups. In the expectation propagation scenario, we see emergent behavior of **coordination**: policies adapt more quickly to what startups achieve, and startups pivot or focus on areas that policymakers signal as high priority or likely to get support. Quantitatively, we measure improvements such as reduced time lag between a breakthrough in one startup and related adjustments in industry regulations, or higher success rate of startups receiving grants (since the grants and the startups’ capabilities are better matched by aligned expectations).

Through continuous calibration, a **feedback loop** is established. Each iteration of updating expectations slightly lowers the misalignment. Over multiple cycles, the system’s actors (both ventures and planners) converge toward a shared understanding of what the venture can do and what support it needs. This greatly **lowers complexity at the operational multi-stakeholder level** because much of the friction came from miscommunication and divergent expectations. With expectation propagation, that friction is reduced: everyone is “on the same page” sooner. The outcome is not just smoother individual decisions (founders make moves knowing regulators are likely to approve, investors fund knowing founders’ timelines are realistic) but also better **system-wide resource allocation**. For example, public R&D funds flow into areas where they empirically make a difference, and startups adjust their strategies to align with those well-informed funding signals. Overall, this federated primal-dual learning approach boosts the innovation ecosystem’s efficiency: more startups succeed in meeting external requirements, and institutions more effectively facilitate – rather than inadvertently hinder – startup progress. The chapter demonstrates that aligning expectations is a powerful lever to reduce multi-stakeholder operational complexity, completing our unified framework by showing the long-term, large-scale payoff of continual uncertainty reduction (primal) and increased likelihood of collective success (dual) in the startup ecosystem.

This section focuses on expectation propagation as a federated strategy for aligning multi-stakeholder belief systems at the institutional level. By modeling each stakeholder's residual uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_d}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}, \textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$ and assigning weights $\textcolor{violet}{W}$, we construct a shared evaluative framework to calibrate decision quality across ventures. Expectation propagation is grounded in the idea that agents (e.g., government, VCs, supply chain partners) have correlated yet misaligned beliefs about startup maturity, and that coordination can be improved by systematically updating shared priors. This part defines mechanisms for learning the matrices $B$ and $D$ from stakeholder feedback and survey data, enabling adaptive policy recommendations and personalized founder guidance at scale.
