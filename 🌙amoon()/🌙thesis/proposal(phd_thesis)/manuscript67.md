|**Mining Test Quantities with Exchangeability: Bayesian Reversibility**|Introduces altructures ensuring reversible learning from sequential experiments, transforming path-dependent complexity into cumulative federated knowledge that reduces spatio-temporal uncertainty .|Clarifies federated learning strategies via reversible test quantity metrics, systematically shaping spatio-temporal state transitions ($D(S,A)=S'$) into a coordinated federated learning process .|
|**Complexity Analysis of Entrepreneurial Decision-Making (NP-Hardness Proof)**|Provides foundational complexity theory justifying the necessity for federated approximation strategies by demonstrating intrinsic computational complexity of comprehensive spatio-temporal optimization, motivating federated learning as necessary due to NP-hardness .|Establishes theoretical justification for federated learning approaches due to computational complexity, defining why exact spatio-temporal uncertainty optimization ($U_d, U_s, U_i$) is intractable without federated strategies .|
|**Calibrated Federated Learning via Entrepreneur–Social Planner Coordination**|Extends federated learning to ecosystem-level coordination, defining collaborative milestone-driven benchmarks that federate spatio-temporal insights from individual ventures and social planners, systematically reducing ecosystem-wide complexity​oaicite:4.|Clarifies theoretical structures for collaborative, federated optimization across ventures, explicitly aligning multi-venture state transitions ($D(S,A)=S'$) into unified spatio-temporal uncertainty reduction strategies ($U_d, U_s, U_i$)​oaicite:5.|
