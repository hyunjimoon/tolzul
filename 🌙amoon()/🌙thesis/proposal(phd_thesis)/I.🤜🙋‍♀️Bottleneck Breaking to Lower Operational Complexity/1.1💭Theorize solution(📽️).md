Model perception as information projection; use primal-dual to optimize data collection: minimize $\sum_j \textcolor{purple}{w_j} H(p_j|\textcolor{red}{a})$


---

Entrepreneurs face operational decision-making under extreme uncertainty, without a clear structure for sequencing actions. We theorize this as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to minimize stakeholder uncertainty $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$ given action costs $C$ and limited resources $\textcolor{#8B0000}{R}$. However, inferring the full venture state space $\textcolor{green}{S}$ (e.g., $5^{47}$ configurations) is computationally infeasible. To resolve this, we treat strategy as a hyperprior and actions as Bayesian updates, asking not ‚Äúwhat can I do given my resources,‚Äù but rather, ‚Äúwhat resources do I need to execute the optimal path.‚Äù This dual framing reverses inequality constraints into dynamic equalities that define reward distributions and resource requirements. Bottleneck breaking emerges as a middle-ground theory for actionable experimentation under structured tractability.

## ideas
using [[hier_mix.pdf]],
#### **Strategy as a hyperprior ($\textcolor{green}{\phi}$)**

Founders begin with a structured belief about what type of actions are likely to work across contexts‚Äîthis is modeled as the **population-level hyperparameter** $\textcolor{green}{\phi}$ in a hierarchical Bayes model. Just as $\textcolor{green}{\phi}$ governs the distribution of traveler sensitivities ($\theta_n$) in the Swissmetro example, in entrepreneurship $\textcolor{green}{\phi}$ governs how founders assign prior likelihood to operational sequences like ‚Äúcollaborate first‚Äù vs. ‚Äúsegment first.‚Äù These priors may be informed by accelerators, mentors, or domain archetypes and encode strategy ‚Äústyle‚Äù at a meta level before any data ($y_n$) is observed. In this sense, the founder‚Äôs strategy reflects beliefs not about one venture, but about the distribution of decision pathways across similar ventures.

#### **Actions as Bayesian updates ($\textcolor{red}{a_t}$)**

Each entrepreneurial action $\textcolor{red}{a_t}$‚Äîe.g., applying to a testing facility or pitching to investors‚Äîyields observable outcomes analogous to $y_n$ in hierarchical Bayes models. These outcomes (e.g., stakeholder reactions, state transitions $S \rightarrow S'$) update the posterior over the founder‚Äôs latent decision parameters ($\theta$), narrowing uncertainty $U$ over time. Just as in the Swissmetro model we integrate over $f(\theta_n \mid \textcolor{green}{\phi})$ to get posterior likelihoods, here each action feeds into a posterior update conditioned on both prior strategic style ($\textcolor{green}{\phi}$) and current experimental evidence. This allows entrepreneurs to personalize their model based on partial feedback, learning over time what works best in their state-space.

Guided explicitly by gradients: $\frac{\nabla_{\textcolor{red}{A}}\textcolor{#3399FF}{U}(\textcolor{green}{S},\textcolor{red}{A})}{\textcolor{#FF69B4}{C}(\textcolor{red}{A})}$, maximizing utility per unit cost explicitly across stakeholders.

# Optimization Formulation Table

|Variable|Definition|Example with Sublime Systems (Cement Company)|
|---|---|---|
|W (Weight Vector)|Importance weights assigned to each stakeholder (customer, operations partner, investor)|For Sublime Systems: W_customer might be higher than typical since decarbonizing cement is a priority for construction companies due to environmental regulations|
|U (Uncertainty Vector)|Residual uncertainty about whether each stakeholder will accept the venture's value proposition|For Sublime Systems: Uncertainty about whether testing facilities will approve their low-carbon cement, whether construction companies will adopt it, and whether investors will fund it|
|S (State Vector)|Binary representation of stakeholder acceptance (1) or non-acceptance (0) for customer, operations partner, and investor|Initial state might be (0,0,0) with the goal to reach (1,1,1) where all stakeholders accept|
|A (Action Vector)|Entrepreneur's decisions on whether to segment (marketing), collaborate (operations), or capitalize (fundraising)|For Sublime Systems: Deciding to focus first on collaborating with cement testing facilities|
|B (State to Uncertainty)|Matrix mapping the current state to uncertainty levels for each stakeholder|For cement company: Lower uncertainty for customers (building constructors) who are under pressure to reduce carbon footprint|
|C (Action to Cost)|Matrix mapping actions to resource requirements or costs|For Sublime Systems: Collaborating with testing facilities might have lower cost if they have connections|
|D (State Transition)|Matrix showing how actions affect state transitions|For materials company: Getting approval from testing facility (collaboration) might have spillover effect, improving chances with customers by 20%|
|R (Resources)|Available resources for the venture to use in actions|Sublime Systems' available capital, time, and connections to pursue actions|

## Understanding the Database to Matrix Mapping

Based on the transcript discussions and the database layout provided, I can now propose how the existing database structure would map to the optimization variables (B, C, D matrices) in the Bayesian entrepreneurship model.

### Mapping from Database to B Matrix (State to Uncertainty)

The B matrix represents how a venture's state impacts uncertainty across stakeholders. From the database:

- **CustomerValueProposition** table: Contains information about industry, venture type, and value proposition that would affect customer uncertainty
- **FounderBackground** table: Experience and background that would affect investor uncertainty
- **StartupJourney** table: Success indicators that would affect all stakeholder uncertainties

### Mapping from Database to C Matrix (Action to Cost)

The C matrix represents the cost of various actions (segment, collaborate, capitalize). From the database:

- **Funding** table: Contains information on resources available (total_amount_raised, latest_valuation)
- **Marketing** table: Represents some segmentation costs through marketing channels
- **StartupJourney**: number_of_pivots can indicate previous action costs

### Mapping from Database to D Matrix (State Transition)

The D matrix represents how actions change the venture's state. This is the most complex and might require additional data not currently in the database:

- **StartupJourney**: within_3_years_success and post_three_years_success could help derive historical transition probabilities
- **Funding**: funding rounds progression could show state transitions following capitalization actions
