- Behaviouralist (B) school of thought, with strong connections to Austrian (A) and Neoclassical (N) elements.  Austrian (A) emphasis on entrepreneurial discovery under uncertainty (referencing Knightian uncertainty), Neoclassical (N) 
baeys_ent:
- **Focus on Process ("Entrepreneuring"):** Emphasizes trainable activities, behaviors, and practices, not just innate traits.
- **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** Central challenge is navigating Knightian uncertainty and risk.
- **Experimentation & Learning:** Core activity involves forming hypotheses (priors), running experiments, gathering data, and updating beliefs (priors).
- **Adaptation & Emergence:** Strategies evolve and emerge through exploration, selection, and adaptation, rather than being fixed visions. Initial ideas are often flawed.
- **Rigor & System:** Experimentation is described as a rigorous, systematic process requiring design, execution, analysis, and evaluation, challenging the idea of chaotic entrepreneurship.
- **Resource Allocation:** Acknowledges the economics of experimentation – choosing which experiments to fund with limited resources (time, money, talent).
- **Cognitive & Social Aspects:** Entrepreneurs and stakeholders must be able to adapt beliefs (linking to behavioral aspects) and convince others.
