| **Adaptive Entrepreneurship: A Preliminary Framework Using Exaptation and Exchangeability** | Uses exaptation and cross-context hypothesis testing to proactively explore and validate stakeholder opportunities, strategically reducing uncertainty across markets and stakeholders .                        | Formulates stakeholder uncertainty reduction via exchangeable decises, systematically structuring state-action hypotheses for proactive testing ($U_d$) .                                                     |
| **Zero to One and Done**                                                                    | Systematically classifies and tests uncertainties across contexts (epistemic and aleatoric) to proactively generalize validated insightsple stakeholder opportunities, thus strategically reducing complexity . | Clarifies how proactive hypothesis testing accelerates uncertainty reduction through validation of exchangeability across contexts, refining stakeholder-focused state-action-utility relationships ($U_d$) . |
| **Equity Proposal as Action: Optimal Term Sheets via Conversational Inference**             | Implements iterative hypothesis-probing proposals during negotiations, reducing stakeholder complexity through structured conversational inference about investor intentions and founder-investor alignments .  | Defines proactive hypothesis-driven negotiation strategies as structured sequences of proposals, explicitly mapping stakeholder state-action-utility interactions ($U_i$) .                                   |
