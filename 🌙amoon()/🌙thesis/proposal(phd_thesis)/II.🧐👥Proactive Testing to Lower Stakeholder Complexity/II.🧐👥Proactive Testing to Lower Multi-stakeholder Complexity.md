This section introduces proactive hypothesis testing as a mechanism to navigate multi-stakeholder complexity, where actions affect stakeholders whose decisions are interdependent and uncertain. Using the dynamic $D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}$ transition model, we show how strategic experimentation can trigger cross-stakeholder spillover — for example, gaining customer trust after validation by a testing facility. The matrix $B$ captures each stakeholder’s interpretation of the current state $\textcolor{green}{S}$, helping to anticipate accept/reject responses. This part advocates for simultaneous testing across stakeholders to break feedback loops and minimize negotiation cycles, thereby accelerating coordinated commitment toward scaling.
