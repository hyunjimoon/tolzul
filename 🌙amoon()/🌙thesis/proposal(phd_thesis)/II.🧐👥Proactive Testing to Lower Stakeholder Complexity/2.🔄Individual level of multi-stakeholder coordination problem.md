Multiple stakeholders make simultaneous interdependent decisions with circular dependencies

---

Multiple stakeholders create circular dependencies in decision-making, where each party’s commitment is contingent on others (e.g., investors need customer validation; customers need operational approval; operators need investment).


This section analyzes the individual entrepreneur's challenge in navigating multi-stakeholder complexity, as introduced in [[0.1💭Need Analysis]]. Each stakeholder (e.g., investor, customer, operations partner) holds a private uncertainty model $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_j}$ that depends on their interpretation of the current state $\textcolor{green}{S}$ and observed signals. However, these interpretations are often opaque, conditional, and interdependent. As a result, entrepreneurs face ambiguity not just about which stakeholder to convince first, but also about how convincing one may spill over to others.

To manage this, we model stakeholder evaluation as $B\textcolor{green}{S} = \textcolor{#3399FF}{U}$, and simulate test actions $\textcolor{red}{A}$ to elicit reactions from each stakeholder. The transition matrix $D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'}$ captures potential spillover effects. Proactive testing is proposed as a solution: entrepreneurs concurrently present aligned offers to all stakeholders to minimize back-and-forth and trigger coordinated commitment. This allows for structured, cost-efficient exploration of interdependent stakeholder preferences.
