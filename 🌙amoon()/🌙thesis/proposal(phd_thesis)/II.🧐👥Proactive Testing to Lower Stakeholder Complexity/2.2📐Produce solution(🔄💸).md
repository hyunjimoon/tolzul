### Figure C.7.1: Marginal Benefit vs. Marginal Cost Determining Optimal Sample Size

This figure illustrates the balance between the declining marginal benefit (ŒîEU curve) and the fixed marginal cost (cy) that determines the optimal sample size n*. The graph shows:

- A decreasing curve representing the marginal information gain from each additional sample
- A horizontal line representing the fixed cost per sample
- The intersection point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost, marking the optimal sample size n*
- Beyond this point, the marginal benefit becomes less than the marginal cost, showing diminishing returns

### Figure C.7.2: Posteri2025-05-09or Uncertainty Reduction as a Function of Sample Size

This figure shows how posterior uncertainty (entropy) diminishes as sample size increases, with different curves for different prior confidence levels:

- The blue curve represents low prior confidence (low Œ±), showing a steeper initial decline in
### Figure C.7.2: Posterior Uncertainty Reduction as a Function of Sample Size (continued)

This figure shows how posterior uncertainty (entropy) diminishes as sample size increases, with different curves for different prior confidence levels:

- The blue curve represents low prior confidence (low Œ±), showing a steeper initial decline in uncertainty
- The orange curve represents high prior confidence (high Œ±), showing a flatter trajectory
- The figure demonstrates why more samples are needed when initial confidence is low
- Both curves eventually converge to a similar uncertainty level, but require different sample sizes to reach an acceptable uncertainty threshold
- The optimal sample sizes (n_‚ÇÅ and n_‚ÇÇ) are marked at the points where each curve crosses the acceptable uncertainty threshold

### Figure C.7.3: Marginal Benefit Curves for Different Stakeholders

This figure illustrates how different stakeholders have different marginal benefit curves and cost thresholds, resulting in different optimal sample sizes:

- Three stakeholders are represented: a regulator (risk-averse), an entrepreneur (growth-focused), and an investor (balanced)
- The regulator's curve starts higher (high aversion to Type I errors/false positives) but has a low marginal cost threshold, resulting in a larger optimal sample size
- The entrepreneur's curve is moderate but has a high cost threshold (high opportunity cost), leading to a smaller optimal sample size
- The investor has a balanced approach with a moderate cost threshold, resulting in a medium sample size
- The intersection points of each marginal benefit curve with its corresponding cost threshold determine the stakeholder-specific optimal sample sizes
- Annotations highlight how different stakeholders value information differently based on their error trade-off preferences

These figures effectively illustrate the key concepts from Appendix C.7, showing how optimal sample size is determined by balancing marginal benefits against costs, how posterior uncertainty reduction depends on prior confidence, and how different stakeholders with different risk preferences require different levels of evidence.

## Interpretation and Strategy Implications

These decision matrices reveal Sublime Systems' key strategic challenges:

1. **Investors** are most likely to engage (P=0.73) due to strong climate tech interest, but are concerned about production costs and capital requirements.
    
2. **Operational Partners** show moderate engagement likelihood (P=0.68), with technical validation and standards compliance being critical barriers.
    
3. **Customers** have the lowest current engagement probability (P=0.56), primarily constrained by cost premium, supply chain reliability, and regulatory approval.
    

The optimal strategy involves:

1. **Sequential Validation**: First focus on improving technical validation and reducing production costs to strengthen operational partner relationships.
    
2. **Proactive Testing**: Simultaneously engage early-adopter customers with strong ESG priorities to build case studies while production scales.
    
3. **Dynamic Calibration**: Shift focus from technical validation to cost reduction and supply reliability as production scales, to broaden customer adoption beyond early adopters.
    

This mathematical approach identifies actionable priorities for Sublime Systems while balancing the interdependent stakeholder concerns in the conservative construction materials industry.
