[Dynamic Portfolio Selection of NPD Programs Using Marginal Returns](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.10.1227.275) by C.Loch, S.Kavadias

abstract
ðŸŸªSelecting program portfolios within a budget constraint is an important challenge in the management of new product development (NPD). 
ðŸŸ©Optimal portfolios are difficult to define because of the combinatorial complexity of project combinations. 
ðŸŸ¦However, at the aggregate level of the strategic allocation of resources across product lines, investment in a program is not an all-or-nothing decision, but can beÂ _adjusted_, resulting in a higher or lower program benefit (e.g., higher or lower quality). In some cases, resources can be adjusted even for individual projects.

ðŸŸ§With this insight, one can useÂ _marginal analysis_Â to optimally allocate the scarce budget. This article develops a dynamic model of resource allocation, taking into account multiple interacting factors, such as independent or correlated, uncertain market payoffs that change over time, increasing or decreasing returns from the NPD investment, carry-over of the investment benefit over multiple periods, and interactions across market segments. 

ðŸŸ¥We characterize optimal policies in closed form and derive qualitative decision rules for managers.
