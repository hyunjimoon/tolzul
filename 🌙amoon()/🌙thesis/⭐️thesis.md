four step logic from [preparing vikash's class proposal cld](https://claude.ai/chat/c1adb345-6443-413d-8ae2-60248e149703)

1. state of the art of entrepreneurship decision making does not have a formal way to include operational variables and does not have a way to simultaneously consider multiple stakeholders in a resource-rational manner 
2. my contribution to entrepreneurship decision making is: 
		1. to include certain entrepreneur operational variables explicitly into the entrepreneurship decision process 
		2. to explicitly include multiple stakeholders decision process 
3. In the absence of thinking about operational variables, an entrepreneur is likely to do 🚨, but when including the considerations of operational variables, the entrepreneur is has a much more subtle, sophisticated appreciation of the decision that must be made, and therefore they'll do not 🚨. 
4. secret sauce of 3 is, probabilistic program which is syntactically restricted and probabilistic while semantically rich. using this, program for founder that develops using three tools (culturate, collaborate, capitalize) interact with synthetic population's utility and resource of mobility innovation ecosystem using two tools (evaluate, segment) to aid entrepreneurs make meaningful choices by lowering its complexity.

| **Spatial Complexity**  | Experience decision paralysis                 | Multiple stakeholder needs without structured evaluation method                                         | Non-linear interaction effects δ_ij·x_i·x_j create evaluation challenges      |
| **Spatial Complexity**  | Follow industry norms or biases               | Defaulting to conventions rather than systematic evaluation of operational contexts                     | Simplified heuristics used instead of properly modeling U(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) |
Entrepreneurial decision-making faces dual complexity challenges that render traditional optimization approaches computationally intractable. The state of the art in entrepreneurship research lacks formal methods to incorporate operational variables and simultaneously consider multiple stakeholders in a resource-rational manner. This paper introduces a novel framework addressing both temporal complexity (opportunity-dependent utility functions evolving stochastically over time) and spatial complexity (non-additive utility structures from interdependent stakeholder decisions). Without structured approaches to these complexities, entrepreneurs face overwhelming cognitive demands, miss critical bottlenecks, experience decision paralysis across stakeholder needs, and default to industry norms rather than context-appropriate strategies. We demonstrate that probabilistic programming—specifically, syntactically restricted but semantically rich models—can transform this NP-complete decision space into manageable heuristics. Our approach explicitly integrates operational variables (culturate, collaborate, capitalize) with multi-stakeholder considerations (evaluate, segment) to create a generative program that supports entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty. Using Tesla's electric vehicle development as a case study, we show how this probabilistic framework identifies bottleneck-breaking operations that lower temporal complexity while maintaining strategic-operational consistency to address spatial complexity. This research contributes to entrepreneurship theory by formalizing the relationship between resource-rational decision-making and operational variables, while providing practitioners with practical tools for navigating complex entrepreneurial landscapes, particularly in rapidly evolving domains like mobility innovation.

| Abstract     | What is the motivation, objectives, methods, and key results of your research?                                                                                             | The research addresses the need for a systematic, scalable method of entrepreneurial experimentation, motivated by inconsistencies and inefficiencies in traditional trial-and-error approaches within mobility startups. The primary objective is developing a Bayesian-style parallel experimentation framework, using probabilistic program synthesis and cognitive model synthesis techniques. Methods involve segmentation, societal evaluation, and iterative decision-making cycles, employing computational cognitive models and probabilistic inference. Key results indicate that startups using this structured framework significantly improve their adaptability, decision quality, and societal alignment, with demonstrably reduced strategic uncertainty and enhanced resource allocation efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Afeyan & Pisano (2024); Stern et al.

| Introduction | Why is this research important and how does it connect to broader societal problems? What existing literature relates to your work, and what gaps does your research fill? | Entrepreneurial experimentation significantly impacts society through economic growth and innovation, especially within the mobility sector (e.g., electric vehicles, micro-mobility). Current trial-and-error methods are inefficient, creating unnecessary financial and operational risks. This research addresses these issues by proposing a structured Bayesian parallel experimentation framework, allowing startups to systematically explore strategic alternatives with reduced risks. Existing literature on Bayesian entrepreneurship (Afeyan & Pisano, 2024), transportation systems analysis (Ben-Akiva, 2024), cognitive modeling (Mansinghka, 2024), and operational frameworks (Fine, 2024) provide foundational insights, but a comprehensive method integrating these into entrepreneurial decision-making processes remains absent. This research fills that gap by synthesizing these perspectives into a practical, scalable decision-making model. Short-term goals include developing and testing the Bayesian framework in simulated mobility startup scenarios, while long-term goals involve widespread practical deployment in real-world entrepreneurship contexts to foster sustainable innovation and robust economic growth. | Afeyan & Pisano (2024); Ben-Akiva (2024); Fine (2024); Mansinghka (2024); Stern et al.

| Methods      | How did you approach your research, and how do you address uncertainty?                                                                                                    | The approach employs iterative Bayesian methods through probabilistic program synthesis combined with computational cognitive modeling. It begins with segmenting market contexts and societal values, followed by synthesizing societal utility functions based on policy incentives and societal preferences. The decision-making strategy employs probabilistic program synthesis to create scenario-specific action plans, continuously updated via Bayesian inference as experimental outcomes emerge. Uncertainty is explicitly managed through Bayesian updating, quantifying uncertainties and systematically reducing them with data-driven feedback loops. Robustness of the probabilistic approach was validated through sensitivity analyses and simulation-based calibration checks, ensuring the model's predictions remain valid under varying levels of informational uncertainty and scenario complexities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Ben-Akiva (2024); Mansinghka (2024); Angie AI Cofounder (2024); CogSci Model Synthesis (2025); Stern et al.

| Results      | What specific outcomes were observed and how was uncertainty quantified and addressed?                                                                                     | Results show significant improvements in decision clarity, resource allocation, and strategic alignment between startups and societal goals. Specifically, scenarios demonstrated that startups using Bayesian parallel experimentation frameworks achieved higher expected utility (market traction, profitability, societal impact) compared to traditional single-path experimentation. Uncertainty quantification, achieved through Bayesian posterior distributions, indicated progressive reduction in critical decision parameters (e.g., market adoption rates, resource availability) throughout experimentation cycles. Uncertainty handling involved repeated scenario testing and sensitivity analyses, ensuring model robustness and practical reliability. Quantitative metrics showed consistent improvement in predictive accuracy and decision effectiveness, directly correlated with iterative Bayesian updates driven by real-world feedback data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Angie AI Cofounder (2024); CogSci Model Synthesis (2025); Afeyan & Pisano (2024); Mansinghka (2024).                                                                         |
| Discussion   | How do your results compare with other studies, and how have you addressed the long-term applications mentioned in your introduction?                                      | Comparative analysis shows this Bayesian framework notably outperforms conventional entrepreneurial decision frameworks (Afeyan & Pisano, 2024; Stern et al., 2023), particularly regarding adaptability and robustness under uncertainty. Unlike traditional models which often neglect explicit uncertainty quantification or rely on ad-hoc experimentation methods, this structured Bayesian approach demonstrates clear empirical advantages, especially in systematically reducing decision uncertainty over multiple experimentation cycles. Addressing long-term application goals, this research developed a scalable and computationally efficient decision-making tool (the "AI co-founder"), validated in realistic mobility venture scenarios. Long-term implications include facilitating sustainable, scalable entrepreneurial strategies widely applicable across various sectors, significantly enhancing innovation ecosystems by aligning startup strategies closely with societal utilities and improving economic resilience through informed decision-making. Future research involves empirical field testing with real-world startups, further enhancing model validity and practical applicability.                                 | Afeyan & Pisano (2024); Stern et al.

Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC), paired with Bayesian Entrepreneurship (BE), addresses critical limitations across practical limitations of applying four methods. 

SBC mitigates Optimization method's tendency toward narrow metrics by validating these metrics with real-world feedback, aligning decisions with broader entrepreneurial goals. For instance, entrepreneurs should regularly check if lowering supply chain costs actually leads to market success (tesla overestimating cost labor to supply chain cost). 

For Agent-Based Simulation, SBC reduces calibration complexity by reliably calibrating detailed agent parameters despite uncertainty at broader levels, uncovering emergent system behaviors.  For instance, such as accurately modeling customer adoption patterns even without complete data (moshe's stratified sampling + iterative population fitting).

In Differential Equation Simulation, SBC supports flexible recalibration of model parameters, counteracting rigid structures that might diverge from observed realities.  For instance, "?"

Lastly, SBC helps Bayesian methods handle novel conditions effectively by maintaining reliable detailed decisions even when broader entrepreneurial assumptions or priors remain uncertain, enhancing practical adaptability and responsiveness. For instance, "?" Bayes in holes

# Bayesian Calibrated Choice (BCC)

## Hypotheses
This thesis examines two fundamental hypotheses about Bayesian Calibrated Choice (BCC). First, BCC provides an effective framework through its self-consistent learning rule, which we demonstrate through simulation-based calibration. Second, BCC offers computational efficiency by reducing the dimensionality of the exploration problem, analyzed from both individual founders' and society's perspectives.

## Chapter 1: Research Objective 

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
could you make research objective more coherent with hypothesis? also, "a framework for understanding the sources of belief heterogeneity, and algorithms for both societal matching and individual pathfinding in entrepreneurial decision-making." seems less relevant with what comes before.

In business and economics, calibration serves as a crucial foundation for value-based action. While Bayesian theorem provides a philosophical foundation for calibration, traditional sequential decision-making applications assume state and actions are given. However, in entrepreneurial contexts, states that affect actions can always be decomposed further, making the distinction between state and action fluid. This thesis addresses this challenge by developing two key components: a framework for understanding the sources of belief heterogeneity, and algorithms for both societal matching and individual pathfinding in entrepreneurial decision-making.
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
## Chapter 2: Theoretical Background on Bayesian Calibrated Choice

### 2.1 Foundations of BCC

#### 2.1.1 Optimization Approach
The optimization approach integrates insights from decision science and statistical decision theory as developed by Charlie, alongside discrete choice analysis from Mosche. This foundation provides the mathematical framework for understanding how agents optimize their choices under uncertainty.

#### 2.1.2 Bayesian Approach
The Bayesian approach combines Bayesian statistics, pioneered by Andrew, with Bayesian cognition developed by Josh. This integration encompasses SBC/prior/posterior re-calibration, Bayes factor analysis, rational meaning construction, and inverse planning for mental model inference, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how agents update their beliefs and make decisions.

#### 2.1.3 Simulation Approach
System dynamics, as developed by John, along with dynamic modeling and calibration techniques from Tom, provide the foundation for our simulation approach. This framework incorporates MCMC methods to simulate and analyze complex decision-making processes in entrepreneurial contexts.

#### 2.1.4 Bayesian Calibrated Choice Integration
BCC synthesizes optimization, Bayesian, and simulation approaches into a unified framework that emphasizes context-dependent calibration. This integration leverages system dynamics concepts of flows and stocks to model the interplay between actions and states in entrepreneurial decision-making.

### 2.2 Application in Entrepreneurship

#### 2.2.1 Bayesian X Optimization
The integration of Bayesian methods with optimization theory provides a novel framework for understanding entrepreneurial decision-making. This approach specifically addresses how entrepreneurs handle the duality between states and actions while pursuing opportunities without regard to currently controlled resources.

#### 2.2.2 Bayesian X Simulation
Simulation-based calibration reveals the advantages of non-centered parameterization over centered parameterization in entrepreneurial contexts. This framework helps explain how entrepreneurs can effectively navigate uncertainty through iterative learning and adaptation.

#### 2.2.3 BCC Framework
The complete BCC framework synthesizes optimization and simulation approaches while emphasizing context-dependent calibration. This integration provides a robust foundation for analyzing entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty.

| **Hypothesis**                         | 1. BCC is effective as it provides `self-consistent learning rule`. I implement this using simulation-based calibration.<br>2. BCC is efficient as it reduces the dimensionality of the exploration problem. I analyze this dimension reduction process in both individual (founder) and society's perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Chapter 1: Research Objective**      | • In business and economics, calibration is crucial for value-based action<br>• Bayesian theorem provides philosophical foundation for calibration,<br>• sequential decision making applications assumes state and actions are given. however in reality, state that affects action can always be found (robot's repeated action of bumping into the wall can help it go outside the box). For entrepreneurs who naturally explore uncharted territory, state and action becomes both action. what's needed is 1) understanding the source of belief heterogeneity and 2) developing 2s) society's  👥matching algorithm (between beliefs encoding (meaning) and preferences (judging)) 2i) individual's 🚗path finding algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Cases in startup investment
Cases in strategic decision-making

First Paragraph:
PayPal's founding story illustrates a fundamental challenge in entrepreneurial theory-building. The founders developed a causal theory where θ (encryption technology working) was hypothesized as critical for Y (company success). They operated under two interconnected beliefs: P(Y|θ=1) suggested a high probability of success with working encryption, while P(Y|θ=0) indicated near-zero chance of success without it. This theoretical framework wasn't just about predicting success given encryption capability (forward prediction); it fundamentally shaped their strategic decisions about resource allocation and technology development priorities.

Second Paragraph:
The need for calibration emerges when we recognize that entrepreneurial theories can be tested bidirectionally. While PayPal's founders focused on P(Y|θ) (probability of success given encryption works), equally important is P(θ|Y) (probability that encryption was crucial given success). This bidirectional relationship introduces a natural symmetry in belief validation - if encryption is truly critical, we should observe both that companies with encryption tend to succeed AND that successful companies tend to have strong encryption. However, founders often focus primarily on the forward direction (θ → Y) while underutilizing the valuable information contained in the reverse direction (Y → θ). This asymmetric attention to causal relationships can lead to miscalibrated beliefs about what truly drives success.

| Probability Notation | Description                                          | PayPal's Context                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P(θ)                 | Prior probability of encryption technology working   | Founders' initial belief about likelihood of developing working encryption |
| P(Y\|θ=1)            | Probability of success given encryption works        | Founders' belief that working encryption would lead to success             |
| P(Y\|θ=0)            | Probability of success given encryption doesn't work | Founders' belief that success was unlikely without encryption              |
| P(θ\|Y=1)            | Probability encryption was crucial given success     | Validation measure: among successful companies, how many needed encryption |
| P(Y)                 | Overall probability of success                       | Weighted average: P(Y\|θ=1)P(θ) + P(Y\|θ=0)(1-P(θ))                        |

Third Paragraph: The symmetry between θ (actual encryption capability) and θ̃ (founders' prior belief about encryption) in PayPal's case reveals a crucial aspect of Bayesian calibration. Just as founders can simulate forward from their beliefs about encryption to predict success, we can work backward from observed successes to validate those beliefs. This symmetry suggests that if the founders' theory about encryption's importance is well-calibrated, then both forward prediction (P(Y|θ)) and backward inference (P(θ|Y)) should yield consistent probabilities. The four key equations from SBC framework provide a systematic way to check this consistency: the self-consistency equation ensures the prior maintains its structure through data averaging, the joint distributions (both population and MP2 decompositions) verify the symmetry between believed and actual importance of encryption, and the three-step procedure offers a practical way to validate these beliefs through simulation.

|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| 🔄Self Consistency (1) | πprior(θ) = ∫∫ πpost(θ\|y)πobs(y\|θ̃)πprior(θ̃) dy dθ̃ | The overall belief about encryption's importance should remain consistent whether assessed directly or through observing multiple startups' outcomes |
| 🍾Population Decomposition (2) | πSBC(y, θ, θ̃) = πprior(θ̃)πobs(y\|θ̃)πpost(θ\|y) | PayPal's prior belief about encryption (θ̃), observed market success given encryption (y\|θ̃), and updated beliefs about encryption's importance (θ\|y) should form a coherent story |
| 📖MP2 Decomposition (3) | πSBC(y, θ, θ̃) = πmarg(y)πpost(θ\|y)πpost(θ̃\|y) | If encryption truly matters, successful companies (y) should show both high prior belief in encryption (θ̃) and actual encryption capability (θ) |

pre-Bayesian exchangeability-based surprise.
This idea relates to the unexpected discovery that two seemingly unrelated things work well together, leading to the suspicion of a hidden or latent parameter connecting them. You used the mRNA platform as an example to illustrate this concept. In this context, you likely explained how researchers or companies might have been surprised to find that mRNA technology, initially developed for one purpose, proved effective in multiple, apparently unrelated applications. This surprising effectiveness across different domains led to the hypothesis that there might be an underlying, previously unrecognized parameter or principle (the latent parameter) that explains why the mRNA platform works so well in various contexts. Your comment seems to have been exploring how this type of unexpected discovery can lead to new insights and potentially reshape our understanding of a technology or scientific principle. It also touches on how such surprises can guide further research and development efforts, as investigators try to identify and understand the latent parameters that might explain the observed successes. This idea of "exchangeability-based surprise" appears to be a novel or less common concept that you were introducing or explaining in the context of hierarchical modeling and the development of platform technologies like mRNA.

By casting founder's journey of innovation as network flow problem where belief flow is conserved as 1, I operationalize the flow balance as an algorithm to  with low uncertainty origin and (from idea inception to impact), we interpreting the meaning of flow balance from both individual (founder and investor) and social welfare planner's perspective. 


Startup investing is about more than just providing capital for the highest ROI. Startup investors who believe in founders, support their journey, and strategize on transforming vision into reality, are abundance-mindset leaders who embrace investing for impact and returns. Investors today focus on building relationships, offering strategic guidance, and creating lasting impact, transforming the traditional approach of 1 in 10 of startup surviving to a more mindful 9 out of 10 survival rate for customer-centric startups.


Why is probabilistic reasoning not well adopted in our lives? First goal of this thesis is to find the root cause of this problem. Categorizing failure modes with value chain process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) suggest actionable solutions for each. Second goal is to suggest tools that address root cause. cannot consider different usecase context. 

Using the chemical equation below, I show end to end value chain of  `Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS` . Chemical equation of this goal 
`Probabilistic Reasoning SOL + Probabilistic Reasoning NEED -> usable Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS`

The value chain includes five process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) which can be catalyzed by five stakeholders (algorithm builder, tool builder, model builder, policy designer, stakeholder). Instance of this equation class is:

```
Bayesian Reasoning SOL + Bayesian Entrepreneurship NEED - (catalyze) -> usable Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS
```


In entrepreneurial system, Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS is low (Fine et. al. 2022). I'd like to catalyze  chemical equation. 

In 2016, I was shocked from an interview with bakery owners that the simplest regression based demand forecasting and inventory optimization algorithms are not used. This led me to start a startup that develop smart and simple analytics tool. Three lessons I learned:
- prioritize goal (primary: learn why analytics tools are not used, secondary: add startup to my career which is helpful for studying abroad) and communicate
- understand startup and CEO are different agents
- understand existence of different entrepreneurial strategies: architectural (compete and control) vs value chain strategy (collaborate and execute)
- massive adoption of probabilistic reasoning needs
