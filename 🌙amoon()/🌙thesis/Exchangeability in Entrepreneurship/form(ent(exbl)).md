Abstract: Entrepreneurs launching new ventures face two distinct uncertainties: whether customers want their solution (market potential φ) and whether they can deliver it effectively (implementation effectiveness θ). We develop a practical framework to help entrepreneurs decide between three testing strategies: no testing, testing only market potential, or testing both market potential and implementation together. Using a Bayesian approach, we show how this choice depends on three key factors: test costs, available resources, and expected value gains from each type of learning. We demonstrate our framework through contrasting cases in coffee retail and electric vehicle manufacturing, revealing how different industry contexts and prior beliefs shape optimal testing strategies. The paper provides both a rigorous statistical foundation for entrepreneurial learning and an actionable decision algorithm for practitioners choosing between different market testing approaches.

  

## 1. Statistical model

  

This table presents a framework for evaluating market testing strategies through two concrete examples: premium coffee retail and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing. The model uses two key parameters: ${\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}}$ (phi), which represents the fundamental market potential or the value of an idea, and ${\color{#DC143C}{\theta}}$ (theta), which measures implementation effectiveness. These parameters are estimated using prior distributions (denoted by ${\color{#000080}{M_0}}$) and can be updated through different types of market tests. The framework compares two testing approaches: testing only market potential ($\Delta E^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}}$), such as conducting surveys or prototypes, versus testing both market potential and implementation together ($\Delta E^{{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}},{\color{#DC143C}{\theta}}}$), like opening a pilot store or production line. The choice between these approaches depends on their relative expected values and costs ($c^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}}$ vs. $c^{{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}}{\color{#DC143C}{\theta}}}$), helping managers make informed decisions about their market testing strategy.

### 1.1 Market Testing Optimization Model

  

This formulation states that the entrepreneur chooses an action \(a \in A\) (no test, test \(\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}\), or test \(\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}\times \textcolor{#DC143C}{\theta}\)) to **maximize** the net expected value \(\Delta E(a) = E[V \mid a] - c(a)\), subject to a **budget constraint** \(c(a)\leq B\). Concretely, if the entrepreneur tests **only market potential** \(\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}\), then they incur cost \(c^{\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}}\) but update beliefs about \(\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}\) from \(\textcolor{#000080}{M_0}\) to \(\textcolor{#000080}{M_1^{\phi}}\), yielding \(\Delta E^{\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}} > 0\) if the improved knowledge sufficiently outweighs that cost. Alternatively, testing **implemented idea** (\(\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \textcolor{#DC143C}{\theta}\)) is more expensive but can refine both the **idea** and **execution** parameters, potentially leading to \(\Delta E^{\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}, \textcolor{#DC143C}{\theta}} > 0\) if the combined insight justifies its higher investment. If both tests and “no test” are possible, the choice that maximizes \(\Delta E(a)\) becomes the **optimal** course of action.

$$

\max_{a \in A} \Delta E(a) = E[V|a] - c(a)

$$

  

where:

$$

A = \{\text{no\_test}, \text{test}_{\phi}, \text{test}_{\phi\theta}\}

$$

  

Subject to:

$$

\begin{aligned}

1. &\quad \text{Budget constraint: } c(a) \leq B \\[0.5em]

2. &\quad \Delta E^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}} = \mathbb{E}_{M_1^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}}}[\color{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \color{#DC143C}{\theta}] - \mathbb{E}_{M_0}[\color{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \color{#DC143C}{\theta}] - c^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}} \\[0.5em]

3. &\quad \Delta E^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}, \color{#DC143C}{\theta}} = \mathbb{E}_{M_1^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}, \color{#DC143C}{\theta}}}[\color{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \color{#DC143C}{\theta}] - \mathbb{E}_{M_0}[\color{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \color{#DC143C}{\theta}] - c^{\color{#20B2AA}{\phi}, \color{#DC143C}{\theta}}

\end{aligned}

$$

### 1.2 Algorithm

  

$$

\textbf{Algorithm: Choose Testing Strategy}

$$

  

### Inputs:

$$

c_{\phi}, \quad c_{\phi,\theta}, \quad \Delta E^{\phi}, \quad \Delta E^{\phi,\theta}, \quad \mathrm{resource} \geq 0.

$$

  

### Step 1: Check feasibility and positivity.

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

\text{feasibleIdea} &:= \bigl[\mathrm{resource} \geq c_{\phi} \bigr] \wedge \bigl[\Delta E^{\phi} > 0 \bigr]. \\[0.5em]

\text{feasibleImpl} &:= \bigl[\mathrm{resource} \geq c_{\phi,\theta} \bigr] \wedge \bigl[\Delta E^{\phi,\theta} > 0 \bigr].

\end{aligned}

$$

  

### Step 2: Decision Logic.

  

(a) **If neither feasible:**

$$

\textbf{if} \quad \neg \text{feasibleIdea} \quad \wedge \quad \neg \text{feasibleImpl} \quad \textbf{then} \quad \text{No Test.}

$$

  

(b) **If both feasible:**

$$

\textbf{else if} \quad \text{feasibleIdea} \wedge \text{feasibleImpl}

$$

$$

\begin{aligned}

\textbf{if} \quad \Delta E^{\phi} > \Delta E^{\phi,\theta} \quad \textbf{then} \quad \text{Test Idea;} \\[0.5em]

\textbf{else} \quad \text{Test Implemented Idea.}

\end{aligned}

$$

  

(c) **If only Idea feasible:**

$$

\textbf{else if} \quad \text{feasibleIdea} \quad \textbf{then} \quad \text{Test Idea.}

$$

  

(d) **If only Implementation feasible:**

$$

\textbf{else} \quad \text{Test Implemented Idea.}

$$

  

### Algorithm: Choose Testing Strategy

The algorithm enforces both resource feasibility ($\mathrm{resource} \geq c_{\phi}$ or $c_{\phi,\theta}$) and net expected value positivity ($\Delta E^\phi > 0$ or $\Delta E^{\phi,\theta} > 0$). First, it checks if neither idea test nor implemented‐idea test is feasible and beneficial; if not, it prescribes “No Test.” Next, if both are valid, it compares $\Delta E^\phi$ and $\Delta E^{\phi,\theta}$ directly, recommending whichever yields higher net gain. Finally, if only the idea test is valid, it picks that, or vice versa. This ensures that only feasible, positive‐value tests get selected, clarifying whether the entrepreneur should skip testing, test only $\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi}$, or test $\textcolor{#20B2AA}{\phi} \times \textcolor{#DC143C}{\theta}$.

### 2.1.2 sensitivity plot

This plot reveals how implementation effectiveness (θ) influences the choice between market-only testing and full implementation testing for different market potential scenarios. The y-axis shows the difference in expected value between the two testing strategies, where positive values favor market-only testing and negative values favor implementation testing. The downward slopes for both high and low true market value cases indicate that as implementation effectiveness increases (moving right on the x-axis), the advantage of market-only testing diminishes. However, the high true value case (brown line) maintains a stronger preference for market-only testing across all θ values, suggesting that when the market potential is truly high, entrepreneurs are better off conducting market-only tests first, even with good implementation capabilities. The density plot on the right shows this effect is more variable for high true value scenarios.

A coffee startup evaluating entry into the U.S. market faces a fundamental decision: should it first test market demand for premium coffee (**φ**) or proceed directly with an **implementation strategy** (**θ**)? Idea validation (**c_φ**) involves running blind taste tests or consumer surveys to determine whether customers recognize and prefer high-quality coffee. Alternatively, the company can commit to an **implementation strategy**, either selling brewed coffee (Starbucks model) or packaged beans (Peet’s model), incurring an **implemented idea test cost (c_φθ)**. The **realized profitability (y)** is binary, where **y = 1** indicates financial success only if both **φ** (market demand) and **θ** (implementation) are strong. This hierarchical **Beta-Bernoulli model** captures the entrepreneur’s choice between testing and immediate implementation, where learning updates prior beliefs about demand (**a_φ, b_φ**) and implementation effectiveness (**a_θ, b_θ**).

  

Unlike coffee, where modeling assumption of discrete market validation (good vs. bad) is acceptable, electric vehicle (EV) adoption depends on continuous trade-offs in market demand (**φ**) and implementation effectiveness (**θ**). A car manufacturer like Tesla or Toyota must decide whether to validate demand for EVs before committing to large-scale production. Idea validation (**c_φ**) may involve prototype testing or consumer surveys to estimate willingness to pay, while an **implemented idea test** (**c_φθ**) includes pilot production or limited regional releases. The **realized profitability (y)** is a continuous measure, reflecting financial success based on **φ** (consumer demand) and **θ** (production scalability).

  

Because profitability outcomes are no longer binary but instead vary across a range of values, a **computational approach becomes essential** for modeling realistic decision-making. A **Normal-Beta model** generalizes implementation effectiveness (**a_θ, b_θ**) across multiple scenarios, requiring Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulations to track how **beliefs evolve with each market observation**. Unlike in the coffee example, where discrete testing suffices, **EV adoption involves dynamic adjustments**, such as pricing strategies, technological advancements, and policy shifts. Capturing these **complex interactions necessitates computational modeling**, making a normal distribution a more suitable framework for decision-making.

Our model encapsulates two key uncertainties:

- Prior: Beta(aφ, bφ) reflecting initial market research

- Success = positive customer feedback

- Failure = negative feedback

  

5. Implementation (θ): Can your team deliver consistently?

  

- Prior: Beta(aθ, bθ) based on staff experience

- Success = proper execution

- Failure = service issues

- y = 1 if (φ = Good AND θ = Good)

- y = 0 otherwise

### briding🌉 2.1 and 2.2

While coffee quality perception is often discrete (good vs. bad), decision-making in industries like electric vehicles involves continuous trade-offs, such as battery range, cost, and manufacturing efficiency. EV success depends on **gradual variations in both idea quality (market demand) and implementation effectiveness (cost efficiency, supply chain constraints),** requiring a model that captures **incremental improvements, investment trade-offs, and continuous learning from market signals.** This motivates our shift to a normal distribution framework in Section 2.2, allowing for more nuanced updates and strategic adjustments.

  

### 2.2🚗 EV Context (Normal Distribution Extension)

  
  

## 3. Implications

Table compares **Sec. 2.1 (Coffee: Peet’s vs Starbucks)**, **Sec. 2.2 (EV: Better Place vs Tesla)**, and **Sec. 2.3 (EV: Toyota vs Tesla)**. Each row references the relevant “🔑table titles” from #🗄️scott to highlight how these examples differ in terms of the Four Axioms, Strategy Compass, key uncertainties, etc.

  

## 1) Fundamental Difference (Sec. 2.2 vs Sec. 2.3) in Scott’s Terms

  

In **Sec. 2.2 (Better Place vs Tesla)**, both players are *entrants* attempting to deliver new “system innovations” (to use Table 2’s language) for EV technology. This scenario reflects a *Disruptor or Architectural orientation*—no incumbent is dominating, so each entrant is searching for an advantage in a relatively open market structure. According to Scott’s **Four Axioms** (Table 1), there is significant *Uncertainty* about which new EV approach (battery-swap vs. integrated battery + charger network) will best create and capture value, and both must manage *Noisy Learning* about consumer acceptance.

  

By contrast, **Sec. 2.3 (Toyota vs Tesla)** pits an *incumbent* (Toyota) against a *disruptive entrant* (Tesla). The market for “electrified vehicles” is partially established (Toyota’s hybrids), so there is *Constraint* (Axiom 2) from Toyota’s existing capabilities and brand. Meanwhile, Tesla is embracing a *Disruptor strategy* (Table 2) and invests heavily in *Execution* on integrated capabilities. The fundamental difference is that Toyota’s large existing assets and brand shape its risk posture and ability to adapt, while Tesla’s path is riskier but can yield a novel architectural advantage. Thus, from Scott’s perspective, the **core contrast** in Sec. 2.3 is *incumbent vs. disruptor strategies* under more direct head-to-head competition, whereas Sec. 2.2 is *two entrants* vying to shape a still-emerging EV market.

  

Below is one **crisp table** aligning each section’s example (Coffee vs. two EV scenarios) with the “🔑table titles” from #🗄️scott. We highlight how each example maps to the Four Axioms, Strategy Compass, key uncertainties, etc.

  

| **Section** | **Context & Players** | **Four Axioms (Table 1)** | **Strategy Compass (Table 2)** | **Key Uncertainty (Table 5)** | **Relevance of “Test 2 Choose 1” (Table 7)** |

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Sec. 2.1**<br>*Coffee* <br>(Peet’s vs. Starbucks) | Two *alternative* expansions of a high-quality coffee idea: <br>– Peet’s invests in artisanal beans <br>– Starbucks invests in café model | 1) **Freedom**: More than one path to create value (retail café or premium beans).<br>2) **Constraint**: Couldn’t do both at scale simultaneously. | Both lean toward *Value Chain* or partial *IP* (they focus on functional resources— sourcing/roasting vs. cafe ops). <br>(See “The Partners” in Table 2 if collaborating with supply chain) | Mostly **Epistemic**— uncertain how American consumers adopt new coffee habits. Historical data were scant for “Italian bar” concept. | Each tested, *to some extent*, a pilot. Starbucks did a “pop-up cafe.” Peet’s stuck with careful expansions. Demonstrates how parallel testing clarifies which route is more viable before committing large resources. |

| **Sec. 2.2**<br>*EV: entrant vs. entrant* <br>(Better Place vs. Tesla) | Two *newcomers* in the EV space: <br>– Better Place tries battery-swap infrastructure <br>– Tesla invests in integrated battery + charging network | 1) **Uncertainty**: No clear track record for pure EV approach <br>2) **Noisy Learning**: Pilots reveal viability of swap stations vs. integrated superchargers. | Both are closer to *Disruptor* or *Architectural* (Table 2). They are exploring “new users, new system innovations.” They differ in **execution** approach: infrastructure vs. integrated. | Primarily **Epistemic**— no established demand data for large-scale EV, plus partial *Aleatoric* from unknown consumer tastes & battery tech. | Each must “test 2 choose 1” early. Better Place invests heavily in physical swap stations, Tesla invests in battery R&D + superchargers. In parallel, they validate different system designs to see which best scales. |

| **Sec. 2.3**<br>*EV: incumbent vs. entrant* <br>(Toyota vs. Tesla) | An established automaker with hybrid success (Toyota) <br>vs. a pure-EV disruptor (Tesla) | 1) **Constraint**: Toyota’s existing brand, supply chain, & incremental approach. <br>2) **Uncertainty**: Whether Tesla’s radical integrated EV can outpace Toyota’s “hybrid-first” stance. | Toyota may lean *Value Chain* or *IP* to protect existing capabilities. Tesla uses a *Disruptor* strategy, investing in integrated capabilities for new customers. | Mixed **Epistemic** and **Aleatoric**. Toyota has partial data from hybrids. Tesla faces unknown scale-up and competitive response. | Toyota can do “learn while scaling hybrids.” Tesla “goes all-in” on pure EV. Each has to weigh cost of large pilot expansions. Testing multiple approaches is restricted for Toyota by legacy constraints, while Tesla’s approach is a high-stakes single path. |

  

**Key Takeaway**:

- **Sec. 2.1**: Two *alternative expansions* from the *same idea* (quality coffee).

- **Sec. 2.2**: Two *entrant* startups racing to define a new EV approach.

- **Sec. 2.3**: Incumbent (Toyota) vs. disruptor (Tesla) contending with legacy constraints and radically new system design.

# 1. Define prior parameters

a_phi, b_phi = 2, 2

a_theta, b_theta = 2, 2

  

# Example data:

# idea_test_result = 1 (success)

# impl_test_result = 0 (failure)

# We'll treat:

# 3. Compute the prior for each (phi,theta) on the grid

# prior_phi = Beta(a_phi, b_phi) at PHI

# prior_theta = Beta(a_theta, b_theta) at THETA

prior_phi = beta.pdf(PHI, a_phi, b_phi)

prior_theta = beta.pdf(THETA, a_theta, b_theta)

# Assuming phi and theta are independent, the joint prior is the product

PRIOR = prior_phi * prior_theta

  

# 4. Compute the likelihood from the data:

# L_idea = phi^1 * (1-phi)^0 = PHI

# L_impl = (phi*theta)^0 * (1 - phi*theta)^1 = 1 - (PHI*THETA)

L_idea = PHI

L_impl = 1 - (PHI*THETA)

  

LIKELIHOOD = L_idea * L_impl

  

# 5. Unnormalized posterior

UNSTD_POST = PRIOR * LIKELIHOOD

  

# 6. Normalize so that sum of posterior over entire grid = 1

POST = UNSTD_POST / UNSTD_POST.sum()

## Appendix

### language choice

Based on the analysis of Scott's Entreprenerial strategy and choice and Charlie's clockspeed which included around 200 sentences that used "execute" and "implement", I analyzed Scott and Charlie share fundamental views on execution/implementation as critical to venture success, particularly emphasizing capability development and systematic learning. Both scholars recognize the importance of speed and efficiency - Scott describes how "Warby Parker has executed quickly and consistently," while Charlie highlights how "Intel executed new product and process development... at breakneck speed." They also agree on the role of continuous improvement, with Scott noting how firms must "continue to execute well to maintain market position" and Charlie describing how "Toyota continuously strengthens and deepens its capabilities." Where they diverge is in their primary analytical lens: Scott frames execution primarily as a strategic choice against control, exemplified in the Salesforce case where "focusing on execution" meant choosing against building protective "moats." Charlie, meanwhile, approaches implementation through an operational and technical perspective, focusing on "implementing clockspeed concepts" and "three-dimensional concurrent engineering." Their emphasis on trade-offs also differs slightly: Scott highlights the tension between speed and protection ("execute quickly while evading incumbent detection"), while Charlie focuses more on integration challenges ("Toyota struggled when it tried to implement global three-dimensional concurrent engineering from a highly integral supply base"). However, these differences appear more complementary than contradictory - Scott's strategic view and Charlie's operational perspective together provide a more complete understanding of how ventures execute and implement effectively.

## 2.1☕️
## 🌉
While coffee quality perception is often discrete (good vs. bad), decision-making in industries like electric vehicles involves continuous trade-offs, such as battery range, cost, and manufacturing efficiency. EV success depends on **gradual variations in both idea quality (market demand) and implementation effectiveness (cost efficiency, supply chain constraints),** requiring a model that captures **incremental improvements, investment trade-offs, and continuous learning from market signals.** This motivates our shift to a normal distribution framework in Section 2.2, allowing for more nuanced updates and strategic adjustments.

## 2.2🚗




"An entrepreneur can learn about their venture in two ways:
- Test idea quality directly (e.g., customer surveys)
- Test specific implementations (e.g., pilot products)
Each test has a cost, and the entrepreneur needs to decide which testing approach to use."

6. Mathematical Model:

```
Core Setup:
Let y = φ * θ (profitability = idea quality × implementation effectiveness)
where:
φ ∈ {φ_bad, φ_good}     // idea quality
θ ∈ {θ_bad, θ_good}     // implementation effectiveness

Two Testing Options:
7. Test φ directly: Observe φ at cost c_φ
8. Test (φ,θ) pair: Observe y at cost c_y

Key Exchangeability Property:
p(y_1, y_2 | φ) = p(y_2, y_1 | φ)   // order of implementation doesn't affect inferred value of idea quality
```

9. Why Exchangeability Matters:
- Business Reality: Entrepreneurs often test multiple implementations of the same idea's 
- Exchangeability means: Order of testing implemented ideas doesn't affect what we learn about idea quality
- Example: Testing "coffee shop in location A then B" vs "B then A" should give same information about the quality of the core business idea

10. Decision Problem:
```
max_{d∈{test_φ, test_y}} E[V(π)] - c(d)

where:
V(π) = Expected value under belief state π
π(φ,θ|test_φ) = Direct learning about idea
π(φ,θ|test_y) = Indirect learning through implementation
```

11. Key Questions This Answers:
- When should entrepreneurs test idea vs implemented idea?
- How does exchangeability help us learn about idea quality from implemented idea tests?
- How do testing costs affect optimal learning approach?

🚨🚨🚨todo3: imagine how [[🗄️ 🧩correlation examples]] relates

Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching ½ of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by “success” is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. “Statistical significance” plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental “cuteness” and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.

12. **Atom (Physical/Hardware).** Here, founders expect **tight, uniform** performance across products (e.g., identical batteries from a factory). Any deviation (e.g., one battery charging 30 minutes vs. another 45 under the same conditions) signals that the underlying “physical process” is not truly the same—an important discovery for process improvement.
13. **Bit (Software/Behavior/Market Segments).** Here, founders **expect** variation (e.g., how different customer groups adopt a new app). Surprisingly _similar_ outcomes can be the big news (e.g., both “luxury buyers” and “eco-conscious buyers” giving equally high ratings)—revealing an unexpected _common_ acceptance factor.

This duality implies **asymmetric testing**: hardware-like domains benefit from “physics-grade” tight thresholds (Meehl’s “strong tests”), while psychology-like domains risk “crud factor” false positives if we rely solely on a p-value. We aim to integrate **exchangeability** so that the model can systematically handle _when_ items (or data points) should be treated as “essentially the same” versus “likely different.”

$P(X_1 = x_1,\dots, X_n = x_n \mid \theta_{\text{atom}}) \;=\; P\!\bigl(X_{\pi(1)} = x_1,\dots, X_{\pi(n)} = x_n \;\bigm|\; \theta_{\text{atom}}\bigr)$,

as long as all $X_i$ share the same underlying process. **A single surprising deviation** (e.g., a large outlier) can falsify “perfect exchangeability,” prompting the entrepreneur to refine or subdivide the process model.

On the **software/psychological** side, we start with a prior assumption that different market segments $Y_j$ or product variations might _not_ be exchangeable. Instead, we specify a **hierarchical** or **partial-exchangeability** prior:

$(Y_1,\dots, Y_m) \;\sim\; \int p(Y_1,\dots, Y_m \mid \phi)\; dP(\phi)$

where $\phi$ is a higher-level parameter capturing potential commonalities. Observing an unexpected _similarity_ (i.e., data showing that segments are more exchangeable than presumed) is an important revision—akin to discovering a single “core adoption driver” across groups.
