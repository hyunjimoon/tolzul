### Abstract

This paper systematically reviews 340 studies that discuss patent quality and patent value, consolidating these concepts into a multi-dimensional framework grounded in the ‚Äúex-ante theory of patent value.‚Äù The authors show that patent quality (defined by conformance to regulatory patentability requirements: subject matter, utility, non-obviousness, and sufficiency of disclosure) precedes patent value. They identify multiple value dimensions (private vs. social) and map various indicators (renewal, litigation, forward citations, licensing, etc.) onto these dimensions. The result is an integrated conceptual model explaining how patent quality influences patent value and offering guidance for scholarly research and policy.

| 1. Introduction                                           | How can we unify the concepts of ‚Äúpatent quality‚Äù and ‚Äúpatent value‚Äù under a single conceptual lens?                | ‚Ä¢ Emergent ex-ante theory of patent value (Perel, 2014)‚Ä¢ Prior systematic reviews on patent value (van Zeebroeck & van Pottelsberghe, 2011; Grimaldi & Cricelli, 2020)‚Ä¢ Triadic patent offices (USPTO, EPO, JPO) patentability standards (Thomas, 2002; Martinez & Guellec, 2004) | Quality and value in patents are interrelated but rarely distinguished in the literature. The paper proposes that ‚Äúquality‚Äù (conformance to patentability standards) has temporal precedence over eventual ‚Äúvalue.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                      | None                                                              |
| 2. Theoretical Foundations                                | What is the ex-ante theory of patent value, and how does it define patent quality?                                  | ‚Ä¢ Definition of patent quality as conformance to statutory requirements (35 USC 101, 102, 103; EPC articles)‚Ä¢ Distinguishing ‚Äúquality‚Äù from ‚Äúvalue‚Äù from both regulatory and managerial standpoints                                                                               | Patent quality is definable ex ante (subject matter, utility, inventive step, disclosure), while value‚Äîprivate or social‚Äîemerges ex post based on exploitation, commercialization, and knowledge diffusion.                                                                                                                                                                              | None                                                              |
| 3. Review Methodology & Publication-Level Analysis        | How did the authors identify and screen relevant research on patent quality/value?                                  | ‚Ä¢ PRISMA standards (Moher et al., 2009)‚Ä¢ Systematic search in WoS and Google Scholar (340 final papers)‚Ä¢ Publication trends, distribution by journal, leading contributors                                                                                                        | A robust multi-step search & inclusion procedure reveals sharp growth in patent quality/value research post-1990s.

| 4. Patent Quality & Value Indicators                      | What specific indicators measure patent quality (pre-grant) and patent value (post-grant)?                          | ‚Ä¢ Past uses of citation-based indicators, claims, family size, etc. (Hall et al., 2005; van Zeebroeck & van Pottelsberghe, 2011)‚Ä¢ Direct measures of value (auctions, licensing revenues) vs. proxies (renewals, litigation, forward citations)                                   | Pre-grant indicators cluster around filing strategy, claims structure, sufficiency of disclosure, and examiner interactions. Post-grant indicators include knowledge diffusion (forward cites), legal/economic/technological impacts, and knowledge internalization. Direct $ measures are rare but definitive.                                                                          | Tables A1-A3 in Appendices (indicator listings)                   |
| 5. Conceptual Model: Dimensions of Patent Quality & Value | How do the identified indicators map onto the four dimensions of patent quality and two dimensions of patent value? | ‚Ä¢ Triadic offices require subject matter, utility, novelty & non-obviousness, disclosure (USPTO, EPO, JPO statutes)‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúPrivate value‚Äù vs. ‚Äúsocial value‚Äù of patents (Harhoff et al., 2003; Baron & Delcamp, 2012)                                                                  | Fourfold patent quality: subject matter, utility, inventive step, sufficiency of disclosure. Twofold patent value: private vs. social. Each dimension is linked to its own subset of indicators. The conceptual framework (Figure 5) links patent quality to patent value, with firm-level factors, contextual variables, and time as moderating influences.                             | Fig 5: Integrated conceptual model linking patent quality & value |
| 6. Future Research Directions                             | What are the gaps for empirical and theoretical advances on patent quality and value?                               | ‚Ä¢ Resource-constrained cognition in measuring novelty (Hedge & Sampat, 2009)‚Ä¢ Machine learning approaches to patent quality (Goebel et al., 2018)‚Ä¢ Impact of endogeneity & causality in analyzing the quality-value relationship                                                  | Calls for improved causal inference (instrumental variables, matching, or discontinuity designs) and attention to context-specific usage of indicators (litigation & commercialization remain underexplored). Also warns about mixing contradictory indicators in composite measures without clarity on theoretical framing.                                                             | None                                                              |
| 7. Conclusions                                            | What is the final stance on bridging quality and value?                                                             | ‚Ä¢ Presumption of validity vs. actual industrial use or commercialization‚Ä¢ Potential conflicts (e.g., ‚Äúbroad vs. narrow‚Äù rights)                                                                                                                                                   | Patent quality and value are not identical; they are multidimensional concepts with partial overlaps. Strategies to improve ‚Äúquality‚Äù (better conformance to patentability standards) can reduce patent office backlogs and raise overall system legitimacy. Meanwhile, aligning high-quality patents with higher private and social value fosters more efficient innovation ecosystems. | None                                                              |

### How Exchangeability Applies (Optional Add-On)

_(Not a formal table item but clarifies a Bayesian/hierarchical perspective in these discussions‚Äîparticularly relevant to sampling-based frameworks, though the second paper does not dwell on exchangeability in depth. If you need a #üóÑÔ∏è style row for ‚Äúexchangeability,‚Äù you can adapt the structure above.)_
