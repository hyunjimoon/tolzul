ðŸš¨ TODO: Clarify that controlling update frequency is natural in Bayesian modeling which treats every variable as random - e.g., dividing data by half and updating the prior is equivalent to updating with entire data

### **C1'** - Push-Pull Strategic Integration

**From post-it content:** "Conclusion 1 Quality Prescription given predicted Stakeholder Commitment is approximate alg (heuristic) to solve (Quality, 1st param, Stakeholder) that minimize expected Cost."

**Module Instructions:** 
- Provide the core strategic prescription linking quality decisions to cost minimization
- Reinforce "choose then optimize" as validated strategic principle
- Provide specific prescription - entrepreneurs should choose quality levels that minimize expected mismatch costs between supply-side capabilities and demand-side commitments
- Position these prescriptions as both practical guidance and theoretical contribution
- Create foundation for "Enable Next Cycle" by suggesting how this approach scales to other entrepreneurial decisions

**Key Insight:** Interpret push and pull to propose push-pull (jointly optimize q, rp, c) and proves its supremacy that converges to the same optimal solution more robustly and efficiently

**Real-World Application:** This simultaneous optimization of stakeholder priority and quality treats both as random variables within an agent-based modeling framework, enabling:
- **2D Space Exploration:** More robust optimization by exploring both dimensions simultaneously rather than fixing one
- **Flexible/Agile Production:** Enables quicker adaptation and decision-making within the same timeframe ("living 48 hours in a day")
- **Doubled Bayesian Update Frequency:** Tesla example - update every 6 months instead of annually by considering both customer and resource partner reactions as random variables
- **Faster Feedback Loops:** Critical for rapidly changing industries where fixed models quickly become outdated
