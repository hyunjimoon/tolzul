Our primal-dual framework illuminates three distinct operational strategies for entrepreneurial quality decisions. The push strategy (primal problem) takes market parameters β as given and optimizes quality q*, appropriate when creating new markets where customer preferences are undefined (β ≈ 0) or when breakthrough innovations require quality jumps exceeding 50%. The pull strategy (dual problem) reverses this logic, using quality experiments to reveal true market parameters β, optimal when established markets provide measurable feedback and rapid iteration cycles enable continuous learning. The push-pull hybrid represents joint optimization in (q, β) space, finding equilibrium where quality choices and market responses are mutually consistent—particularly relevant for platform businesses where product features and user preferences co-evolve.

The choice among these strategies depends on three operational conditions: market existence, parameter measurability, and iteration capability. Entrepreneurs should employ push when facing all three constraints: SpaceX's reusable rockets exemplify this as (1) no market existed for rocket reusability, (2) launch customers couldn't articulate preferences for an untested technology (β ≈ 0), and (3) multi-year development cycles precluded rapid iteration. Pull dominates when all conditions favor learning: Netflix's content recommendations demonstrate this with (1) established streaming markets, (2) measurable view-completion rates revealing β, and (3) daily algorithm updates based on user behavior. Joint push-pull optimization suits platforms where quality and preferences co-evolve: Uber simultaneously pushed ride-sharing quality while pulling user responsiveness data, where (1) the market formed around safety features and wait times, (2) quality sensitivity β emerged through usage patterns revealing how driver ratings affected ride acceptance, and (3) service features and user quality expectations mutually adapted through continuous platform updates. This framework thus provides rigorous theoretical grounding for matching entrepreneurial strategy to operational constraints.

**Push vs. Pull Definitions:**

- **Push:** Emphasizing detailed planning and control; anticipating everything in advance.
- **Pull:** Emphasizing continuous adjustment to real-time information; decentralized planning + responding directly to new info.

Here is the comparison table:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Algorithm**|**Primary Focus**|**Push / Pull Classification**|**Rationale**|
|**1. Given (Quality, Cost) → Optimize Stakeholders**|Determining the _implied_ stakeholder responsiveness parameters (βc​,βr​) that justify a given quality and cost.|**Pull**|This algorithm is reactive and diagnostic. It analyzes existing conditions (given quality and costs) to deduce the underlying stakeholder behavior. It's about understanding and responding to the current state, rather than pre-planning, aligning with continuous adjustment to information.|
|**2. Given (Quality, Stakeholders) → Optimize Cost**|Identifying the optimal cost structure (Cu​,Co​,V) for a fixed quality and known stakeholder responses.|**Pull**|This approach focuses on adapting internal financial/operational levers (costs) to match observed or predicted external realities (fixed quality, stakeholder behaviors). It's about adjusting to information that has become known or stable, rather than anticipating and setting an initial plan for external factors, thus emphasizing response to current info.|
|**3. Given (Cost, Stakeholders) → Optimize Quality**|Determining the _optimal product quality (q∗)_ given known cost parameters and stakeholder responsiveness.|**Push**|This is the forward, prescriptive problem. It involves setting the optimal quality _before_ market interaction, based on anticipated costs and stakeholder behaviors. This requires detailed planning and control, aiming to anticipate market responses and define the product attribute (quality) upfront, which is characteristic of a push strategy.|
