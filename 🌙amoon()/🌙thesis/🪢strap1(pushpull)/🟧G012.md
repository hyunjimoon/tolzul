# 🟧G0: Classic Newsvendor on Quantity of Perishable

The classic newsvendor model addresses a fundamental inventory challenge: determining optimal order quantity q when facing uncertain demand D with cumulative distribution F(·). The entrepreneur minimizes expected cost EC(q) =c∫₀^q (q-x)f(x)dx + (p-c)∫_q^∞ (x-q)f(x)dx, balancing overage costs c per unsold unit against opportunity costs (p-c) per unit of unmet demand. This yields the elegant critical fractile solution q* = F⁻¹((p-c)/p), revealing that optimal stocking increases with profit margin. The model's enduring appeal lies in its simplicity: a single decision variable (quantity) trades off a single source of uncertainty (demand) through a universal principle—stock more when margins are high, less when holding costs dominate. This framework has guided inventory decisions from newspaper stands to fashion retail, wherever products perish or obsolete before the next ordering opportunity.

# 🟧G1: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Linear Willingness to Commit

## G1.1: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Linear Willingness to Commit (Symmetric βr = βc = 1)

Step 1 transforms the newsvendor by making supply itself stochastic and quality-dependent rather than a direct decision. The entrepreneur chooses product quality q ∈ [0,1], which linearly influences customer commitment probability Pc(q) = q and inversely affects resource partner commitment Pr(q) = 1-q, creating a fundamental tension. The expected loss function L(q) = Cuq² + Co(1-q)² - Vq(1-q) captures four outcomes: successful matches (probability q(1-q)) generate value V, customer-only commitment (probability q²) incurs opportunity cost Cu, partner-only commitment (probability (1-q)²) creates overage cost Co, and no commitment incurs no cost. The optimal quality q* = (V+2Co)/(2(Cu+Co+V)) reveals the cost-priority principle: quality tilts toward avoiding the more expensive mismatch type. When overage costs dominate (Co >> Cu), firms raise quality to reduce unwanted inventory; when opportunity costs dominate (Cu >> Co), they lower quality to avoid disappointing customers. Remarkably, the match bonus V's impact direction depends on which cost is larger: ∂q*/∂V = (Cu-Co)/(2(Cu+Co+V))², positive when avoiding shortages matters more, negative when avoiding surplus matters more.

### 🚗Tesla's case 
> Tesla's initial approach exemplified this tension: every enhancement to acceleration or range (increasing q) thrilled potential luxury customers but concerned battery partners about reliability and production feasibility. The cost-priority principle reveals three key insights: (1) when overage costs dominate (Co>>Cu), optimal quality rises to pull demand and avoid expensive surplus—imagine Tesla with warehouses full of unsold Roadsters; (2) high underage costs (Cu>>Co) drive quality lower to ensure supply availability—the nightmare of taking deposits but having no batteries to deliver; (3) the match bonus V creates asymmetric effects where ∂q*/∂V = (Cu-Co)/(2(Cu+Co+V)² shows that higher rewards pull quality toward the scarcer stakeholder. This linear model, while simplified, captures the essence of the entrepreneur's dilemma: in the race against perishable commitment, every quality decision simultaneously attracts one stakeholder group while potentially alienating another.

## G1.2: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Linear Willingness to Commit (Asymmetric) - DUALITY

The asymmetric linear model introduces responsiveness parameters βc and βr, transforming commitment functions to Pc(q) = βc·q and Pr(q) = 1-βr·q, allowing stakeholders to react differently to quality signals. The expected loss becomes L(q,βr,βc) = Cu(βcq)² + Co(1-βcq)(1-βrq) - V(βcq)(1-βrq), yielding optimal quality q* = [Co(βc+βr)+Vβc]/[2(Cuβc²+Coβrβc+Vβrβc)]. This reveals a crucial duality: the firm can either optimize quality given stakeholder responsiveness (primal problem) or influence stakeholder responsiveness given quality constraints (dual problem). The dual perspective yields first-order conditions ∂L/∂βr = Coq(1-βcq)+Vβcq² = 0 and ∂L/∂βc = 2Cuβcq²-Coq(1-βrq)-Vq(1-βrq) = 0, suggesting how firms might shape stakeholder expectations through marketing or contract design. When βr = βc = 1, the model collapses to the previous case, but generally, scaled symmetric and asymmetric responsiveness creates richer dynamics where highly responsive stakeholders effectively get less weight in quality decisions—a counterintuitive result with profound implications for market positioning.

**Duality and Dimensionality Analysis:** To understand the degeneracy structure, consider the expected cost minimization as a constrained optimization problem. The decision vector x = [q, βr, βc]ᵀ contains **3 variables**, while the operational reality imposes constraints. In the primal formulation min L(q,βr,βc), if we fix responsiveness parameters (βr=βr₀, βc=βc₀), we have a **1-variable** problem in q with **2 equality constraints**, yielding constraint matrix A of dimension **2×3** with rank 2, leaving a **1-dimensional** feasible set (a line in 3D space). In the dual formulation where q=q₀ is fixed, we optimize over [βr, βc] with **1 equality constraint**, giving A of dimension **1×3** with rank 1, creating a **2-dimensional** feasible set (a plane in 3D space). The full integrated problem with all three variables free has **0 equality constraints** beyond domain boundaries, making the feasible set **3-dimensional**. The visualization reveals how operational constraints fundamentally shape the solution space geometry: fixing two responsiveness parameters (primal) collapses the 3D decision space to a 1D line where only quality can vary, fixing quality (dual) creates a 2D plane for exploring stakeholder responsiveness, while the unconstrained integrated approach preserves the full 3D manifold. This dimensional analysis demonstrates why the asymmetric linear model exhibits such rich behavior—the constraint matrix A literally determines which degrees of freedom collapse, creating a mathematical duality where primal and dual perspectives offer complementary windows into the same underlying optimization landscape. This dimensional analysis reveals why the asymmetric case exhibits such rich behavior: the interplay between primal (quality-focused) and dual (responsiveness-focused) perspectives creates a manifold of solutions where operational constraints determine which dimensions collapse, fundamentally different from the symmetric case's unique intersection point.

# 🟧G2: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Non-Linear Willingness to Commit

## G2.1: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Non-Linear Willingness to Commit (Symmetric βᵣ = βc = 1)

The sigmoid model captures realistic S-shaped stakeholder responses through logistic functions Pc(q) = 1/(1+e⁻ᵍ) and Pr(q) = 1/(1+eᵍ), preserving the Bernoulli framework while reflecting empirical choice behavior. The expected loss L(q) = CuPc(1-Pr) + CoPr(1-Pc) - VPcPr remains strictly quasi-convex, ensuring a unique optimum. The first-order condition L'(q) = 0 simplifies remarkably to Pc(V+2Co) = Pr(V+2Cu), yielding the closed-form solution q* = ln((2Co+V)/(2Cu+V)). This logarithmic form reveals how sigmoid curvature moderates the cost-priority principle: when Co > Cu, quality q* > 0 pushes rightward where customers are more willing and partners less so; when Cu > Co, quality q* < 0 shifts leftward to the partner-favorable region. The match bonus V acts as a moderating force—larger V compresses the cost ratio toward unity, pulling q* toward zero where both stakeholders have equal 50% commitment probability. This elegant solution exists only because of symmetric responsiveness (βc = βr = 1); asymmetric cases require numerical methods but offer richer behavioral insights.

### 🚗 tesla example
> The sigmoid model's business implications proved profound for Tesla: the steepness of stakeholder response curves could override pure cost considerations. Their luxury customers exhibited extremely high responsiveness (large βc) to performance metrics--the difference between 0-60 in 4 seconds versus 5 seconds was make-or-break for this segment. Meanwhile, battery partners showed more gradual responses (smaller βr), creating an asymmetry that pushed Tesla toward higher quality than pure cost analysis would suggest. This explains why Tesla chose to pursue the high-performance route despite manufacturing challenges: the sharp customer response curve near the performance threshold meant that falling short would result in near-zero commitment from their target market, while the gradual partner response meant they could work through technical issues incrementally. With the illustrative parameters $C_u=1$, $C_o=V=2$ this yields $q^{*}= \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.405$ slightly below the linear model's $0.5$. Mathematically, this decrease in optimal quality is natural considering relaxed constraints on q, from [0 to 1] to ($-\infty, \infty$). More intuitively, however, this captures stakeholders' commitment saturation effect--using Tesla's example, pushing from "good" to "great" performance (quality) yields diminishing returns in customer commitment while increasing partner concerns about technical feasibility.


## G2.2: Newsvendor on Perishable Commitment from Stakeholders with Quality-Non-Linear Willingness to Commit (Asymmetric) - DUALITY

The general sigmoid model with asymmetric steepness parameters transforms commitment functions to Pc(q) = 1/(1+e⁻^βcq) and Pr(q) = 1/(1+e^βrq), where βc and βr capture each stakeholder's responsiveness to quality changes. The first-order condition becomes first-order condition $\beta_c\,P_c(1-P_c)\,\bigl[C_u(1-P_r)-(C_o+V)P_r\bigr]= \beta_r\,P_r(1-P_r)\,\bigl[(C_u+V)P_c-C_o(1-P_c)\bigr]$ which can be solved numerically, but special cases yield insights about optimality conditions of $(q, \beta_{r}, \beta_{c})$. Four limiting cases from table below yield closed-form solutions: (1) symmetric responsiveness βc=βr=β gives q*=(1/β)ln((Cu+V)/(Co+V)), (2) customer-dominant responsiveness βc>>βr yields q*=(1/βr)ln((Co+V)/Cu), (3) partner-dominant responsiveness βr>>βc produces q*=(1/βc)ln(Co/(Cu+V)), and (4) high-match-value limit V>>Cu,Co results in q*=(1/(βc+βr))ln(βr/βc). These special cases reveal a counterintuitive principle: when one stakeholder group is highly quality-sensitive, optimal strategy often means deliberately under-serving them to maintain commitment from the less responsive group. For instance, with tech-savvy customers demanding cutting-edge features (large βc) but distribution partners preferring simplicity (small βr), the optimal choice favors simpler products—the responsive customers will likely commit anyway, while pushing quality too high risks losing essential partners entirely.

|Case|Regime|Optimal Quality (q*)|Key Trade-off|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Symmetric Responsiveness**|β_c = β_r = β|(1/β) ln((2C_o + V)/(2C_u + V))|Duplicated under- vs over-commit penalties|
|**Customer-Dominant**|β_c >> β_r|(1/β_r) ln((C_o + V)/C_u)|Partner's net over-commit vs under-commit cost|
|**Partner-Dominant**|β_r >> β_c|(1/β_c) ln(C_o/(C_u + V))|Customer's net under-commit vs partner's over-commit cost|
|**High-Match-Value**|V >> C_u, C_o|(1/(β_c + β_r)) ln(β_r/β_c)|Balancing marginal gains in each sigmoid|

### 🚗 tesla example
>  For Tesla's situation with **customer‑dominant responsiveness** ($\beta_r \ll \beta_c$) the optimal quality simplifies to $q^{*}= \frac{1}{\beta_r} ln \Bigl(\tfrac{C_o+V}{C_u}\Bigr)$. With our parameters $C_u=1,;C_o=V=2$ this gives $q^{*}= \ln(4)\approx1.386$. The result explains Tesla's strategy: when customers are quality sensitive while partners react gradually, you push quality high enough to lock in customers, then work patiently with partners to reach feasibility. The model reveals four distinct market structures, each with a closed‑form solution. Beyond Tesla's customer‑dominant case, partner‑dominant scenarios ($\beta_r\gg\beta_c$) yield $q^{*}= (1/\beta_c)\ln[C_o/(C_u+V)]$, relevant for B2B ventures where supplier constraints dominate. High‑match‑value limits ($V\gg C_u,C_o$) simplify to $q^{*}=(1/(\beta_c+\beta_r))\ln(\beta_r/\beta_c)$, directly maximising joint commitment probability--applicable when network effects make successful matches extremely valuable. The **symmetric case** ($\beta_c=\beta_r=\beta$) now reads $q^{*}= \frac{1}{\beta}, \ln\Bigl(\tfrac{2C_o+V}{2C_u+V}\Bigr)$, reflecting the duplicated mismatch penalties identified in Step 2. These special cases illuminate a fundamental insight Tesla leveraged: asymmetric responsiveness "partitions" the parameter space so that one can design q in a way (high for tesla's case to ensure customer's commitment) ignore the already‑committed side and focus on the gradually responding one. Hitting the performance threshold locked in luxury buyers, allowing Tesla to concentrate negotiation and design flexibility on bringing battery partners along--an example of selective attention that outperforms naïve full‑dimensional search when commitment windows are perishable.
