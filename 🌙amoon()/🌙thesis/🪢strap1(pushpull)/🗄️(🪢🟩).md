# Summary Comparison

Entrepreneurs face a fundamental speed–accuracy trade-off across these three strategies: **prediction-only** updates beliefs on responsiveness ($\beta_c,\beta_r$) to achieve high prediction accuracy but issues a slow, perished prescription based on lagged cost parameters; **prescription-only** delivers an immediate $q^*$ under fresh cost inputs but relies on stale responsiveness estimates, sacrificing accuracy; **integrated approach** fuses real-time Bayesian updates of both $q$ and $(\beta_c,\beta_r)$ to balance rapid action with ongoing learning, at the expense of solving a higher-dimensional inference problem—which can, however, be made tractable by leveraging partial orderings (e.g. $\beta_{r} \ll \beta_{c}$) to shrink search space.
