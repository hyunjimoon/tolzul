# Table: Effectiveness Comparison (When Can Each Approach Reach q*?)

This table shows the binary effectiveness metric - whether each approach can theoretically reach the global optimal quality q* under different conditions.

| Case                        | Prediction Approach                              | Prescription Approach       | I Approach             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Can reach q*?**           | Only if costs/rewards stable (q* doesn't change) | Only if β parameters stable | Always ✓               |
| **G0: Linear**              | ✗ (q fixed at 0)                                 | ✓ (reaches q*=1/2)          | ✓ (reaches q*=1/2)     |
| **G1: Symmetric (βr=βc=1)** | ✗ (q fixed at 0)                                 | ✓ (reaches q*=ln(3/2))      | ✓ (reaches q*=ln(3/2)) |
| **G2: Asymmetric (βr<<βc)** | ✗ (q fixed at 0)                                 | ✗ (wrong q*=ln(3/2))        | ✓ (reaches q*=ln(4))   |

**Conditions for Effectiveness:**
- **Prediction**: Requires stable cost ratio (Cu/(Cu+Co+V)) so that learning β doesn't change optimal q
- **Prescription**: Requires stable β parameters so initial assumption remains valid
- **Prediction-Prescription**: No conditions - always converges to true optimum

**Key Insight**: Only the integrated approach can handle both parameter uncertainty AND cost volatility.
