Gordon Lish’s “consecution” and Gary Lutz’s “lonely place” inspire this chapter: every sentence should compel the next. Flow is less about connectors, more about unanswered resonance.

| A | Flow anxiety: digital cut‑and‑paste and revision freedom seem to break the “natural groove” of prose. |  
| D | Consecution theory (Gordon Lish) + **Lonely Place** insight (Gary Lutz): each sentence must echo the prior one while withholding just enough to invite the next. |  
| G | Examples: WordStar scissors; Bill Evans’ _Peace Piece_ ostinato; Apple’s swipe‑logic design; Kevin Lynch urban way‑finding; Mau Piailug sailing Hokule’a by stars; rhetorical anaphora/epistrophe; advice on sentence‑length audits. |  
| C | Contribution: marries **Maxim #4** (each sentence needs a clear spine) with **Maxim #13** (music of repetition‑plus‑novelty). It also previews **Maxim #9** by praising the “tiny gap” of a full stop as necessary silence. |
