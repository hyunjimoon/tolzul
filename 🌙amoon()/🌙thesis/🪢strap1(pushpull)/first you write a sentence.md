symbiosis of theory and practice (writing)

| 3              | **Nouns versus Verbs**            | Too many abstract nouns create “noun‑gravy”; vigorous verbs pump life and agency back into prose, yet excess animation can feel theatrical – seek balance            |
| 4              | **Nothing Like a Windowpane**     | Plain words, plainly ordered, can still astonish. If the idea is wild, anchor it in the simplest diction; clarity amplifies wonder.                                  |
| 5              | **The High‑wire Act**             | Long, legato sentences are a controlled walk above a void. Vary length, signal cadence, and let rhythm, not word‑count quotas, decide where to breathe.              |
| 6              | **Foolish Like a Trout**          | Flow is engineered through “consecution”: each sentence leans on a tension left unsaid in the previous one, knitting thought with invisible thread.                  |
| 7              | **A Small, Good Thing**           | A sentence is a gift – never a tax on the reader’s time. Know when to stop; delight lies in brevity, proportion and courteous silence.                               |

### Summary of Each Chapter

1. **A Pedant’s Apology**  
   Moran begins by confessing his obsession with the microscopic unit of prose – the sentence. The chapter frames writing as iterative craft: test the music in your head, read it aloud, reposition, and cut.

2. **The Ape That Writes Sentences**  
   Drawing on linguistics and evolutionary psychology, Moran argues that humans arrange words, not merely utter them. Because order cues meaning (e.g., *dog bites man* ≠ *man bites dog*), disciplined syntax is non‑negotiable.   

3. **Nouns versus Verbs**  
   Prose stagnates when abstract noun‑clusters (“modernization,” “implementation”) smother action. Verbs rekindle movement; yet over‑animating prose can turn acrobatic. Seek sentences that pulse, not preen.

4. **Nothing Like a Windowpane**  
   Contrary to Orwell’s famous metaphor, Moran shows that plainly tasted words can still shimmer. If your claim already stretches credibility, deploy the clearest lexis possible. 

5. **The High‑wire Act**  
   Long sentences resemble Philippe Petit’s tight‑rope walk: thrilling only when readers feel safe. Rhythm, readability metrics (Flesch/gunning‑fog) and strategic “in‑between space” keep the line taut without snapping.

6. **Foolish Like a Trout**  
   Gordon Lish’s “consecution” and Gary Lutz’s “lonely place” inspire this chapter: every sentence should compel the next. Flow is less about connectors, more about unanswered resonance.

7. **A Small, Good Thing**  
   Echoing Raymond Carver, Moran insists that writing respects the reader’s finite life. Books – like sentences – signal their ending early; good writers leave before the encore.
