### Summary of Each Chapter

1. 🙏**A Pedant’s Apology**  
   Moran begins by confessing his obsession with the microscopic unit of prose – the sentence. The chapter frames writing as iterative craft: test the music in your head, read it aloud, reposition, and cut.

2. 🦧**The Ape That Writes Sentences**  
   Drawing on linguistics and evolutionary psychology, Moran argues that humans arrange words, not merely utter them. Because order cues meaning (e.g., *dog bites man* ≠ *man bites dog*), disciplined syntax is non‑negotiable.   

3. 🦍**Nouns versus Verbs**  
   Prose stagnates when abstract noun‑clusters (“modernization,” “implementation”) smother action. Verbs rekindle movement; yet over‑animating prose can turn acrobatic. Seek sentences that pulse, not preen.

4. 🪟**Nothing Like a Windowpane**  
   Contrary to Orwell’s famous metaphor, Moran shows that plainly tasted words can still shimmer. If your claim already stretches credibility, deploy the clearest lexis possible. 

5. 🪢**The High‑wire Act**  
   Long sentences resemble Philippe Petit’s tight‑rope walk: thrilling only when readers feel safe. Rhythm, readability metrics (Flesch/gunning‑fog) and strategic “in‑between space” keep the line taut without snapping.

6. 🎻**Foolish Like a Trout**  
   Gordon Lish’s “consecution” and Gary Lutz’s “lonely place” inspire this chapter: every sentence should compel the next. Flow is less about connectors, more about unanswered resonance.

7. ⚰️**A Small, Good Thing**  
   Echoing Raymond Carver, Moran insists that writing respects the reader’s finite life. Books – like sentences – signal their ending early; good writers leave before the encore.
