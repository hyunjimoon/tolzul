**Stream 1: Newsvendor Extensions (40%)**

- Classic: Arrow et al. (1951), Porteus (2002) foundations
- Time-sensitive: Weatherford & Bodily (1992) perishable newsvendor
- Quality-based: Xu & Lu (2013) quality-dependent demand
- Gap: "No model captures quality choice under bilateral commitment uncertainty"

**Stream 2: Commitment & Timing Models (30%)**

- Search theory: McCall (1970), Weitzman (1979) optimal stopping
- Matching models: Roth & Sotomayor (1990) two-sided uncertainty
- Platform commitment: Rochet & Tirole (2006) timing in two-sided markets
- Gap: "Assume commitment probabilities are exogenous, not quality-driven"
****
**Stream 3: Asymmetric Cost Models (20%)**

- Mismatch costs: Cachon & Lariviere (1999) supply chain coordination
- Service levels: Van Mieghem (2003) asymmetric service costs
- Gap: "Focus on quantity mismatches, not quality-induced mismatches"

**Integration Paragraph (10%)**

- "We synthesize these streams by modeling quality as the decision variable that endogenously determines bilateral commitment probabilities under time pressure"
- Position as "natural next step" in newsvendor evolution
