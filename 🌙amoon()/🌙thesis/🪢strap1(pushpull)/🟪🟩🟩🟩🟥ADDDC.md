# **Degeneracy: From Bug to Feature Explained**

# WHAT:
Entrepreneurial problems are _fundamentally degenerate_: new opportunities explode the ratio of decision variables to constraints so classical optimisation fails. Flexible Bayesian modelling reframes this “bug” as a _feature_, turning vast possibility spaces into strategic advantage. Recognising degeneracy creates three sequential needs: **(i)** prioritise which stakeholder’s randomness to rein (D0), **(ii)** predict commitment parameters β (D1), and **(iii)** prescribe quality q (D2). Meeting all three simultaneously motivates a _unified prediction‑prescription_ model (C1) that jointly chooses (q, β) instead of treating learning and action as separate phases.

Entrepreneurial success in novel markets requires navigating a "degenerate" decision space, where choices vastly outnumber constraints. This challenge is intensified by the perishable nature of stakeholder commitment, demanding a framework that integrates learning (prediction) and action (prescription) to avoid both analysis paralysis and premature commitment.
