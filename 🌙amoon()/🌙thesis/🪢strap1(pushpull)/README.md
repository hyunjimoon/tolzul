# STRAP1 (Push-Pull) Module Structure

| Module | Title | Key Insight | Relation |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| [[🟪A0]] | **Entrepreneurial Stakeholder Prioritization is Degenerate** | Entrepreneurial stakeholder prioritization exhibits degeneracy: large variable count, small constraint count (spanning all movements) | foundational to → [[🟪A1]], [[🟪A2]], [[🟥C1]] |
| [[🟪A1]] | **New Opportunities Increase var#/cstr#** | New opportunities exponentially increase decision variables relative to constraints | from [[🟪A0]]; develops → [[🟩D0]] |
| [[🟪A2]] | **Moving Fast Increases var#/cstr#** | Faster market clockspeed reduces constraint stability, increasing degeneracy | from [[🟪A0]]; develops → [[🟩D0']] |
| [[🟩D0]] | **Need to Prioritize Stakeholder** | Stakeholder theories and main randomness sources for each stakeholders | from [[🟪A1]]; branches to → [[🟩D1]], [[🟩D2]] |
| [[🟩D1]] | **Need to Predict Stakeholder Commitment** | Random utility models predict commitment given stakeholders | from [[🟩D0]]; contributes to → [[🟥C1]] |
| [[🟩D2]] | **Need to Prescribe Quality Assuming Commitments** | News vendor model prescribe preparation given predicted randomness | from [[🟩D0]]; contributes to → [[🟥C1]] |
| [[🟥C1]] | **Cast Stakeholder Prioritization as Unified Prediction-Prescription Model** | Prediction-prescription decision model integrates commitment prediction with quality optimization | from [[🟩D1]] + [[🟩D2]]; validated by → [[🟥C2]] |
| [[🟧G0]] | **Optimize Quality Given Stakeholders Linear** | High quality if 1) overage ≫ underage cost, 2) high V & Co < Cu OR low V & Co > Cu | mathematical foundation for → [[🟧G1]] |
| [[🟧G1]] | **Commitments are Quality-Nonlinear** | Optimal quality when marginal (cost + benefit) = 0 for increasing quality | from [[🟧G0]]; develops → [[🟧G2]] |
| [[🟧G2]] | **Commitments are Quality-Nonlinear and Asymmetric** | Opt. quality when marginal (cost + benefit) = 0 for q inc.[PRIMAL] opt. response coef. βr, βc when marginal (cost + benefit) = 0 for q inc.[DUAL] | from [[🟧G1]]; contributes to → [[🟥C2]] |
| [[🗄️eff_prof_eff_acc(p,p,pp)]] | **Failure Mode of Prediction w/o Prescription** | Shows why prediction-only approaches fail in entrepreneurial contexts | demonstrates need for → [[🟥C2]] |
| [[🖼️eff_prof_eff_acc(p,p,pp)]] | **Failure Mode of Prescription w/o Prediction** | Shows why prescription-only approaches fail without stakeholder commitment models | demonstrates need for → [[🟥C2]] |
| [[🟥C2]] | **Integrated is More Robust and Efficient** | Integrated prediction-prescription outperforms separated approaches | from [[🟧G2]] + failure modes; supports → [[🟥C1]] |
| [[🟥C0]] | **Flexible Bayes Modeling** | Bayesian framework enables flexible modeling of uncertainty | methodological foundation for → [[🟥C1]], [[🟥C2]] |
| [[🟩D0']] | **Need to Control Clockspeed** | G0' clockspeed, pull/agile/flexibility model | from [[🟪A2]]; branches to → [[🟩D1']], [[🟩D2']] |
| [[🟩D1']] | **Learn β then Bet** | G1' - inferring βr, βc - pull | from [[🟩D0']]; contributes to → [[🟥C1']] |
| [[🟩D2']] | **Bet q then Learn β** | G2' - effectuation - push | from [[🟩D0']]; contributes to → [[🟥C1']] |
| [[🟥C1']] | **Interpret Push and Pull to Propose Push-Pull** | Push-pull (jointly optimize q, rp, c) proves supremacy - converges to same optimal solution more robustly and efficiently | from [[🟩D1']] + [[🟩D2']]; synthesizes entire framework |

## Core Innovation
**Optimizing the priority of stakeholders and one's own quality simultaneously** - treating both as random variables within an integrated framework rather than fixing one to optimize the other.
