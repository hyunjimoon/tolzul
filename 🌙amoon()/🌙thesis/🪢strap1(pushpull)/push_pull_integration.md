# Push-Pull Integration for Stakeholder Prioritization

## Three Approaches Mapped to Push-Pull

1. **Prescription-Major** = Push Strategy (D2')
   - Start with quality optimization based on assumed β
   - "Push" optimal q to market

2. **Prediction-Major** = Pull Strategy (D1')
   - Start with market observation to learn β
   - "Pull" quality decisions from actual demand

3. **Integrated** = Dynamic Push-Pull
   - Simultaneously optimize q and learn β
   - Cycle time τ determines the balance

## Key Insight from push_pull().md
"Neither pure push nor pure pull is optimal" - the best strategy combines both, with the balance determined by:
- Market uncertainty
- Economies of scale  
- Cycle time capabilities

## Simple Decision Rule
- High uncertainty + Fast cycles → Use D1' (Pull)
- Low uncertainty + Scale needs → Use D2' (Push)
- Mixed conditions → Control τ in D0'
