# ðŸŸ§G12: Mathematical Methods Framework

## ðŸŸ§G1: Linear Quality Model

The linear model transforms the classical newsvendor by making quality $q \in [0,1]$ the decision variable. Stakeholder responses are linear and opposing:
- Customer commitment probability: $P_c(q) = q$ (increases with quality)
- Resource partner commitment probability: $P_r(q) = 1-q$ (decreases with quality)

This creates four outcomes with probabilities:
- Both commit: $P_c \cdot P_r = q(1-q)$ â†’ Value $V$
- Customer only: $P_c(1-P_r) = q^2$ â†’ Underage cost $C_u$
- Partner only: $P_r(1-P_c) = (1-q)^2$ â†’ Overage cost $C_o$
- Neither: $(1-P_c)(1-P_r) = 0$ â†’ No cost

**Optimal quality:** $q^* = \frac{V+2C_o}{2(C_u+C_o+V)}$

**Key insight:** The "cost-priority principle" - quality adjusts to avoid the more expensive mismatch. When overage is costly ($C_o > C_u$), increase quality. When underage is costly ($C_u > C_o$), decrease quality.

## ðŸŸ§G2: Sigmoid Quality Model  

The sigmoid model captures realistic S-shaped stakeholder responses:
- Customer: $P_c(q) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_c q}}$
- Partner: $P_r(q) = \frac{1}{1+e^{\beta_r q}}$

For the symmetric case ($\beta_c = 1, \beta_r = -1$):

**Optimal quality:** $q^* = \ln\left(\frac{2C_o + V}{2C_u + V}\right)$

**Key insights:**
1. **Symmetric responsiveness:** When both stakeholders respond equally, balance net penalties
2. **Asymmetric responsiveness:** When one stakeholder is more sensitive ($\beta_c \gg \beta_r$), their preferences dominate
3. **High match value:** When $V \gg C_u, C_o$, maximize joint commitment probability

## Comparison: ðŸŸ§G1 vs ðŸŸ§G2

|Aspect|Linear (G1)|Sigmoid (G2)|
|---|---|---|
|Response curves|Linear opposing|S-shaped realistic|
|Solution|Always closed-form|Closed-form for special cases|
|Cost-priority|Pure cost ratios|Moderated by responsiveness Î²|
|Business insight|Simple trade-offs|Behavioral steepness matters|

Both models demonstrate how quality decisions must balance opposing stakeholder preferences, but G2's sigmoid functions capture the diminishing returns and saturation effects observed in real markets.
