# 🟥C2: Integrated is Effective, Efficient, Profitable

Comprehensive analysis across three model specifications demonstrates the decisive superiority of integrated prediction-prescription approaches in environments with perishable commitment. Using Tesla's parameters (βr<<βc reflecting battery partners' limited quality elasticity versus customers' high sensitivity), we compare performance across five critical metrics. 

**Prescription effectiveness** reveals the integrated approach's unique ability to always reach global optimum q*, while pure prediction fails by keeping quality fixed at 0 (missing the market entirely) and pure prescription fails in asymmetric markets by targeting wrong optima—prescribing q*=ln(3/2)≈0.405 when true optimum is q*=ln(4)≈1.386 for Tesla's customer-dominant market.

**Prescription profitability** quantifies the cost of these failures: with Cu=1, Co=V=2, integrated approaches achieve expected cost at optimal q*=ln(4), while prescription approaches suffer from misalignment costs at suboptimal q*=ln(3/2), and prediction approaches incur maximum costs by never optimizing quality. Tesla's success hinged on this difference—finding the quality level that balanced customer acquisition with partner feasibility, not just guessing based on symmetric assumptions.

**Prediction accuracy** exposes a crucial trade-off: pure prediction achieves 100% parameter learning but zero quality optimization (perfect knowledge, no action), while integrated approaches accept 50% accuracy in asymmetric cases by learning only relevant parameters. Tesla didn't need to perfectly understand battery partner elasticity (low βr) once they recognized customer response dominated—this selective learning enabled faster convergence to optimal quality.

**Prediction effectiveness** becomes infinite for prescription approaches (no learning needed) and integrated approaches (reaching exact optimum), while pure prediction shows finite effectiveness since quality remains suboptimal despite parameter learning. **Update efficiency** reveals how integrated approaches achieve superior return on learning investment by exploiting problem structure—focusing effort on parameters that actually constrain outcomes rather than blindly learning everything.

The performance gaps prove especially stark in degenerate environments where time pressure and parameter uncertainty combine. Integrated approaches converge robustly even when initial assumptions are wrong, while pure strategies either miss opportunities (prediction) or miss the market (prescription). Tesla's push-pull execution—launching bold designs while rapidly incorporating feedback—exemplifies how integration enables entrepreneurs to navigate perishable commitment successfully, achieving what neither careful analysis nor bold action alone could accomplish.

## Parameter Space Analysis

### **G1 Panel (Symmetric Case: βr = βc = β)**

In the symmetric responsiveness case where resource partners and customers exhibit equal sensitivity to quality (βr = βc = β), the parameter space collapses to two dimensions (q, β). The 🟦 **Prediction (Dual)** approach moves vertically from (0,1) to (0,2), achieving high **prediction accuracy** by correctly learning β=2, but suffers from zero **prescription effectiveness** as it remains stuck at q=0, unable to leverage its knowledge. The 🟫 **Prescription (Primal)** approach moves horizontally from (0,1) to (ln(3/2),1), achieving moderate **prescription effectiveness** by reaching the newsvendor-optimal q* for its assumed β=1, but with poor **prescription profitability** due to using incorrect responsiveness parameters. The 🟥 **Integrated** approach moves diagonally from (0,1) to (ln(3/2),2), simultaneously achieving both high **prediction effectiveness** (correctly learning β=2) and optimal **prescription effectiveness** (reaching the true optimal q*), while demonstrating superior **update efficiency** by converging along the optimal curve q* = 1/β ln((2Co+V)/(2Cu+V)) rather than requiring sequential steps.

### **G2 Panel (Asymmetric Case: βr << βc)**

In the asymmetric case where resource partner responsiveness dominates (βr << βc), the full three-dimensional parameter space reveals how different approaches handle complexity. The 🟦 **Prediction (Dual)** approach moves from (0,1,1) to (0,2,5), achieving high **prediction accuracy** for both parameters but wasting computational resources learning the irrelevant βc=5, resulting in poor **update efficiency** and zero **prescription effectiveness**. The 🟫 **Prescription (Primal)** approach moves from (0,1,1) to (ln(4),1,1), reaching a suboptimal q* based on incorrect β assumptions, yielding moderate **prescription effectiveness** but potentially catastrophic **prescription profitability** when the true βr=2 differs substantially from the assumed βr=1. The 🟥 **Integrated** approach demonstrates intelligent dimensional reduction by moving from (0,1,1) to (ln(4),2,1), anchoring βc=1 upon recognizing its minimal impact, achieving optimal **prescription effectiveness** while maximizing **update efficiency** through selective learning - it ignores the irrelevant βc dimension and focuses computational resources on the critical βr parameter, converging along the reduced-dimension optimal surface q* = 1/βr ln((Co+V)/Cu).
