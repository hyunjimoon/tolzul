1. attached is two diagrams for G1: beta_r = beta_c = beta, G2: beta_r << beta_c situation. it compares the reaction of three, given the parameters update from 1. G1: beta_r = beta_c = beta: (q, beta) = (0,1,1) -> (?, 2,2) 1. 🟦(0,2,2) for prediction-only (stay on q = 0 hyperplane) 2. 🟫(ln(3/2), 1,1) for prescription-only (stay on (beta_r, beta_c) = (1,1) hyperplane AND optimal hyperplane (q = 1/beta_r ln ((Co+V)/Cu)) 3. 🟥(1/2 ln(3/2), 2,2) for integrated (⭐️stay on (q, beta) optimal hyperplane (q = 1/beta ln ((2Co+V)/2Cu+V)) 2.

2. attached screenshot shows this. i'd like you to reproduce them to show TWO MAIN effects: 1. staying on (q,beta) optimality plane. can be observed in both 1. G1 as 🟫 and 🟥 are on q* = 1/beta ln ((2 Co + V)/(2 Cu + V)) 2. G2 as 🟫 and 🟥 are on q* = 1/beta_r ln(Co + V/ Cu) 2. anchoring on beta_c = 1 can be observed in 1. G2 as 🟫 are on beta_c = 1 3.
    
3. i'd love if you could have some connection with the attached formulation of 🟫 (prescription which fixes beta as primal) and 🟦(prediction which fixes q as dual) and 🟥 (which jointly optimizes q and beta)

# 🟥C2: Integrated is Effective, Efficient, Profitable

Comprehensive analysis across three model specifications demonstrates the decisive superiority of integrated prediction-prescription approaches in environments with perishable commitment. Using Tesla's parameters (βr<<βc reflecting battery partners' limited quality elasticity versus customers' high sensitivity), we compare performance across five critical metrics. **Prescription effectiveness** reveals the integrated approach's unique ability to always reach global optimum q*, while pure prediction fails by keeping quality fixed at 0 (missing the market entirely) and pure prescription fails in asymmetric markets by targeting wrong optima—prescribing q*=ln(3/2)≈0.405 when true optimum is q*=ln(4)≈1.386 for Tesla's customer-dominant market.

**Prescription profitability** quantifies the cost of these failures: with Cu=1, Co=V=2, integrated approaches achieve expected cost at optimal q*=ln(4), while prescription approaches suffer from misalignment costs at suboptimal q*=ln(3/2), and prediction approaches incur maximum costs by never optimizing quality. Tesla's success hinged on this difference—finding the quality level that balanced customer acquisition with partner feasibility, not just guessing based on symmetric assumptions.

**Prediction accuracy** exposes a crucial trade-off: pure prediction achieves 100% parameter learning but zero quality optimization (perfect knowledge, no action), while integrated approaches accept 50% accuracy in asymmetric cases by learning only relevant parameters. Tesla didn't need to perfectly understand battery partner elasticity (low βr) once they recognized customer response dominated—this selective learning enabled faster convergence to optimal quality.

**Prediction effectiveness** becomes infinite for prescription approaches (no learning needed) and integrated approaches (reaching exact optimum), while pure prediction shows finite effectiveness since quality remains suboptimal despite parameter learning. **Update efficiency** reveals how integrated approaches achieve superior return on learning investment by exploiting problem structure—focusing effort on parameters that actually constrain outcomes rather than blindly learning everything.

The performance gaps prove especially stark in degenerate environments where time pressure and parameter uncertainty combine. Integrated approaches converge robustly even when initial assumptions are wrong, while pure strategies either miss opportunities (prediction) or miss the market (prescription). Tesla's push-pull execution—launching bold designs while rapidly incorporating feedback—exemplifies how integration enables entrepreneurs to navigate perishable commitment successfully, achieving what neither careful analysis nor bold action alone could accomplish.
