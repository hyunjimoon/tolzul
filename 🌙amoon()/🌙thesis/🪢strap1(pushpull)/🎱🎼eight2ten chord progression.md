| 1    | 🟪A0 → 🟪A1, 🟪A2         | Exposition: Entrepreneurial decisions are structurally degenerate (A0), a problem exacerbated by conflicting stakeholder views (A1: Different Maps) and rhythms (A2: Different Clocks).               |
| 2    | 🟪A1 → 🟩D1, 🟪A2 → 🟩D2  | Development: These factors create a false choice: a static "learn-or-act" dilemma (D1), which evolves into a set of inefficient sequential strategies like "learn then act" in the dynamic case (D2). |
| 3    | 🟥C1 → 🟥C2 → 🟥C0        | Theme: This paper's contribution is a robust framework (C0) that resolves this dilemma through effective (C1) and efficient (C2) integrated strategies.                                               |
|      |                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4    | 🟩D1 → 🟧G1 → 🟥C1        | Var. 1 (Effectiveness): A linear model with one variable (q) shows the integrated approach reaches the global optimum while separated approaches do not.                                              |
| 5    | 🟩D1 → 🟧G1.5 → 🟥C1      | Var. 2 (Effectiveness): An asymmetric linear model with two variables (q, β) confirms the effectiveness of the integrated approach.                                                                   |
| 6    | 🟩D2 → 🟧G2 → 🟥C2        | Var. 3 (Efficiency): A nonlinear model (q, β) shows the integrated approach is more efficient due to shorter travel distance (dimensional reduction) and no need for costly stopping rules.           |
| 7    | C0 → G' → D'<br>🟧G → 🟪A | Var. 4 (Robustness): The integrated principle (C0) is shown to be robust against a flawed or changing model (G'), causing separated approaches to fail (D').                                          |

| 8    | 🟥C1 & 🟥C2 Results       | Crescendo & Fortissimo: Quantitative results prove the integrated approach is both more effective (lower cost) and more efficient (faster convergence).                                               |
| 9    | 🟪A0 → 🟩D0 → 🟧G0 → 🟥C0 | Resolution: The complete framework transforms degeneracy from a bug into a feature, leveraging flexibility for adaptive advantage.                                                                    |
| 10   | 🟥C0 →🟪A0                | Coda: The core solution (C0) illuminates how to solve the broader "shell" of the degenerate problem (A0) in other complex domains.                                                                    |


The composition follows a classical structure where the problem (A) motivates approaches (D), which are operationalized through models (G), leading to solutions (C). The three variations (lines 4-6) progressively build complexity from linear to nonlinear, static to dynamic, showing how the integrated approach consistently outperforms separated strategies.
