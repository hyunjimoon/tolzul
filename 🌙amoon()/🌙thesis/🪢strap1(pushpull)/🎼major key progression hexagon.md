| 1    | ðŸŸªA0â†’ðŸŸªA1â†’ðŸŸªA2            | **Exposition**: Entrepreneurial decisions are degenerate because (1) stakeholders have different priors and (2) operate on different clockspeeds                              |
| 2    | ðŸŸªA1â†’ðŸŸ©D1, ðŸŸªA2â†’ðŸŸ©D2      | **Development**: These degeneracy factors create tensions - static prior differences lead to learn-or-act dilemma, dynamic clockspeed differences lead to pull-or-push choice |

The composition follows a classical structure where the problem (A) motivates approaches (D), which are operationalized through models (G), leading to solutions (C). The three variations (lines 4-6) progressively build complexity from linear to nonlinear, static to dynamic, showing how the integrated approach consistently outperforms separated strategies.
