# D2' Push Strategy: Bet q then Learn β

## Core Principle
Optimize quality based on forecasted stakeholder parameters, then learn from market response.

## Key Characteristics
- **Information flow**: Forecast β → q* → Market response
- **Trigger**: Planning cycles and forecasts
- **Example**: Traditional MRP - produce based on demand forecast

## Mathematical Sequence
1. Assume β parameters based on forecast/experience
2. Optimize q* = argmin E[C(q|β_forecast)]
3. Deploy q and observe actual responses
4. Update β beliefs for next cycle

## When to Use
- Stable, predictable demand
- High economies of scale
- Long production lead times
- When inventory holding is acceptable
