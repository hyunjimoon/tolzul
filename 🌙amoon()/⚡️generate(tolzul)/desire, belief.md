| Spring 2023           | Integer Optimization (15.083)  | Desire: To understand how entrepreneurs make decisions systematically | Belief shifted: Realized complex decisions can be decomposed into manageable optimization problems         | Prof.Alex Jacquiliat<br>Through optimization techniques, saw how entrepreneurial experimentation could be structured as sub-problems rather than one big decision |
| Spring 2023 - Present | Thesis Graduate (THG)          | Desire: To connect theories with practical entrepreneurship           | Evolution: Started seeing exchangeability as key to understanding how entrepreneurs classify opportunities | Prof.Charles Fine<br>Discussions revealed how patterns in entrepreneurial learning could be formalized through Bayesian frameworks                                |
| Fall 2023             | Microeconomic Theory (API-111) | Desire: To understand economic decision theory                        | New belief: Subjective beliefs fundamentally affect action timing (clockspeed)                             | Prof.Luis Armona<br>Professor's computational Bayesian approach showed how theory could become practical tools                                                    |

| Spring 2024           | Transportation (1.200)         | Desire: To learn network optimization                                 | New understanding: Experiments aren't isolated but form networks of learning                               | Prof.Cathy Wu<br>Connected network theory to how entrepreneurs navigate possibility spaces                                                                        |
| Fall 2024 (Planned)   | Comp. Cognitive Science (9.66) | Current desire: To formalize mental models                            | Anticipated evolution: Better tools for modeling how entrepreneurs update beliefs                          | Prof.Josh Tenenbaum<br>Seeking to connect cognitive science tools with Bayesian inference                                                                         |

The transcript particularly reveals this evolution through statements like:
- Early focus: "like I said last time, without some very concrete structure of a mathematics, it's hard to start something"
- Middle stage: "But this semester, I discovered, as I discovered just cognitive science, I discovered there is always also a distance between them"
- Current synthesis: "I think I converge to things like sampling. Sampling algorithm is one area where Bayesian statistics and cognitive science can provide some theoretical judgments"

This shows how your thinking evolved from seeking mathematical structure to appreciating cognitive frameworks, finally synthesizing both in your approach to sampling problems.
