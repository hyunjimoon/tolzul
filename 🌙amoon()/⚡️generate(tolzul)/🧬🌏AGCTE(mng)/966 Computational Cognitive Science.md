- mcmc as metaphor and cognitive theory 
- calculate stationary dist. from transition matrix (eigen vacecture; convergence rate - how long it takes to reach); posterior dist is stationary (state as latent variable or hypothesis; approximate p(h|D) interesting intuitive easy to set up local dynamics)
- when metropolis hastings? p(data|h) and p(h), but 
- suppose wew can compute likelihood and prior but not the sum over h needed for posterior
- relation btw sampling and density evaluation  (dan roy, cameron)
- T(h_t+1|h_t) is function of proposal (inner loop) and acceptance distribution (outerloop) - outerloop is tabular ; moving around (latent variables; hypothesis as "choices of prog" then "trace of the program to evaluate any one sample program") - don't accept every proposal
- new hypothesis explains the data better, we're accepting it
- proposal is asymmetric (esp. when hyopthesis is more structured)
- two classes of complicated vs simple hypothesis ()
- detailed balance: have transtiontion kernel with pi_i (if for all hypothesis ); overall time (all the hypothesis to the other), twice the prob. on state i than state j, whatever acceptance (rate lambda); the way webppl initialize is empirical bayes "initialization right, or just to initialize with some with basically a program trace that does evaluate the data or with some reasonable probability."
- burnin: doesn't matter where you start, once the two chains cross from different initial points
-
- mixing: luckily unlucky (go down alley) then luckily lucky (go up in a lower mountain)

ideas of mcmc
generate data (fits avg of data)
lots of samples and choose median for the answer (no convergence going on within one person's head)
don't wait like statistian; across different settings -> collect ppl's -> posterior predictive dist.
posterior from one expression?
graded behavior as symbolic process

Let me help break this down systematically.

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE:
This section bridges the theoretical foundation of exchangeability with its practical application through hierarchical learning. It's crucial because it:
1. Transforms abstract probability concepts into concrete innovation strategies
2. Shows how hierarchical Bayesian frameworks enable structured learning under uncertainty
3. Connects early explorative decisions to later exploitation phases

From Josh's teaching strategy in üß†9.66, I notice he:
1. Always starts with concrete examples before abstract concepts
2. Uses parallel structures (what we see vs underlying mechanism)
3. Shows how simpler concepts build up to complex frameworks
4. Maintains consistent examples throughout different levels of abstraction

Let me help shape this for Josh Tenenbaum's class, focusing on what would resonate based on his interests and teaching style.






# Current Paper Analysis vs Josh's Interests

## Core Alignment Points
1. **Sampling & Decision Making**
   - Josh's emphasis: Optimal sample size for decisions (one-and-done)
   - Current paper: Parallel sampling in innovation contexts
   - Opportunity: Frame innovation as optimal sampling under uncertainty

2. **Hierarchical Bayesian Models**
   - Josh's focus: Structured learning, concept formation
   - Current paper: Hierarchical learning in business contexts
   - Opportunity: Strengthen mathematical formalization

3. **Cognitive Architecture**
   - Josh's interest: How minds make quick, effective decisions
   - Current paper: How organizations make strategic choices
   - Opportunity: Frame as cognitive model of entrepreneurial decision-making

## Key Changes Needed

1. **Computational Model**
   - Current: Descriptive statistics and basic probability
   - Needed: Formal model of sampling and decision-making
   - Implementation: Extend Vul's framework with exchangeability

2. **Experimental Validation**
   - Current: Case studies only
   - Needed: Behavioral experiments/simulations
   - Implementation: Add Monte Carlo simulations

3. **Format & Length**
   - Current: Full paper (30+ pages)
   - Needed: 6-page conference format
   - Implementation: Focus on model and results

## Proposed Structure (6 pages)

1. Introduction (1 page)
   - Frame as extending One-and-Done to organizational decisions
   - Focus on sampling under uncertainty

2. Model (2 pages)
   - Formal definition of exchangeability structures
   - Extended sampling equations
   - Decision time analysis

3. Experiments (2 pages)
   - Monte Carlo simulations
   - Comparison with human data
   - Visualization of results

4. Discussion & Conclusion (1 page)
   - Theoretical implications
   - Practical applications
   - Future work



Now, let me propose the specific revisions using the requested format:

| Section | Current | Proposed | Key Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Model Foundation | Section 2: Long discussion of exaptation and evolution | "We extend Vul et al.'s one-and-done framework to parallel sampling, introducing exchangeability as a key parameter. Consider an agent deciding between multiple innovation paths..." | Directly builds on Josh's work, focuses on computational model |
| 2. Core Framework | Section 3: Descriptive discussion of horizons | "The optimal number of parallel samples k* depends on both time cost r and exchangeability Œµ: k* = argmax R(k,r,Œµ) where R is the rate of utility gain..." | Adds formal mathematical model |
| 3. Examples | Multiple case studies scattered throughout | One focused example of Tesla's battery development, used consistently to illustrate model predictions | Creates coherent narrative for model testing |

Based on this analysis, here are three concrete action items:

1. RESTRUCTURE THE PAPER
   - Remove evolutionary biology framework
   - Start with Vul's model as foundation
   - Focus on mathematical formalization of parallel sampling

2. ADD COMPUTATIONAL VALIDATION
   - Implement Monte Carlo simulations
   - Compare different exchangeability structures 
   - Visualize decision boundaries

3. TIGHTEN NARRATIVE
   - Use single consistent example (Tesla)
   - Frame as cognitive model of innovation
   - Cut to 6 pages

Here's the fixed formatting:

| fig:horizon_ratio      | Hierarchy of opportunity and Sampling-Decision Processes. The left matrix maps innovation opportunities across existing/new needs (vertical axis) and existing/new solutions (horizontal axis), creating four quadrants with increasing levels of uncertainty (1-3). The right panels illustrate corresponding decision processes: (top) infinite exploration in high uncertainty environments (horizon 3), (middle) iterative sampling with revision possibility (horizon 3)), and (bottom) direct path from options which decides without the need for sampling. Background colors indicate uncertainty levels: gray for known domains, coral for new solutions, blue for new needs, and darker gray for highest uncertainty. This mapping shows how decision complexity increases with uncertainty level, from direct paths in quadrant 1 to iterative processes in quadrants 2 and extensive exploration in quadrant 3. |

Three suggestions for adapting existing figures/tables:

1. Simplify fig:evol2horizon to focus only on uncertainty levels and sampling strategies, removing evolutionary terminology

2. Modify fig:horizon_ratio to emphasize sampling processes:
   - Left panel: Different sampling regimes
   - Right panel: Decision quality vs sample size

3. Update tab:hierarchical_learning_simplified to:
   - Remove entrepreneurship analogies
   - Focus on sampling equations
   - Add new Monte Carlo simulation results

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or suggest specific modifications to the figures?
