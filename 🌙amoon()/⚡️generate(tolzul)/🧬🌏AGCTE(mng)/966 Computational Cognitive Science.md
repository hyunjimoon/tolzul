- mcmc as metaphor and cognitive theory 
- calculate stationary dist. from transition matrix (eigen vacecture; convergence rate - how long it takes to reach); posterior dist is stationary (state as latent variable or hypothesis; approximate p(h|D) interesting intuitive easy to set up local dynamics)
- when metropolis hastings? p(data|h) and p(h), but 
- suppose wew can compute likelihood and prior but not the sum over h needed for posterior
- relation btw sampling and density evaluation  (dan roy, cameron)
- T(h_t+1|h_t) is function of proposal (inner loop) and acceptance distribution (outerloop) - outerloop is tabular ; moving around (latent variables; hypothesis as "choices of prog" then "trace of the program to evaluate any one sample program") - don't accept every proposal
- new hypothesis explains the data better, we're accepting it
- proposal is asymmetric (esp. when hyopthesis is more structured)
- two classes of complicated vs simple hypothesis ()
- detailed balance: have transtiontion kernel with pi_i (if for all hypothesis ); overall time (all the hypothesis to the other), twice the prob. on state i than state j, whatever acceptance (rate lambda); the way webppl initialize is empirical bayes "initialization right, or just to initialize with some with basically a program trace that does evaluate the data or with some reasonable probability."
- burnin: doesn't matter where you start, once the two chains cross from different initial points
-
- mixing: luckily unlucky (go down alley) then luckily lucky (go up in a lower mountain)

ideas of mcmc
generate data (fits avg of data)
lots of samples and choose median for the answer (no convergence going on within one person's head)
don't wait like statistian; across different settings -> collect ppl's -> posterior predictive dist.
posterior from one expression?
graded behavior as symbolic process
