| **Angus (1997)**(\emph{The Inspection Paradox Inequality})                     | Demonstrates rigorously, via a renewal process, that the interval in which a specific observation time falls is stochastically larger than the ‚Äútypical‚Äù interval. Proves a ‚Äúbias‚Äù arises when you measure a system by sampling at a random time (rather than sampling intervals directly).      | Establishes a foundational mathematical proof of why intervals ‚Äúinspected‚Äù from within can appear longer than intervals measured externally, thus clarifying the nature of the inspection paradox.                                              |
| **Ross (2003)**(\emph{The Inspection Paradox})<br>                             | Extends the concept by showing how, in renewal processes, a point chosen within an interval sees that interval as stochastically larger; also provides likelihood-ratio arguments. Illustrates the effect with real-life analogies, such as a random ‚Äúsample‚Äù child belonging to a large family. | Reinforces that the viewpoint of an \emph{insider} systematically differs from an \emph{outside} vantage (e.g., how a passenger views wait times vs. the system operator). This mismatch underlies many real-world ‚Äúmeasurement‚Äù discrepancies. |
| **Downey (various examples, 2019‚Äì2021)**(\emph{Towards Data Science} articles) | Shows the paradox in practical settings: e.g., students over-reporting large class sizes, waiting times for public transport being longer than official schedules suggest, or friendship networks appearing more connected than they really are.                                                 | Demonstrates that measuring from users‚Äô ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù can yield systematically different results than aggregate/system-level observations.

inspection #paradox: Bus arrives at the stop every EX time on average, but the expected waiting time of prospective riders is larger than EX/2. Smaller the variance, smaller the gap (between local agent‚Äôs and global agent‚Äôs average) becomes. Inspection paradox happens when the probability of observing a quantity is related to the quantity being observed. This paradox can shed light on the degree of similarity between internal and external or local and global agent. To be specific, the more EV deviates from EX/2, EX (for $\sigma_x^2 = (EX)^2$) to sometimes larger than EX (for Bern(1, p) with p<.5), the larger the gap between time then space average ($\int$ dTdS) vs space then time average ($\int$ dSdT). (i.e. we can't apply Fubini theorem)
Ultimately, I'd use the result to understand "Perception Gap between Internal Actor and External Evaluator" whose mechanism is explained in [[15_357_proposal_MoonZhang.pdf]].  

The probability of observing misalignment is related to the observed misalignment. The more misaligned two evaluators are, it's easier to mutually identify differences. It‚Äôs because each evaluator has evaluation measure uncertainty (i.e.¬† doubt about their rulers üìè at hand hence ruler uncertainty). What may be "aligned close enough" with current rulers may change to misaligned with finer rulers. Hence, the more misaligned the two are, the higher the probability of observing misalignment.

| Chapter | Main Concept | Application to Angie's Situation |
|---------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Importance Sampling to SMC | Using weighted samples to approximate target distributions, with resampling to address weight degeneracy in sequential settings | Angie could use SMC to track the evolution of ideas/approaches in probabilistic programming over time, using the nine experts as "particles" and resampling based on how influential their ideas become |
| Learning Proposals and Twisting Targets | Adapting proposal distributions and intermediate target distributions to improve SMC performance | Angie could learn proposal distributions for predicting each expert's next contribution based on their past work. She could also design intermediate targets that incorporate information about future developments to guide the sampling |
| Nested Monte Carlo | Using layers of Monte Carlo sampling to approximate intractable ideal algorithms | Angie could use nested MC to handle uncertainty at multiple levels - e.g. uncertainty in each expert's contributions nested within uncertainty about overall field directions |
| Conditional SMC | Conditioning SMC on a reference trajectory to construct MCMC algorithms targeting the original distribution | Angie could use conditional SMC to explore alternative histories of probabilistic programming development, conditioning on the actual observed trajectory but allowing variations to study counterfactuals |
