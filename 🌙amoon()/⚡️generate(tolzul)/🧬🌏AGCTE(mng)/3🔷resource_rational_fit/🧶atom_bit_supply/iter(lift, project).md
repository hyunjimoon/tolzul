title: "Clever Lifting"
date: "2021-08-08"
---

My question began from how and where could the idea of lifting or augmentation be used cleverly like HMC? Adding the momentum variable helps structured sampling in HMC. I listed concepts that I thought could connect; the first part of this post describes a static relationship created by lifting between the original (q) and its new coordinate (q,p). The second part lists how this relation could be developed into a converging process through "lift then project" iteration. The third part plans to present how the second strategy be used in optimization and verification. 

## 1. Relation created by lifting  

Origin X $\xrightarrow{Lift \;  f}$ Augmented (X, f(X))

- newly created structure as the following on augmented space prompts 2 below i.e. efficient update.
    - Convex structure through dual variable: Lagrangian-related
    - Vector flow structure through dual variable: HMC, Augmented neural ODE
    - Markov structure through extra state: CVaR MDP, Stopping time
    - Sampling structure through latent var: EM, Imputation
    - Efficiency and diversity through copy: Coupling, Splitting

## 2\. Lift then project iteration

Origin $X_t \underset{\text { Lift }}{\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}}$  Augmented $(X_t, f(X_t))$ $\underset{\text { Project }}{\stackrel{f^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}}$ $X_{t+1}$

- used for efficient update (~ calibration) or verification via model boostrap
- verification is my aim developing on attractor idea in [_coupling, copula, calibration_](https://hackmd.io/jYRJ0fBCQZOjhtPU5Pq65w#coupling-copula-calibration)
- similar to Source ($X_t, P$) $\rightarrow\[\\text{Compress}\]{f}$ Aug. $(X\_t, f(X\_t)) \\xrightarrow\[\\text{Decompress}\]{P(X\_{t+1}|f(X\_t))}$ Receiver $X\_{t+1}$?

Quotes from papers

- combining the augmented Lagrangian approach with MCMC sampling to generate a point in the proximity of the global optimum of the GRB problem. sample points with a higher objective function value and simultaneously drive the sample path in the direction of the feasible region using the augmented Lagrangian terms. - [A generalized risk budgeting approach to portfolio construction](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2078/A_generalized_risk_budgeting_approach.pdf)
- by introducing an extra state variable, an optimal policy can be sufficiently characterized as a Markov process defined on this augmented state space. - Min's [paper](http://www.mskyt.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cvar-exec.pdf)
- augment the known preferences (6.22) with the inequality u(ak) ≤ u(al). If augmented set of preferences is infeasible, it means that any concave nondecreasing utility function that is consistent with the original given consumer preference data must also satisfy u(ak) > u(al); conclude that basket k is preferred to basket l, without knowing the underlying utility function. - Boyd's convex optimization textbook p.341

Q1. From the quote in Boyd's textbook, it seems the role of "Augmented preference" is feasibility certificate, but its role is tricky to understand. Especially does 'augment' mean sampling in this context?

Q2. Could there be any relationship between splitting and coupling? Do you agree they have similar flavor; the only difference being the direction of the bifurcation --= vs =--?

Here are some related references that I am going through:

## 4. Information Relaxation (Brown, Smith and Sun, 2010)
What if we relax the “information constraint”?
• a.k.a. non-anticipativity constraint: DM can only use the information revealed so far
• allow DM to access some future information
• introduce penalties for violating the constraint
The relaxed DP problem
• yields a performance bound on the maximal achievable performance
• can be easier to solve than the original DP problem more future information
The idea has been studied in different contexts:
• Rockafellar and Wets (1991) – stochastic programming
• Davis and Karatzas (1994) – optimal stopping
• Rogers (2002), Haugh and Kogan (2004), Anderson and Broadie (2004), Chen and Glasserman (2004) – option pricing
• Brown, Smith and Sun (2010) – general framework formulated
Applications/extensions:
• Desai, Farias, and Moallemi (2012) – optimal stopping
• Desai at el. (2012), Haugh and Lim (2012) – linear-qaudratic and linear-convex control
• Haugh and Wang (2014) – dynamic portfolio execution
• Kim and Lim (2016) – robust MAB
• Brown and Haugh (2017) – inﬁnite horizon MDPs
• Haugh and Lacedelli (2019) – POMDPs
