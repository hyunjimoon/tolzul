We study how industry clockspeed, internal ﬁrm factors, such as product development, production, and inventory costs, and competitive factors determine a ﬁrm’s optimal new-product introduction timing and product-quality decisions. We explicitly model market demand uncertainty, a ﬁrm’s internal cost structure, and competition, using an inﬁnite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on a large-scale numerical analysis, we ﬁnd that more frequent new-product introductions are optimal under faster clockspeed conditions. In addition, we ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s optimal product-quality decision is governed by a ﬁrm’s relative costs of introducing new products with incremental versus more substantial improvements. We show that a time-pacing product introduction strategy results in a production policy with a simple base-stock form and performs well relative to the optimal policy. Our results thus provide analytical support for the managerial belief that industry clockspeed and time to market are closely related.

Key words: speed to market; time pacing; Markov decision processes
