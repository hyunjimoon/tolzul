learning abstract kwlg as infernce in hier.model
abstraction can happen early (inductive constraints; )

cmwd: model class C -> model M -> parameter w, data d

p(D|M) = 

joint inference of degree of polynomical and weights of polynomial (samples from posterior, polynomial update to eight)

shape: progrmatic (drawing primitive,)

🙋‍♀️higher abstraction: operations, primitive??

T2bases: polynomial, fourier: poly1,2,3 (T) -> new measurement affects (substittue); structure of scientific revolution; high level conceptual framework

representing forming, fitting require abstraction 

discrete objects and particles, wave functions, manifolds, energy coupling (quantum mechanics, field; fundamental uncertainty)
level2: force?: gravity, electromag (generalizing; lagrangian and hamiltonian, think about ways move thru space and time)
level1: second derivate of moition

not testable (set up kinds of prediction you make) - infer or decide 

pride itself on rationality, thinking or change is social/athetic/economic phenomena

lia handerson tries to rationalize (epistemic criteria) not testing paradiagm against data

notion of paradigm (bases, models, speicfic curves) ; re-organize way of thinking = hier.bayes

measurements of vertical

incommensurability (better fit to the data - hierarchical ; rational tradeoff; empirical and not empirical - can justify the idea; not fully driven by the datafit but are affected by it), 

model m is good if (typical parameter setting)

⭐️good model if assigns good prior more likely in advance (pragmatic)

space of polynomial (deg.5)

posterior over the weight of the function

parameter of curve level, type of curve (line or quadratice), fourier or polynomial

incorrect belief that fourier, but 

should be polynomial when it is fourier

without knowing how data gnerating function and its measurement evolves, i confused how this can rationalize paradigm shift. 

more confident on highest level (before knowing polynomial; jointly become confident; degree is typical middle range)  

falseely believing 

how complex it is, posteior degree to the highest degree (mix more freequencys; complexity)

anamolies from new measurement technology

⭐️⭐️measurement should be included in substantive theory

occum's razar - "low level's complexity is emergent property" (SIZE principle - any model probability ; predict more than )

if a model is true then it is simple -> if it is simple, then it is true

lower sigma (higher precision) -> 

precision becomes higher, model becomes more 

efficinecy (notion of rationality)

higher precision leads to indistinguishable = (high complexity hypothesis space)
