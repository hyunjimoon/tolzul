Inverse of [[_Operator dedConvolute()]].

Tree is the best form of implementation and our axiom suggests close (good) enough implementation exists within tree expression. This limits the entire candidate set to be inspected promoting `verification` (`decision`) to a tool for `optimization`.

what: Â decrease coinflips ðŸª™ðŸª™ -> ðŸª™ so as to make the problem solvable;   
how: sync two coinflips, meaning given one, the other is fully determined
