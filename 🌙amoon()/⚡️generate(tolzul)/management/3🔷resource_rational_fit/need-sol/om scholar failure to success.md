I believe a systemic approach can benefit many PhD first year students like me who are overwhelmed by the high dimension of both attention and decision. 


  
  4. How solution addresses problem's root cause
  that can support my strategy (with competitive advantage on computational statistics tool building, develop an architecture that can produce research) and goal 

1. (long term) contribute to the Bayesian entrepreneurship field with research that can impact both scholars and practitioners
2. (mid term, 2027) list of candidate for market (e.g. IS department) and product (e.g. hypothesis from simulation tool)
3. (short term, 2024,25,26 ) list of target journals for 1, or where I could best elicit this information

| Fine et al. (2022)               | Entrepreneurial operations model | Ten tools for entrepreneurs to scale up      | OM research landscape is complex and ever-expanding which gives  unique challenges to early stage scholars |
| Eisenmann (2021)<br>             | Failure analysis of startups     | Identifying and addressing common pitfalls   | Early stage scholars face common pitfalls such as false starts, bad bedfellows, and premature scaling      |
| Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)<br> | Failure analysis of a nation     | role of institutions in economic development | Institutional support can lower the failure rate of early stage scholars which is crucial for OM community |
