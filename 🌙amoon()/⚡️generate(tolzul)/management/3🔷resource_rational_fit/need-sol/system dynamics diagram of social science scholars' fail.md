- individual-wise, we can optimize resource allocation to `growing search, need, method, delivery capa`
- institution-wise, we can re-optimize `pairing, production, research diffusion, paper life time`

| fleshing paired need sol | 3. Fulfilling customer's need with technology's solution - turning tested Proof of Concept into Product | Measurement validating theory and phenomena pair |
| transporting | 3. Productizing - delivering finished Product to customers based on demand | routing |
| N/A | N/A | integrating |

The updated table includes a third column matching variables with similar roles across the system dynamics model. This helps to identify the key processes and their corresponding variables:

1. Pairing needs and solutions: combining need sol, pairing
2. Growing capacity to identify needs: collecting need, growing identifying relevant phenomena capa 
3. Growing capacity to provide solutions: collecting sol, growing theory search capa
4. Implementing need with customer: need2transp ratio, demand bit2atom, collecting transport, growing delivery capa
5. Validating need-solution pairs: fleshing paired need sol, Measurement validating theory and phenomena pair, collecting method, growing measuremtn capa
6. Productizing and delivering to customers: desired fleshing rate, transporting, routing

Additional variables like integrating and shelving relate to the flow between speculation, unit theory, programmatic theory and application. Let me know if you have any other questions!
