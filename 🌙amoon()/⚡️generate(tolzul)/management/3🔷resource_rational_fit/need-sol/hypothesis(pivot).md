| Hypothesis 1 | Negative <font color  = red>mu_a_d</font> can be overcome by large <font color  = green>mu_b_d</font> or <font color  = "#C0A0C0">mu_c_d</font>                    | High profit when <font color  = red>mu_a_d</font> < 0 but <font color  = green>mu_b_d</font> and <font color  = "#C0A0C0">mu_c_d</font> are large |
| Hypothesis 2 | Higher <font color  = green >mu_b_d</font> leads to increased profit when <font color  = red>mu_a_d</font> and <font color  = "#C0A0C0">mu_c_d</font> are constant | Increased profit as <font color  = green>mu_b_d</font> increases                                                                                  |
| Hypothesis 3 | Balanced combination of <font color  = red>mu_a_d</font>, <font color  = green>mu_b_d</font>, <font color  = "#C0A0C0">mu_c_d</font> yields highest profit         | Optimal profit when <font color  = red>mu_a_d</font>, <font color  = green>mu_b_d</font>, <font color  = "#C0A0C0">mu_c_d</font> are balanced     |

| In slow clockspeed industries (e.g., aircraft, steel, shipbuilding), mu_a and mu_b will be higher during the Nail and Scale stages compared to fast clockspeed industries (e.g., personal computers, semiconductors, toys and games).          | Higher mu_a and mu_b suggest a greater emphasis on A and T actions in slow clockspeed industries during the Nail and Scale stages.                                                                                                                                              | Slow: Aircraft (commercial), Steel, Shipbuilding<br>Fast: Personal computers, Semiconductors, Toys and games | Adjust mu_a and mu_b values based on the industry clockspeed (higher for slow clockspeed) and observe the impact on the optimal action sequences and resource allocation.                                    |
| In fast clockspeed industries (e.g., athletic footwear, smartphones), mu_c will be lower during the Nail stage compared to slow clockspeed industries (e.g., petrochemicals, paper).                                                           | A lower mu_c indicates less emphasis on C actions in fast clockspeed industries during the Nail stage, implying a different prioritization of activities compared to slow clockspeed industries.                                                                                | Fast: Athletic footwear, Smartphones (part of computer-aided)<br>Slow: Petrochemicals, Paper                 | Set a lower value for mu_c in fast clockspeed industries during the Nail stage and compare the optimal action sequences and resource allocation with slow clockspeed industries.                             |

| The optimal sequence and relative importance of A, T, C, and G actions will vary depending on the industry clockspeed and the startup's market approach, leading to differences in the convergence of beliefs to ground truth.                 | Analyze how the activity sequences (A, T, C, G) evolve over time and across different industry clockspeed and market approach scenarios, and relate these sequences to the convergence of beliefs to the ground truth in the simulation model.                                  | Applicable to all industries mentioned in the image                                                          | Run simulations with different parameter settings (mu_a, mu_b, mu_c) based on the industry clockspeed and market approach, and observe how the beliefs converge to the ground truth under various scenarios. |
| Startups that prioritize A and T actions in the early stages (Nail and Scale) will have a higher likelihood of success in slow clockspeed industries, such as aircraft (military) and shipbuilding, compared to fast clockspeed industries.    | Investigate how prioritizing A and T actions in the early stages affects the activity sequencing and resource allocation in slow clockspeed industries, and compare this with fast clockspeed industries to understand the differences in startup success rates.                | Slow: Aircraft (military), Shipbuilding<br>Fast: Personal computers, Semiconductors, Toys and games          | Assign higher values to mu_a and mu_b in the early stages for slow clockspeed industries and observe the impact on the success rate (i.e., reaching the "Scale" state) in the simulation model.              |
| The relative importance of C actions will increase in later stages (Scale and Sail) for startups in fast clockspeed industries, such as cosmetics and fast food, as customer needs evolve more rapidly compared to slow clockspeed industries. | Examine how the increasing importance of C actions in later stages influences the activity sequencing and resource allocation for startups in fast clockspeed industries, and compare this with slow clockspeed industries to highlight the differences in customer engagement. | Fast: Cosmetics, Fast food<br>Slow: Aircraft (commercial), Steel                                             | Gradually increase the value of mu_c in the Scale and Sail stages for fast clockspeed industries and analyze the impact on the optimal action sequences and resource allocation in the simulation model.     |
