| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Core Concept | Firms achieve sustainable competitive advantage through unique resources and capabilities |
| Key Assumptions | - Firms are heterogeneous in terms of the resources they control |
|  | - Resources may not be perfectly mobile across firms |
| Resource Characteristics | VRIN Framework: |
|  | - Valuable: Enables a firm to implement strategies that improve efficiency and effectiveness |
|  | - Rare: Not available to many competitors |
|  | - Inimitable: Difficult for competitors to copy or substitute |
|  | - Non-substitutable: Cannot be easily replaced by alternative resources |
| Types of Resources | - Tangible (e.g., physical assets, financial resources) |
|  | - Intangible (e.g., brand reputation, patents, organizational culture) |
|  | - Human capital (e.g., skills, knowledge, experience of employees) |
| Competitive Advantage | Sustained when a firm has resources that competitors cannot easily acquire, imitate, or substitute |
| Strategic Implications | - Firms should focus on developing and leveraging unique resources |
|  | - Strategy should be based on firm's resources rather than external market positioning |
| Limitations | - Difficulty in identifying and measuring intangible resources |
|  | - May overemphasize internal factors at the expense of external market conditions |
| Empirical Challenges | - Measuring firm-specific effects and resource heterogeneity |
|  | - Isolating the impact of specific resources on performance |
