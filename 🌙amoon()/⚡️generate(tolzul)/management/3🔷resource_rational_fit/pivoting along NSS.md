#segment #pivot
1. The concept of pivot is associated with experimental outcomes. If an experimental outcome supports the hypothesis, the startup continues on the same path. If it doesn't support the hypothesis, the startup pivots to a different path.

2. Pivots are more commonly associated with the "nail" stage (early stage) of a startup rather than the "scale" stage. Pivoting during the scale stage can be very expensive.

3. Pivots can be necessary due to external disruptions, such as new technologies or market changes, which may force a startup to rethink its strategy.

4. Chalire suggests that pivot is an engine for adjustment and growth, but not necessarily for maximum growth. The maximum growth rate would occur when a startup doesn't have to pivot at all. I disagree. Pivoting temporarily slows down growth as it requires making adjustments to the business model or strategy. But pivoting might increase the "feasibility space" of a startup, potentially allowing for exponential growth later.

5. Pivots can lead to identifying more specific market segments, which could be smaller or larger than initially anticipated.

6. different levels of pivots:
   - Changing implementation
   - Changing technology or idea
   - Changing demand (most significant pivot)

7. The speaker mentions that depending on how ambitious a startup is, its pivot strategy and path would differ. What might be a "scale" signal for less ambitious entrepreneur might be update market/product sign for another with higher ambitions. 

8. The conversation suggests that the higher the level of pivot (e.g., changing demand), the wider the room to pivot, as opposed to lower levels where certain aspects are taken as given.
