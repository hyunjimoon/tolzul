bayesian entrepreneurship academic field

scott's goal is measuring ecosystems (from startup cartography project)

- pilots: can you map these not with particular tool but there is potential (agrk?)
- entrepreneurship can create economic growth
- how can you measure own economic hotspot and its growth and quality
- does seeing an ecosystem impact our ability to change an ecosystem?
- insights to gain (norway vs queensleand)
- what are the real contributors? universities? research institutes? follow the paper trail (publications, patents)
- quality in a better indicator
- quantity and quality of these players
- how can we take advantage of this information
- what about the evolution of one ecosystem vs another (e.g. near universities)
- we can map these with a lot of detail (kendall sq.)
- collaboration patterns (physical infrastructure, knowledge economy, corporate)
