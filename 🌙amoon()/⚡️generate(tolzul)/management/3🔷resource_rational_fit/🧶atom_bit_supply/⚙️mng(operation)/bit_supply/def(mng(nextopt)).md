### Roadmap
Based on 1,2,3, I would aim for 4,5
#### 1. B2C+Machine failure lesson (Bakery store owner app)
Need to provide trust in data collection incentives and analytics
Bias-enhanced feedback from frequent human intervention cautions (eg, store owners who order lower orders in response to predictive services giving lower forecasts than actual forecasts to optimize satisfaction, taking into account the asymmetry bias between visible scrap inventory loss and invisible opportunity loss)

#### 2. B2B+Machine Success Factors (LogisAll)
Executives who know “the delay in visualizing the effect of new technology” (worse then better dynamic), and the capacity to withstand the worse period
The structure in which recovery affects the profit of decision makers (long term view)

#### 3. B2Nation+Machine success (military spare parts failure prediction)
Factors that awaken members to “optimization is necessary” such as shortage
*pool data within one layer: Data is not limited individually, it is possible for the entire system

#### 4. B2NB + Machine
Coordinate inter-tier (government-business) and intra-tier (business-business) collaboration. Like the crippled and blind collaboration, agility at the bottom of the hierarchy and durability at the top (*pull)
Design hierarchical auto-scaling mechanism like Wikipedia self-organize

#### 5.  B2NBC+Machine
The relationship in 4 is applied to government-business and business-small business. Collaboration between eyes and ears (small business owners), hands and feet (corporations), and heads (government).
