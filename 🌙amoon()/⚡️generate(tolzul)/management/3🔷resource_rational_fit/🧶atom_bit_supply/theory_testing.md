According to Korea drama [[23signal]], serial killing is defined by at least three victims and existence of interval between events ensuring the separation of each event.[^1] Interestingly, this context-free replication is a desirable trait of a theory. In other words, a theory "civil revolution giving birth to modern capitalism" is fortified with three revolutions in England, France, and America. Mechanisms of durable dominace is illustrated in the context of mutual funds, hollyhood movie, k-pop. 

**Context-severed model and range with a statistical mass**, is initial place to start bayesian inference with **strong structure and priors**, which Andrew assumes [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/01/14/bayesian-statistics-and-machine-learning-how-do-they-differ/).

- how to combine durable dominance with partial model calibration? 
- how to do in-depth interview? + couple interview with text analysis
``` 
Johan uses simulation, very large datasets, social network analysis, machine learning, and computational text analysis, coupled with in-depth interviews with industry participants.

We look into two theories: durable dominance and service process theory

## durable dominance
- by [[Johan Chu]], 
- ingredient: 
	- physics background e.g. sand pile analogy + artificial life
	- advisor jerry's consistency "have been publishing about the changing nature of the public corporation since I completed my PhD in 1990" 
	- ad corporate business 
- table in [[../queue/johan_dominanceðŸ’«ðŸ”­/_def/def(dominance)]]

## service process theory
- by [[Rogelio Oliva]]
- ingredients: thesis
- found more than three main causes: lower commitment, higher upper verified failure models from wide parameter space analyzed 

Let's take durable dominance as an example:

| -               | -   | -   | 
| --------------- | --- | --- |
| mutual funds    |     |     |
| hollywood stars |     |     |
