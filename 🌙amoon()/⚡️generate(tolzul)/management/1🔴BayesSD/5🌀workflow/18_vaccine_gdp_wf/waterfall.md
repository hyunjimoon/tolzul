- behavior feedback (bad for death rate itself, )
- epidemic and economic; not estimated based on actual vaccination
- estimating

what analysis to do looking

covid benefit vs marginal benefit (cluster policy)

both heterogeneity
cost of hospitalization 

over time and different states

immunity marginal vaccine lower
learning reduces the value of vaccine over time (conditioned to fatality of virus)
economic activity happen (economic, healthcare)


learn to change routine (accomodate)

Set up model from 970
dataflow over time
thinking report x, y, z (variable)

infection , death, hospitalization (test)
resolution (stay)
alp: dispersion parameter with ubd as 1 and increase
milion 
change 100,000

graphical ui

1. doing the calibration 
2. generate graph (.voc, .vpd file; quality of fit (hosptialization) -> )
3. analysis

vengine: vdfx 
export dataset (correspanding command vdf2tab)
v78 (outfile from the analysis (overall benefit of vacc, how change over time and state))

V76: test was turned off (switch: 0) payoff: -44444
V78: test was turned off (switch: 1) - lower payoff: -66666 
- vpd (have new component)
