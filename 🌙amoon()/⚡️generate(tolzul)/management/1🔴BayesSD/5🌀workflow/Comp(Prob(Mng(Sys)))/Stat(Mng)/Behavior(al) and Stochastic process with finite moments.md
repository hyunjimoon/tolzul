- Behavior and behavioral are different by #hr 
- "First order model doesn’t consider transmission reduction, thus overestimating the impact of vaccination" from [[def(VaccineMisinf_3D]] 
- is behavioral response endogenous?

• Defining problems dynamically, in terms of graphs over time. • Striving for an endogenous, behavioral view of the significant dynamics of a system, a focus inward on the characteristics of a system that themselves generate or exacerbate the perceived problem. • Thinking of all concepts in the real system as continuous quantities interconnected in loops of information feedback and circular causality. • Identifying independent stocks or accumulations (levels) in the system and their inflows and outflows (rates). • Formulating a behavioral model capable of reproducing, by itself, the dynamic problem of concern. The model is usually a computer simulation model expressed in nonlinear
equations, but is occasionally left without quantities as a diagram capturing the stock-andflow/causal feedback structure of the system. • Deriving understandings and applicable policy insights from the resulting model. • Implementing changes resulting from model-based understandings and insights.

Q. finite or bounded moment? $E[X^k] < \infty$ vs $<M$
