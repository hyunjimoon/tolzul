Grounding Language about Belief in a Bayesian Theory-of Mind

  
This paper explores how humans interpret and attribute beliefs to others through language, specifically within the framework of a Bayesian Theory-of-Mind (BToM). The researchers propose a model that simulates potential mental states—combinations of beliefs, goals, and plans—based on observed actions, and then uses these simulations to evaluate belief statements. This model leverages Bayesian inference and first-order epistemic logic to provide a structured, probabilistic interpretation of belief-related language, emphasizing the close ties between beliefs and the actions they inspire.

To test their model, the authors conducted an experiment where participants watched animations of an agent navigating a puzzle game that involved keys and doors, requiring instrumental reasoning about hidden objects. Participants inferred the agent's goals and beliefs from its actions, and their responses were used to gauge the model's effectiveness.

The results demonstrated that the BToM model closely matched human interpretations of belief statements, suggesting its utility in understanding how people use language to communicate complex mental states. The paper concludes that such models are crucial for advancing our understanding of social cognition and communication, offering a richer insight into the semantics of belief as grounded in theory-of-mind principles.
