quantum computing has the potential to significantly accelerate and enhance the drug discovery process by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations of molecular systems. This could impact the pivoting decisions made by pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups.
### R1
With quantum computing, there may be a higher signal in product pivoting (i.e., changing the molecule, strength, or dosage form) compared to market pivoting (i.e., changing the target disease or population). This is because quantum computers are particularly well-suited for simulating chemical systems and could provide more accurate insights into how changes in the molecule or formulation affect its efficacy and safety. This could lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio.
### R3
The noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, which is the current state of quantum computing, is characterized by noisy and error-prone qubits. In this context, σ (the noisiness of the data) is high. As quantum computers become more reliable and move towards fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), σ will decrease. A higher σ in the NISQ era may lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio, as companies may focus more on optimizing the molecule and formulation to compensate for the noisy data.
### R4
Larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources may have a larger k (the cost threshold for pivoting) compared to smaller biotech startups. With the advent of quantum computing, the cost of pivoting the product (i.e., running quantum simulations to optimize the molecule and formulation) may decrease relative to the cost of pivoting the market (i.e., conducting clinical trials in a new disease area or population). This could lead to a higher pivot product-over-market ratio, especially for larger organizations.

quantum computing could impact the four key questions mentioned:

1. For a given target/disease, quantum computers could help identify the optimal molecule, strength, and dosage form more efficiently by enabling more accurate simulations of the molecular systems.

2. For a given molecule, quantum computers could help predict the most promising disease indications and patient populations by simulating the molecule's interactions with various biological targets.

3. Quantum computers could assist in deciding whether to continue, stop, or pivot an in-house drug discovery program by providing more accurate and timely data on the molecule's potential efficacy and safety.

4. When considering whether to buy or not buy an external drug candidate, quantum computers could help assess the candidate's potential more accurately, informing the decision to acquire the asset and potentially stop internal programs in the same area.

In summary, quantum computing has the potential to significantly impact the pivoting decisions and strategies in drug discovery by providing more accurate and efficient simulations of molecular systems. This could lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio, especially in the NISQ era and for larger pharmaceutical companies.
