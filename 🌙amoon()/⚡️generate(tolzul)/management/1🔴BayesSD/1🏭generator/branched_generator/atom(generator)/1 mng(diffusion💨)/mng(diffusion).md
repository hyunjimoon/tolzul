The fractional net birth rate is a declining function of the population relative to carrying capacity.  The parameter m in the Richards model determines the strengh of the nonlinearity.

target: death rate, onset 
input: 


estimated: time to perceive and reduce risk
PWRisk (scales responsivity) power function 

- exposure as source of process noise
- onset is undercounted so measurement noise may not be centered at zero (what proportion is being detected)
- #tf categorized parameters into largely three:

> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">biological parameter</mark>: ref high risk share, all cause sensitivity, seasonal amplitude, initial infection rate, time to onset, time to infectious, time to onset, time to advance, fraction requiring hospitalization, mild duration, treated fatality rate, untreated fatality multiplier, <mark style="background: #c9252c">behavioral parameter </mark>: initial population, contact density decline, contact stratification, potential frac population quarantined, available hospital beds per capita
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFA500;">policy lever</mark>: group isolation, relative isolation effectiveness pre-symptoms, state policy switch, behavioral risk reduction, relative behavior change for low risk, fatigue threshold?, log behavior change threshold, behavior change threshold, behavior sensitivity, behavior response time
