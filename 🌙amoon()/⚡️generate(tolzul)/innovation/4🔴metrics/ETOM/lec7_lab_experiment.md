information asymmetry (reviewer, host, )

discrimination (may not be more salient)

- different with lab: the more different desire and real, field experiment is better, the more deceptive experiment is
- similar with lab exp: "control of all variable" (the more digitalized; field exp becomes more closer to lab exp)

cost of intervention; amazon (availability of stock; cost) - hypothesis developed before (prior knowledge); discrimination (minimization problem with lower bound 0) (performance; efficiency maximization problem without upper bound)
poc, 

perfect fake account ()

theory (experiment); set theory as control, **lab experiment is the cleanest way to tease out**

ex-post inventory demand: chosen quantity and realized demand 
identify mechanism; policy recommendation; test policy (test policy implication)

max good <-> min bad outcome
control: can see, decision maker better (documented practical problem); prove existed + develop intervention

identifying challenges (lab exp: bias exist) + develop intervention (algorithm) to improve 
health and policy journal  use of minimal risk (administrative data that doesn't affect)

is there any intervention not algorithms?

sequencing, selection, iteration, identify behav bias, 

constraint (impact of how people use private information; ml algorithm)

biased twd NAW (used optimal sol as benchmark)
not use optimal but high and low ()

recognize when they have (re); someone knows ()
