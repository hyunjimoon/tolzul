```
Jules Verne
- Dost thou not understand that there are two distinct forces in us, that of the soul and that of the body, that is, a movement and a regulator?
- atom VS bit? The body regulates the soul, and, like the balance-wheel, it is submitted to regular oscillations.  - The pen is mightier than the sword 
```

## What
In the world of continuous branch and merge, start from your demand. Then draws (estimate) then real data. Generator has the order of sense, science, program. As a modeler, this is reversed; we start from programming `Demand`, sampling scientific `Draws`, collecting sensible `Data`. First step is understanding `Demand` which can be categorized as Defend vs Desire.
