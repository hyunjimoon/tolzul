1. 🌳Nail (Term Sheet Advisor): Angie will focus on developing a probabilistic program to analyze and advise on term sheets for early-stage startups. This involves modeling the complex negotiations and decision-making processes between founders and investors, considering factors like valuation, equity distribution, and investment terms. The goal is to create an AI tool that can help entrepreneurs make more informed decisions during the crucial funding stages of their ventures.

2. ⛰️Scale (Tesla's Cybertruck): For the scaling stage, Angie will examine Tesla's launch of the Cybertruck as a new market segment. This case study will explore how an established company like Tesla manages the transition from niche electric vehicles to a broader market with a radically different product. The focus will be on applying probabilistic programming techniques to model market segmentation, production scaling, and resource allocation challenges faced during this expansion phase.

3. 🌊Sail (Changi Airport): The sailing stage will involve analyzing Changi Airport's operations, particularly their efforts to improve on-time performance while handling increased flight volumes. This includes modeling complex systems like flight scheduling, resource allocation (e.g., gates, ground crew), and the integration of new technologies like autonomous baggage handling. The goal is to use probabilistic programming to optimize airport operations and innovate processes in a mature, "sailing" organization.
