from class (money for startup - celestrial)
ceo, three founders, one advisor

Initial equity split:

You have collectively decided the CEO should own 1,200,000 shares of common stock. The rest of you will each own 800,000 shares. Everyone's stock was issued without any vesting or other restrictions.

Initial fundraising:

You raised an initial pre-seed round from two local angel investors whom you were connected to through Sandbox. You agreed to use a standard post-money YC Safe in each case. The first Safe was for $250K with a valuation cap of $5 million. It closed in October 2022. The second Safe raised $500K with an $8 million cap and closed in May 2023. There are no amendments or side letters. The simple paperwork was done by an aunt who is a tax lawyer. You were busy and didnâ€™t spend much time thinking about the Safes. You were glad you didnâ€™t have to give up equity so early and just hope it was all done correctly. Since this funding closed, youâ€™ve paid yourselves an annual salary of $50k each.

MC received an SBIR Phase 1 award for $300K in August 2023 for work around its proprietary laser approach to extracting PGM. (As a non-dilutive grant, it does not appear on your cap table.)

Early employees:

Early on, you had a fifth team member, Ellen Monk. You promised her 400,000 shares. Ellen put 40-50 hours of work total into your early commercialization strategy as part of your delta-V experience but no technical expertise or IP. You expected she would be an important contributor, but it didnâ€™t work out. Ellen was kind of hard to work with and was always very distracted with other side gigs. She ultimately decided to accept a full time offer at Silicon Valley Bank.

Ellen Monkâ€™s stock has never been issued, there isnâ€™t anything legal or written and itâ€™s kind of an awkward topic. Everybody remembers that it happened, and you all have a few texts discussing it, but it hasnâ€™t been a priority to sort out and it kind of doesnâ€™t feel real anymore. Nobody ever talks about it. In fact, nobody really talks to Ellen either. You put into place a 15% option pool when you closed your first Safe. Itâ€™s been helpful to you to attract great early talent excited by the MC opportunity. But now, the pool is kind of close to running dry. You know youâ€™ll have to top up for future hires. Youâ€™re not really sure how that works yet, though, or how much should go into it.

Stockholders:

In addition to the 4 of you (and maybe Ellen), youâ€™ve also granted stock to an important MIT professor who was very supportive of you in the early days. Professor Fred Rogers was delighted by the generous award of 400,000 shares of common stock and is happy to be part of your cap table. Prof. Rogers doesnâ€™t intend to sit on your board or advisory committee or be active in your future growth, nor did he contribute any IP, but feels gratified by your kind recognition of his early support.

Loan:

Growing a spacetech company is both expensive and takes a long time. Not surprisingly, by Fall 2023, your engineering and science progress translated into much higher burn than planned. As you were beginning the hunt for VC, one of you stepped in with a $300K loan from a windfall short-term gain from closing out an Nvidia holding. You havenâ€™t executed a formal promissory note, but everyone understands that the money was intended to be a loan to help keep the company afloat, and that you expect that founder to be repaid when VC money comes in. In your earlier conversations with your VC, this topic hasnâ€™t surfaced. Youâ€™re not hiding it, of course; youâ€™ve just been focused on other areas.

Current progress:

The beauty of the robust space economy of 2024 has had many benefits: you can buy off-the-shelf a large majority of the components of your multi-purpose laser/vaporizer-sortertransporter-satellite. Thus, your team (and burn) is relatively smaller, able to focus on the unique and custom elements of the MC solution.

You believe that your keen focus on: building a lean, world-class team; velocity (achieving concrete milestones swiftly since the Safes came in); the market size potential (global PGM market = $50 â€“ 60B with fast growth); unit economics (high revenue per payload: PGM prices = $400 - $20,000/oz); and strong market tailwinds all position MIT Celestial for big success. While significant front-end risk remains, the maturing market infrastructure has transformed the risk/return profile for you and for potential investors.

Current fundraising needs:

In order to grow the business faster you need additional capital, and all founders have agreed to do a priced equity round with a venture capital firm who can provide both money and experience, contacts and credibility.

You believe MC should be valued at $14M pre-money, and you want to raise $4M for a few key hires, and primarily for a demonstration mission to test your extraction (vaporizing) and refining (sorting) capabilities in space. You understand that deeptech investors often take a larger percentage stake than software VCs do because of the significant upfront science and engineering risks involved. Your goal for the first MC mining and payload-bearing (revenue generating!) mission is 2029.

how cap table comes into play when company sells, goes public, has liquidity event.

terms: incorporation, equity splits, cap table formation, share classes, fundraising, valuations, option pools, dilution, 

agents: founders, advisors, employees, investors

cap table, raising rounds, converting debt, selling company, 

1. incorporation (authorizing 10milion common shares; 9m issued by; shareclass, by stakeholder, 

grant 100k (less unissued pie got bigger but your slice didn't get bigger - ownership percentage gets dimished; your shares are a small percentage of )

two important columns of cap table by share class, by stakeholders (quantity, price per share), equity splits, option pool)   
(not to be withdraw from the program during my interview of general exam)

Probabilistic programs are designed to model equity value for each owner based on a probabilistic time series of business value

## 1.introducing cap table 
(shareclass, calculating ownership percentages, valuations, vesting schedule)

----
ownership share is same and new share gets added (quantity of share remains the same, percentage drops)

convertible instrument (note or safe; simple agreement for future agreement; investment vehicle - converted to share later time); carol invest $100k - 20% discount, 5m valuation cap in the next round

20% discount, (how much safe would convert into) -

`market approach` (price round (preferred share, )), `income approach` (have some traction), `net asset` (don't generate any revenue)

various types of ownership: 
- common shares, preferred shares (actual share), 
- convertible note, safe, 
- stock options (price is fixed, not share - locking in today (when low) - give ability to buy this as low price)

different types of equity all come with different rules 

time based and milestone based vesting

Based on the provided code and the three dilemmas you've described, I'll extract relevant parts and use them to fill in the first row of the table. Here's the analysis:

1. "Grow faster VS give up more ownership" dilemma:
From option_pool_world_model.py:
```python
def talent_attraction_factor(pool_size):
    return {0.05: 1.0, 0.10: 1.2, 0.15: 1.5}[pool_size]

def founder_ownership_factor(pool_size):
    return 1 - pool_size

def company_growth_utility(pool_size, is_competitive):
    base = 100 * talent_attraction_factor(pool_size)
    return base * 1.5 if is_competitive else base

def founder_utility(pool_size):
    return 100 * founder_ownership_factor(pool_size)
```

2. "Flexibility VS efficiency" dilemma:
From board_composition_world_model.py:
```python
def decision_speed_factor(structure):
    return {'founder-control': 1.5, 'balanced': 1.2, 'vc-control': 1.0}[structure]

def expertise_factor(structure):
    return {'founder-control': 1.0, 'balanced': 1.3, 'vc-control': 1.2}[structure]
```

3. "Incentive VS alignment" dilemma:
From vesting_schedule_world_model.py:
```python
def motivation_factor(vesting, upfront):
    return (1 - vesting / 4) * (1 + 2 * upfront)

def long_term_commitment_factor(vesting, cliff):
    return vesting / 4 + cliff / 2
```

Now, let's use these extracted parts to fill in the first row of the table:

| Category                                                             | Decision Variable       | Details |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| <font color="red">Action</font><br>probabilistic reasoning can drive | multi-objective: weight |         |

This filled-in row captures the essence of the three dilemmas you've described, using the specific functions from the provided code to illustrate how probabilistic reasoning can drive multi-objective weighting in entrepreneurial decision-making.

Certainly! I'll extend the first row's cell by showing how total utility is decided by weighted averages for each of the three dilemmas. Here's the updated content:

| Category                                                             | Decision Variable       | Details |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| <font color="red">Action</font><br>probabilistic reasoning can drive | multi-objective: weight |         |

This extended version shows how the total utility for each dilemma is calculated using weighted averages, and how these individual utilities contribute to an overall total utility. The weights (w1-w6, Î±, Î², Î³) allow for flexibility in prioritizing different factors based on the company's stage and specific circumstances, aligning with the Nail It vs. Scale It optimization concept.
