In today's entrepreneurial landscape, there remains a critical gap in tools that democratize access to sophisticated financial decision-making. This research proposes a novel probabilistic programming framework for optimizing startup capitalization operations, focusing on early stage startup's capitalization vehicle like Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). Our goal is to create more equitable and interpretable systems for financial decision-making in entrepreneurship, empowering founders with probabilistic program-based tools that enable them to effectively communicate their value and potential to investors. This approach aims to level the playing field, particularly for underrepresented founders, by facilitating more informed and balanced negotiations that encourage investors to join in taking intelligent risks together.

Aligning with the MIT Probabilistic Computing Lab (PI: Vikash Mansinghka)'s perspective on intelligence, we diverge from large-scale neural modeling. Instead we interpret intelligence as decision making on world model, combining symbolic, probabilistic, and differentiable computation. This method enables AI systems to handle uncertainty and complex world models more effectively, leading to more accurate modeling of intricate financial terms, improved handling of rare events, and enhanced decision-making for entrepreneurs and investors.

Our research involves developing:
1. A probabilistic programming framework for SAFE optimization
2. Algorithms for perceiving, reasoning, and planning in SAFE contexts
3. Conversational inference and investment term synthesis capabilities

This work is not only technically innovative but also has the potential to address systemic inequities in startup financing by providing access to sophisticated financial modeling tools to entrepreneurs who are resource-constrained. Founders often fail capturing value from their idea and efforts as they didn't pay due attention in financing, especially guarding their equity.

Our approach offers significant advantages over existing baselines such as statistical regression models, Monte Carlo simulations, and in-context prompted language models. It can handle complex terms and dynamic scenarios with greater flexibility and consistency. This research is highly relevant to Two Sigma's interests in quantitative finance and entrepreneurship. It could enhance the firm's ability to evaluate early-stage investments, develop sophisticated valuation models, and create AI-driven advisory tools.

Two Sigma's mentorship could accelerate this research by providing:
1. Access to real-world startup data for model validation
2. Insights into practical challenges in startup valuation and investment
3. Support for developing scalable implementations of our models

While our initial focus is on the early stage, this research lays the groundwork for extending probabilistic programming approaches to the scaling and mature stages of startup development.

In conclusion, this research aims to revolutionize startup capitalization decision-making through advanced probabilistic programming techniques, with a specific focus on increasing equity and diversity in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. By developing a conversational AI system for startup valuation and equity allocation, we address a critical need in entrepreneurship while advancing the field of AI. The potential impact extends beyond immediate applications in startup financing to broader questions of decision-making under uncertainty, potentially opening doors for a more diverse group of innovators and investors in the technology sector.
