- how does atom and bit coordination speed differs in bathtub coordination and could the metric differ for atom and bit? my hypothesis was minimizing cost (offensive, optin) for atom and maximizing benefit (defensive) for [[two_box]]'s objective function differs e.g. 

slow clock speed allows one polyhedron at nail, scale it stage (juicero could have survived with portfolio of products), so the strategy is finding cutting plane without any branch and bound or lift and project. Fast clock speed gives opportunity to have many polyhedrons
