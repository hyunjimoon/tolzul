[**digital phenotyping**](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/research/ "Research Areas"), “moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype, in situ, using data from personal digital devices, in particular smartphones”
 
 Our research in this area includes but is not limited to behavioral patterns, sleep, social interactions, physical mobility, gross motor activity, cognitive functioning, and speech and language production. As part of our efforts in this area, our group has developed and maintains the open-source [Beiwe research platform](https://www.beiwe.org/) for high-throughput smartphone-based digital phenotyping. As an alternative to deploying the open-source version, we make it possible for anyone to use this platform through our [Beiwe Service Center](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/beiwe-service-center/), which is a formal [Harvard University Service Center](https://osp.finance.harvard.edu/service-centers) and the use of the service is based on a costing model which is reviewed annually. Unlike the large majority of commercially available smartphone applications, Beiwe is intended for biomedical research, and the most important aspect of the front-end application is the collection of raw sensor and phone use data. Our primary activity in this area is the development of statistical learning methods, their implementation in software, and their incorporation in the AWS-based Beiwe back-end system.
