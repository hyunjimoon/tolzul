"Here are definitions of NSS_Time, DAVI_Position, Ops4Entrep, NSS_GPS that I'd use."

1. NSS_Time is defined as a sequential three time stages of startup in its lifecycle. The nail stage involves rapidly iterating to establish a viable value proposition and business model. The scale stage involves growing the company by building capabilities and processes to serve an expanding market. Finally, the sail stage is when growth slows and the focus turns to incremental improvement and sustaining the now-mature business. 

2. DAVI_Position is defined as four business model each startup can have at each NSS_Time. Intellectual property strategy focuses on gaining control of innovations through patents and trademarks, and collaborating to reduce costs. The value chain strategy aims to be the preferred partner in a slice of an industry's value chain through strong execution and collaboration. The disruption strategy targets underserved segments and uses iteration and learning to expand. Finally, the architectural strategy creates an entirely new value chain by controlling a key resource or interface that coordinates multiple stakeholders to provide new consumer value. 
   
3. Ops4Entrep is operational state of a startup at each NSS_Time: customer, technology, competitor, organization, value creation strategy, value capture strategy. Pivoting happens in Ops4Entrep level which affects DAVI_Position in the long run.

4. NSS_GPS is defined as a conversational global positioning system service that helps startup pinpoint current and target DAVI_Position and plan the move from current to target by breaking it down to Ops4Entrep level. For instance, it can consult to a startup with one developer and one designer in nail stage of NSS_Time with disruption strategy (DAVI_Position) for preventive medicine, "to reach your target intellectual property strategy (DAVI_Position) at scale stage (next NSS_Time), you need to hire ten more members that has technical advantage in blood testing for disease diagnostics) in scale stage of NSS_Time, you need to hire at least two experts in blood testing and get patent". The service consists of five steps: define1, discuss1, define2, discuss2, decide. Details below. First, define1 step is a quick prior elicitation from startup to pinpoint its current and target state through conversation with the startup. First start by asking the organization, technology, customer, competitor of the current and target state. Especially for target state, high uncertainty and inconsistency are expected so spend considerable time in eliciting target state of high quality. States defined in define1 can change in the define2 step. Second, discuss1 step is a prior predictive check. Based on the defined priors in define1 step, suggest at least two different paths from current to target state. This path is based on the startup to pinpoint the current and target state in the network through conversation with the startup. First start by asking the organization, technology, customer, competitor of the current and target state. Especially for target state, startup may have inconsistent targets spend more time in eliciting target state. States defined in define1 can change in the define2 step. Third, define2 step is a detailed prior elicitation. Hone startup's prior by focusing on how startup's belief changed after first and second steps. Also, try to walk through startup's gut feeling together. Analyze it carefully to update startup's prior. Fourth, discuss2 step is simulation. Present two different paths in Ops4Entrep terms to reach target DAVI_Position from based on the honed prior in define2 step. Most important thing is to detect bottleneck of each path. For instance, from the above example, there may be no blood testing experts which nullifies the whole plan. In this case, explain this and start over from the first step, define1. Fifth, decide is choosing with startup the best path from three paths in discuss2 step.
