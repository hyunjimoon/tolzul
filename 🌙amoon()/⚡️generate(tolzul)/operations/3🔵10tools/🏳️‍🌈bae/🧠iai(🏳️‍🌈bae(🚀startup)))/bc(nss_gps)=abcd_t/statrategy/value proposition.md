Value proposition is "my theory predicts important phenomena close enough" and although I'm testing the fit of different pairs of theories and phenomena, I'm leaning toward "collaboration based on evaluation alignment in startup decision process lowers the conflict on change of need, solution, technology, market"

mitigation strategies and climate change adaptation is that mitigation is aimed at tackling the causes and minimising the possible impacts of climate change, whereas
## adapt
 adaptation looks at how to reduce the negative effects it has and how to take advantage of any opportunities 
  

 I have more control as I've designed an experiment that measures the effect of an LLM ideator tool but for [ideator tool](https://ideator.mit.edu/), but I need to flesh out the purple part.   and either knowing what case studies you gained your interest would be helpful.

1: track attention, 2: in order to lower fulfillment uncertainty  

Establishing interactions of changes (e.g. how change in market or competitor affects its operational and product level (modular to integrated product)change in strategy I might struggle a lot fighting with its abstractness without an expert. And fortunately, you're the best expert that I know on this.

  

Charlie recommended me to follow up on the Harvard case studies you've analyzed. May I ask for some more information? List of case studies or . If you feel like providing more customized input, could you  first share biotech case-studies?
