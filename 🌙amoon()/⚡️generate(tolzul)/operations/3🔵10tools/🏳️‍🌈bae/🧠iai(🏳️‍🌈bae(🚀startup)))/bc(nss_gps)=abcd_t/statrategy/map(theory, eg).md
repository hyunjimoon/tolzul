## using existing atom_supply effect
- #cfq would entrants have $b_{t+t_i}$ ?
  
- prototypes: how will this product look and work: need, e_apx, `bit_supply`  
- proof of concept: is this possible with a given tech: need-sol, e_opt_alg, `atom_supply`  
- minimum viable product: will users use it? iterated (need-sol), e_stat, (`bit_supply` and `atom_supply`)<->(`customer`)

$t_e < t_i$ (timestep)
e: 
1. $\alpha |\gamma, \beta_{t-t_e}$
i: $\alpha|\gamma, \beta_{t+t_i}$

### need leading
- fail: skinny girl 
- success: ministry of supply (didn't had prototye)

### sol leading
- fail: over-spec?? (overcome with pivot?)
- success: angularity 

~ proposition 3: if the technology is disruptive, entrants have lower exploitation probability; sustaining, entrants have higher exploitation probability than incumbants
