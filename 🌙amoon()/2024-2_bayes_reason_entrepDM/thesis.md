Why is probabilistic reasoning not well adopted in our lives? First goal of this thesis is to find the root cause of this problem. Categorizing failure modes with value chain process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) suggest actionable solutions for each. Second goal is to suggest tools that address root cause. cannot consider different usecase context. 

Using the chemical equation below, I show end to end value chain of  `Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS` . Chemical equation of this goal 
`Probabilistic Reasoning SOL + Probabilistic Reasoning NEED -> usable Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS`

The value chain includes five process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) which can be catalyzed by five stakeholders (algorithm builder, tool builder, model builder, policy designer, stakeholder). Instance of this equation class is:

```
Bayesian Reasoning SOL + Bayesian Entrepreneurship NEED - (catalyze) -> usable Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS
```


In entrepreneurial system, Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS is low (Fine et. al. 2022). I'd like to catalyze  chemical equation. 

In 2016, I was shocked from an interview with bakery owners that the simplest regression based demand forecasting and inventory optimization algorithms are not used. This led me to start a startup that develop smart and simple analytics tool. Three lessons I learned:
- prioritize goal (primary: learn why analytics tools are not used, secondary: add startup to my career which is helpful for studying abroad) and communicate
- understand startup and CEO are different agents
- understand existence of different entrepreneurial strategies: architectural (compete and control) vs value chain strategy (collaborate and execute)
- massive adoption of probabilistic reasoning needs
