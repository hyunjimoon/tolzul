----
- Lilliput: The conflict over egg-breaking symbolizes religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, particularly the absurdity of wars fought over minor doctrinal differences.

- Brobdingnag: The magnifying glass revealing skin imperfections symbolizes how closer examination of human nature exposes its flaws and imperfections.

- Laputa: The floating island's inhabitants represent Swift's satirical view of impractical intellectuals and scientists who are so absorbed in theoretical pursuits that they lose touch with practical reality.
  
- The Houyhnhnm-Yahoo relationship symbolizes the conflict between reason and passion, with logical horses representing humanity's aspirational rationality and bestial humanoids representing our baser instincts, while the stark division ultimately satirizes both pure reason taken to an extreme and humanity's capacity for self-deception about its own nature.
