### Tips for Using the Table

1. **Parallel Format:** Each row covers the same points, so it’s easy to compare methods.
2. **Concrete Bullet Points:** Brief statements clarify each method’s strengths, flaws, and simulation-based fixes.
3. **Real-World Relevance:** The final column shows _how_ Bayesian-simulation-optimization synergy addresses each limitation.

Feel free to adjust wording or add examples specific to your thesis context. Let me know if you need any further refinements!

## Key Implications for Thesis Structure:

1. **Integration**: Each methodological approach reveals different aspects of truth, just as each of Swift's countries highlights different human foibles

2. **Complementarity**: The weaknesses of each approach can be offset by strengths of others:
   - Optimization's granularity + Agent-Based Simulation's emergence
   - DE's elegant abstraction + Bayesian calibration
   - etc.

3. **GPT Agent Role**: The agent can serve as:
   - Translator between approaches
   - Pattern identifier across methods
   - Bridge between theory and application
   - Guard against each method's characteristic pitfalls

# Bayesian Calibrated Choice (BCC)

## Hypotheses
This thesis examines two fundamental hypotheses about Bayesian Calibrated Choice (BCC). First, BCC provides an effective framework through its self-consistent learning rule, which we demonstrate through simulation-based calibration. Second, BCC offers computational efficiency by reducing the dimensionality of the exploration problem, analyzed from both individual founders' and society's perspectives.

## Chapter 1: Research Objective 

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
could you make research objective more coherent with hypothesis? also, "a framework for understanding the sources of belief heterogeneity, and algorithms for both societal matching and individual pathfinding in entrepreneurial decision-making." seems less relevant with what comes before.

In business and economics, calibration serves as a crucial foundation for value-based action. While Bayesian theorem provides a philosophical foundation for calibration, traditional sequential decision-making applications assume state and actions are given. However, in entrepreneurial contexts, states that affect actions can always be decomposed further, making the distinction between state and action fluid. This thesis addresses this challenge by developing two key components: a framework for understanding the sources of belief heterogeneity, and algorithms for both societal matching and individual pathfinding in entrepreneurial decision-making.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Background on Bayesian Calibrated Choice

### 2.1 Foundations of BCC

#### 2.1.1 Optimization Approach
The optimization approach integrates insights from decision science and statistical decision theory as developed by Charlie, alongside discrete choice analysis from Mosche. This foundation provides the mathematical framework for understanding how agents optimize their choices under uncertainty.

#### 2.1.2 Bayesian Approach
The Bayesian approach combines Bayesian statistics, pioneered by Andrew, with Bayesian cognition developed by Josh. This integration encompasses SBC/prior/posterior re-calibration, Bayes factor analysis, rational meaning construction, and inverse planning for mental model inference, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how agents update their beliefs and make decisions.

#### 2.1.3 Simulation Approach
System dynamics, as developed by John, along with dynamic modeling and calibration techniques from Tom, provide the foundation for our simulation approach. This framework incorporates MCMC methods to simulate and analyze complex decision-making processes in entrepreneurial contexts.

#### 2.1.4 Bayesian Calibrated Choice Integration
BCC synthesizes optimization, Bayesian, and simulation approaches into a unified framework that emphasizes context-dependent calibration. This integration leverages system dynamics concepts of flows and stocks to model the interplay between actions and states in entrepreneurial decision-making.

### 2.2 Application in Entrepreneurship

#### 2.2.1 Bayesian X Optimization
The integration of Bayesian methods with optimization theory provides a novel framework for understanding entrepreneurial decision-making. This approach specifically addresses how entrepreneurs handle the duality between states and actions while pursuing opportunities without regard to currently controlled resources.

#### 2.2.2 Bayesian X Simulation
Simulation-based calibration reveals the advantages of non-centered parameterization over centered parameterization in entrepreneurial contexts. This framework helps explain how entrepreneurs can effectively navigate uncertainty through iterative learning and adaptation.

#### 2.2.3 BCC Framework
The complete BCC framework synthesizes optimization and simulation approaches while emphasizing context-dependent calibration. This integration provides a robust foundation for analyzing entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty.

## Chapter 4: Conclusion
The conclusion synthesizes our findings supporting both hypotheses, demonstrating how BCC provides both an effective self-consistent learning rule and efficient dimensionality reduction in entrepreneurial exploration. We discuss implications for both theory and practice, suggesting directions for future research in entrepreneurial decision-making.

Cases in startup investment
Cases in strategic decision-making

First Paragraph:
PayPal's founding story illustrates a fundamental challenge in entrepreneurial theory-building. The founders developed a causal theory where θ (encryption technology working) was hypothesized as critical for Y (company success). They operated under two interconnected beliefs: P(Y|θ=1) suggested a high probability of success with working encryption, while P(Y|θ=0) indicated near-zero chance of success without it. This theoretical framework wasn't just about predicting success given encryption capability (forward prediction); it fundamentally shaped their strategic decisions about resource allocation and technology development priorities.

Second Paragraph:
The need for calibration emerges when we recognize that entrepreneurial theories can be tested bidirectionally. While PayPal's founders focused on P(Y|θ) (probability of success given encryption works), equally important is P(θ|Y) (probability that encryption was crucial given success). This bidirectional relationship introduces a natural symmetry in belief validation - if encryption is truly critical, we should observe both that companies with encryption tend to succeed AND that successful companies tend to have strong encryption. However, founders often focus primarily on the forward direction (θ → Y) while underutilizing the valuable information contained in the reverse direction (Y → θ). This asymmetric attention to causal relationships can lead to miscalibrated beliefs about what truly drives success.

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P(θ)                 | Prior probability of encryption technology working   | Founders' initial belief about likelihood of developing working encryption |
| P(Y\|θ=1)            | Probability of success given encryption works        | Founders' belief that working encryption would lead to success             |
| P(Y\|θ=0)            | Probability of success given encryption doesn't work | Founders' belief that success was unlikely without encryption              |
| P(θ\|Y=1)            | Probability encryption was crucial given success     | Validation measure: among successful companies, how many needed encryption |
| P(Y)                 | Overall probability of success                       | Weighted average: P(Y\|θ=1)P(θ) + P(Y\|θ=0)(1-P(θ))                        |

Third Paragraph: The symmetry between θ (actual encryption capability) and θ̃ (founders' prior belief about encryption) in PayPal's case reveals a crucial aspect of Bayesian calibration. Just as founders can simulate forward from their beliefs about encryption to predict success, we can work backward from observed successes to validate those beliefs. This symmetry suggests that if the founders' theory about encryption's importance is well-calibrated, then both forward prediction (P(Y|θ)) and backward inference (P(θ|Y)) should yield consistent probabilities. The four key equations from SBC framework provide a systematic way to check this consistency: the self-consistency equation ensures the prior maintains its structure through data averaging, the joint distributions (both population and MP2 decompositions) verify the symmetry between believed and actual importance of encryption, and the three-step procedure offers a practical way to validate these beliefs through simulation.

| 🔄Self Consistency (1) | πprior(θ) = ∫∫ πpost(θ\|y)πobs(y\|θ̃)πprior(θ̃) dy dθ̃ | The overall belief about encryption's importance should remain consistent whether assessed directly or through observing multiple startups' outcomes |
| 🍾Population Decomposition (2) | πSBC(y, θ, θ̃) = πprior(θ̃)πobs(y\|θ̃)πpost(θ\|y) | PayPal's prior belief about encryption (θ̃), observed market success given encryption (y\|θ̃), and updated beliefs about encryption's importance (θ\|y) should form a coherent story |
| 📖MP2 Decomposition (3) | πSBC(y, θ, θ̃) = πmarg(y)πpost(θ\|y)πpost(θ̃\|y) | If encryption truly matters, successful companies (y) should show both high prior belief in encryption (θ̃) and actual encryption capability (θ) |

pre-Bayesian exchangeability-based surprise.
This idea relates to the unexpected discovery that two seemingly unrelated things work well together, leading to the suspicion of a hidden or latent parameter connecting them. You used the mRNA platform as an example to illustrate this concept. In this context, you likely explained how researchers or companies might have been surprised to find that mRNA technology, initially developed for one purpose, proved effective in multiple, apparently unrelated applications. This surprising effectiveness across different domains led to the hypothesis that there might be an underlying, previously unrecognized parameter or principle (the latent parameter) that explains why the mRNA platform works so well in various contexts. Your comment seems to have been exploring how this type of unexpected discovery can lead to new insights and potentially reshape our understanding of a technology or scientific principle. It also touches on how such surprises can guide further research and development efforts, as investigators try to identify and understand the latent parameters that might explain the observed successes. This idea of "exchangeability-based surprise" appears to be a novel or less common concept that you were introducing or explaining in the context of hierarchical modeling and the development of platform technologies like mRNA.

The actor and critic relation is shown between founder and investor. 
Network flow and local balance of path finding 
By casting founder's journey of innovation as network flow problem where belief flow is conserved as 1, I operationalize the flow balance as an algorithm to  with low uncertainty origin and (from idea inception to impact), we interpreting the meaning of flow balance from both individual (founder and investor) and social welfare planner's perspective. 


Startup investing is about more than just providing capital for the highest ROI. Startup investors who believe in founders, support their journey, and strategize on transforming vision into reality, are abundance-mindset leaders who embrace investing for impact and returns. Investors today focus on building relationships, offering strategic guidance, and creating lasting impact, transforming the traditional approach of 1 in 10 of startup surviving to a more mindful 9 out of 10 survival rate for customer-centric startups.


Why is probabilistic reasoning not well adopted in our lives? First goal of this thesis is to find the root cause of this problem. Categorizing failure modes with value chain process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) suggest actionable solutions for each. Second goal is to suggest tools that address root cause. cannot consider different usecase context. 

Using the chemical equation below, I show end to end value chain of  `Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS` . Chemical equation of this goal 
`Probabilistic Reasoning SOL + Probabilistic Reasoning NEED -> usable Probabilistic Reasoning TOOLS`

The value chain includes five process (design, develop, launch, produce, distribute) which can be catalyzed by five stakeholders (algorithm builder, tool builder, model builder, policy designer, stakeholder). Instance of this equation class is:

```
Bayesian Reasoning SOL + Bayesian Entrepreneurship NEED - (catalyze) -> usable Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS
```


In entrepreneurial system, Entrepreneurial Operation TOOLS is low (Fine et. al. 2022). I'd like to catalyze  chemical equation. 

In 2016, I was shocked from an interview with bakery owners that the simplest regression based demand forecasting and inventory optimization algorithms are not used. This led me to start a startup that develop smart and simple analytics tool. Three lessons I learned:
- prioritize goal (primary: learn why analytics tools are not used, secondary: add startup to my career which is helpful for studying abroad) and communicate
- understand startup and CEO are different agents
- understand existence of different entrepreneurial strategies: architectural (compete and control) vs value chain strategy (collaborate and execute)
- massive adoption of probabilistic reasoning needs
