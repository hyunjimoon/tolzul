[The ergodicity problem in economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0)
- #equilibrium statistical mechanics, time average ~  expectation value of an observable 
- dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time eliminated from models.
- conditions for validity are restrictive, even more so for non-equilibrium systems. Economics typically deals with systems far from equilibrium — specifically with models of growth. It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the prevailing formulations of economic theory — expected utility theory and its descendants — make an indiscriminate assumption of ergodicity. This is largely because foundational concepts to do with risk and randomness originated in seventeenth-century economics, predating by some 200 years the concept of ergodicity, which arose in nineteenth-century physics. In this Perspective, I argue that by carefully addressing the question of ergodicity, many puzzles besetting the current economic formalism are resolved in a natural and empirically testable way.
