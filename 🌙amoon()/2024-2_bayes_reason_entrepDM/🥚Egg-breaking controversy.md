wage war over which side of the egg to crack—an absurdly narrow metric for a bigger reality.


- **The Edict**:
    
    - A past Emperor of Lilliput cut his finger breaking an egg at the larger end.
    - As a result, he issued a law requiring all citizens to break their eggs at the smaller end.
- **Religious and Political Satire**:
    
    - Swift was satirizing the real-world religious and political strife of his time.
    - The argument over how to break an egg is a stand-in for how societies can become bitterly divided over minor doctrinal or ideological differences.
- **War with Blefuscu**:
    
    - Lilliput is at war with the neighboring island of Blefuscu, whose people insist on breaking eggs at the larger end.
    - This minor difference escalates into a major, ongoing conflict, illustrating how pride or tradition can override common sense.
- **Relevance to the “Optimization” Metaphor**:
    
    - In your table, Lilliput’s fixation on egg-breaking rules symbolizes how _over-optimizing for one narrow metric or rule_ can lead to overlooking the broader context.
    - By focusing too much on the “correct way” to do something trivial, a bigger strategic picture (or deeper cooperation) can be lost.
