#### operations
summarize ai for entr (integration of Entrepreneurial Reasoning Framework) into section 4

CMO uses need and solution table [[🧠🤜need_sol]], [[cmo1(ent -> bent)]], [[cmo2(bent -> bsent)]]
COO uses [[mng(stock)]] to make [[coo(sol, case)]]
CTO uses [[kwldg update]] [[cto1(rae, bsem)]]

## ent-mind
Solutions-oriented (self-directed, action-oriented, highly-engaged), Adaptable, Anti-fragile

Anti-fragility has four parts:

Heart — The confidence to say when change occurs that it’s not something to survive, but rather “this is what we were built for,” Aulet said.
Head — The understanding that when change happens, it’s time to act and have a plan of what you’re going to do.
Hand — “It’s not enough to know what to do when we go into battle,” Aulet said. “We have to be able to do it.” It’s converting the head’s knowledge into the capability to get things done.
 
Home — Building a community that can help you get resources, particularly those beyond your control. Know what to do, have the ability to do it, Aulet said, “then you have to be able to marshal the resources very quickly to do it.”

1. Lack of clear value chain mapping for individual modelers
2. Fragmented ecosystem of Bayesian tools and frameworks
3. Misconceptions about Bayesian methods among potential users
