Industries vary dramatically in their clockspeed - defined as the rate at which new product generations are introduced into the market, from monthly updates in software to multi-year cycles in aircraft manufacturing. Traditional explanations have focused on:

Recent literature identifies three main drivers of this heterogeneity: A. Revenue dynamics - arguing that faster clockspeed stems from rapid margin decay and market growth B. Development capabilities - attributing speed to lower development costs and flexible supply chains C. Industry architecture - suggesting modular designs enable faster innovation. As shown in the systematic review table, while each theory captures important aspects, they provide fragmented explanations. [[üìúFine98_clockspeed]] emphasizes architecture, [[üìú‚è∞Souza04_New-Product Strategy and Industry Clockspeed]] focuses on learning effects, while [[üìú‚è∞Carrillo05_Industry Clockspeed and the Pace of New Product Development]] synthesizes multiple drivers such as rate of net revenue decay, development costs, production and supply chain flexibilities. However, these diverse explanations suggest a need for a more fundamental framework.

In fact, there's a simpler explanation. These seemingly distinct drivers can be explained by a more fundamental parameter: the ratio of action (earning) cost to sampling (learning) cost. 

Building on [[üìúVul14_onedone]] 's insight that optimal decision-making balances sampling cost against action cost, we propose that these seemingly distinct drivers can be explained by a single parameter: Action-to-Sample time-cost ratio (A2S). A2S measures how many learning attempts (samples) you can take in the time needed for one earning attempt (action). The key insight is that optimal number of samples per decision action increases proportionally with A2S - when sampling is cheap relative to acting, it's optimal to learn more before each action.

Consider two extremes:

- Software development (A2S = 1440): Code deployment (action) takes 1 day while testing (sample) takes 1 minute. With capacity for 1440 samples per action, frequent small releases are optimal.
- Aircraft manufacturing (A2S = 4): Building a plane (action) takes 2 years while market research (sample) takes 6 months. With only 4 samples possible per action, infrequent major releases are optimal.

This time-based A2S ratio fundamentally explains existing observations:

1. Revenue Dynamics: Consider smartphone manufacturers. Traditional explanations suggest rapid price drops force companies to release new models quickly. However, A2S reveals a deeper truth: phone makers can learn and act fast because testing new features (sampling) and modifying assembly lines (action) are both relatively quick. This high A2S enables both rapid product updates and price changes - the fast margin decay isn't causing the speed, both stem from the ability to learn-and-act quickly.
2. Development Capabilities: Compare Tesla and Boeing - both spend billions on R&D, yet Tesla updates car software weekly while Boeing updates planes every decade. The difference isn't in absolute development spending. Tesla moves faster because pushing software updates (action) is much cheaper relative to testing them (sampling), compared to Boeing's ratio of plane building costs to testing costs. The absolute size of investment matters less than the ratio of doing versus learning costs.
3. Industry Architecture: LEGO vs. custom furniture illustrates why modularity matters. LEGO's modular bricks aren't inherently better - they're valuable because they make trying new combinations (action) very cheap compared to market testing (sampling). While a custom furniture maker might get quick customer feedback (sampling), creating new designs (action) remains expensive. Modularity succeeds precisely when it improves this fundamental action-to-sampling ratio.

This reframing with concrete examples helps explain why some intuitive strategies work (like modular design) while others fail (like just spending more on R&D). The A2S ratio provides the underlying mechanism that connects these seemingly disparate observations. Just as Sutton showed how a single technology parameter explains industry concentration and innovation patterns, A2S provides a unified explanation for varied clockspeeds. This has important implications:

- Focus shifts from absolute costs to the relative costs of acting versus learning
- Explains persistence of slow clockspeeds despite massive R&D investments
- Predicts impact of technologies that affect A2S ratio, like virtual prototyping
