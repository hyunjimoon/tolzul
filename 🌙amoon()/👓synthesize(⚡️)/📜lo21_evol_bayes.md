Lo & Zhang Paper

The paper provides several key insights that support interpreting Bayesian vs evolutionary as short vs long-term approaches:

## Core Theoretical Support:
1. **Finite Memory in Nonstationary Environments**
   - Bayesian heuristics emerge naturally for short-term optimization
   - Finite memory is adaptive for long-term survival in changing environments
   - Trade-off between collecting more information vs waiting too long to act

2. **Three Conditions for Finite Memory**:
   - Markov environments (short-term dependence)
   - Nonstationary environments (changing conditions)
   - Environments where sampling has limited information value

3. **Intelligence Definition**:
   - Ability to increase average fitness (short-term)
   - Correlation with variations in fitness (adaptation)
   - Risk reduction under high variance (long-term survival)

## Implications:
This supports our framework by showing:
- Short-term (Bayesian): Optimal for immediate decision-making with recent information
- Long-term (Evolutionary): Better for adapting to changing environments over time
