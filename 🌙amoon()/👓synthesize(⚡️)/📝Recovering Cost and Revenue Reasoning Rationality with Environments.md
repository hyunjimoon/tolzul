For instance, when oil prices drop (an operational observation), entrepreneurs rationally increase allocation to operational improvement (A actions) as the return on operational efficiency increases. Similarly, when a new competitor enters (a market observation), entrepreneurs shift resources to customer understanding and market segmentation (C actions). This illustrates how entrepreneurs update their expectations (Œº1, Œº2) based on environmental signals and rationally adjust their cognitive resource allocation in response.

### Abstract
We examine entrepreneurial decision-making during company scaling through the lens of resource rationality, introducing the Resource Rationality Ratio (RRR) framework. The RRR framework guides entrepreneurs in optimally allocating limited resources between two fundamental value drivers: (1) building operational capabilities that increase productivity and lower costs, and (2) developing deeper market understanding through segmentation to better approximate customer utility functions and capture higher revenues. Our research demonstrates how operational capabilities fundamentally constrain market value realization, with industry-specific and entrepreneur-specific factors determining optimal resource allocation strategies. Through analysis of the sequential trade-offs between investing in operations versus market understanding - where entrepreneurs, acting as Bayesian agents, must choose one at each decision point while updating their beliefs based on observed outcomes of previous actions - this framework helps explain why certain industry-entrepreneur combinations rationally lead to more analytical "thinkers" while others produce action-oriented "doers". The framework accounts for varying levels of uncertainty in operational versus market metrics, helping entrepreneurs determine when to shift resources between capability building and market expansion. While acknowledging limitations in dynamic environments with competition, our model provides practical guidance for resource-constrained entrepreneurs to make more effective scaling decisions, supported by empirical evidence from diverse industry contexts.

This paper examines how entrepreneurs allocate scarce resources during scaling by introducing a resource rationality framework that explicitly models the trade-off between market understanding and operational capabilities. Our main contributions are:

- A formal framework quantifying resource allocation decisions through the Resource Rationality Ratio (RRR)
- Analysis of asymmetric relationships between operational capabilities and market understanding
- Identification of industry-specific and entrepreneur-specific effects on rational resource allocation
- Methods for reducing inductive bias in entrepreneurial decision-making through meta-cognitive level of resource management

- ‚úÖ Agree with: - Sequential decision-making where each step requires choosing between operations OR market understanding, with Operational capability capping monetization of market knowledge - Both "thinker" and "doer" strategies as rational responses to specific industry-entrepreneur contexts 
- ‚ùå Disagree with: - Traditional decision-making models that don't account for resource constraints in scaling companies - The role of Bayesian inference methods for researchers from Bayesian decision-making by agents should be distinguished

### 1. Resource Rationality Ratio 
The Resource Rationality Ratio provides a framework for optimal allocation of entrepreneurial resources (time, focus, attention) between market understanding and operational capabilities. We define RRR as Value divided by Resources, or (Revenue - Costs) / Investment. This formulation reveals how operations primarily reduces costs in the numerator, while market understanding increases revenue. Through this lens, we can understand investment in market knowledge, operations, and capacity as reducing different types of errors: statistical bias in market understanding, optimization bias in operations, and approximation bias in capacity planning. Importantly, increasing investment or reducing burn rate extends the venture's runway, analogous to running a Markov chain longer to reduce dependence on initial conditions.

### 2. Operations-Market Understanding Relationship
The relationship between operational capabilities and market understanding exhibits important asymmetries. Our analysis reveals that operational capabilities effectively cap market understanding potential, while operational metrics typically demonstrate lower variance than market metrics. This creates a sequential decision-making environment where entrepreneurs must learn and update their understanding of both operational and market uncertainties (œÉ1, œÉ2) and expected returns (Œº1, Œº2) at each time step, comparing utilities of different strategic choices as new information becomes available.

### 4. **Using Inductive bias to formulate sequential decision making of investment **
#### üóÑÔ∏ètable4. improving each components of inductive bias

Based on this, there are three ways to lower reasoning/acting noise:  
1. decrease freedom: anchoring e.g. zappos  
2. increase resource: rich gets richer e.g. elon's deep pocket for tesla roadster [[T2_scm_rr.pdf]]
3. decrease uncertainty: intermediate chains e.g. [scott-charlie-angie-vikash](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/263)

To elaborate, investing in¬†OC¬†vs¬†ME¬†increases quality of¬†technology/organization¬†choice vs¬†customer/competitor¬†choice. Analogy is loose, but I got this idea from "computational rationality" i.e. investing computational resources to inference (`observe` üß† vs decision making `argmax`üìç to increase quality of¬†reasoning¬†vs¬†acting. Three numbers of samples¬†‚ö°from the code attached (10k, 10k, 1k) are corresponding concepts to allocated resources.  
¬†  
food for thought: as costs for testing/partial learning decreases, which of the 1,2,3 would become the most effective? I tested 1,3 and found them effective.¬†
