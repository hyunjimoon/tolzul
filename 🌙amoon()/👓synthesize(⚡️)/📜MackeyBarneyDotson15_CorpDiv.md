The research demonstrates that most firms make rational diversification decisions based on their unique resources and circumstances. Rather than a universal diversification discount or premium, the value impact of diversification varies significantly across firms, with most choosing the strategy‚Äîfocus, related diversification, or unrelated diversification‚Äîthat maximizes their value. This highlights the importance of examining firm-specific effects rather than average relationships when studying strategic choices.
