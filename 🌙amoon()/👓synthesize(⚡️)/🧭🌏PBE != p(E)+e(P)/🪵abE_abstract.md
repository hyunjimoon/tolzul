V1. Decision making fundamentally involves creating new options while abandoning or modifying existing ones. Through a Bayesian lens, we demonstrate how three evolutionary patterns shape this process: adaptation creates options through direct functional selection, co-opted adaptation discovers new options by repurposing existing functions, and co-opted nonaption reveals options by recognizing potential in structural byproducts. Our key insight is that entropy quantifies the duality between function and constraint, measuring how components transition between these roles without requiring predefined categories. This complements de Finetti's exchangeability framework, allowing us to measure innovation through observable patterns rather than assumed probabilities. The characteristic signature - entropy increasing as options proliferate and decreasing as selections stabilize - reveals how different creation pathways manifest in measurable ways. We develop implementation guidelines based on three dimensions: time ratio (ratio of implementation time to development time), reversibility (knowledge's ability to be reused and recombined), and uncertainty profile (ratio of aleatoric to epistemic uncertainty). Through mobility sector case studies, we establish when each pattern is preferred: adaptation for direct creation of functionally-driven solutions, co-opted adaptation for preserving and transferring valuable functions across domains, and co-opted nonaption for transforming apparent constraints into unexpected opportunities. Our framework helps resource-constrained companies achieve nature-like innovation outcomes without replicating nature's computational overhead, while opening new research directions in understanding how options emerge through different evolutionary pathways.

V2 (V1, option creation focus, entropy, duality). Decision making in innovation fundamentally involves the creation of new options. Through a Bayesian lens, we demonstrate how evolutionary patterns – adaptation, co-opted adaptation, and co-opted nonaption – provide a framework for this creation architecture. Our key insight is that entropy quantifies the duality between function and constraint, measuring how components transition between these roles without requiring predefined categories. This complements de Finetti's exchangeability framework, allowing us to measure innovation through observable patterns rather than assumed probabilities. The characteristic signature - entropy increasing as ideas explore new domains, then decreasing as they establish new functions - reveals how structural constraints transform into functional opportunities. We develop implementation guidelines based on three dimensions: time ratio (ratio of implementation time to development time), reversibility (knowledge's ability to be reused and recombined), and uncertainty profile (ratio of aleatoric to epistemic uncertainty). Through mobility sector case studies, we establish when each creation architecture is preferred: functional adaptation for rapid, focused implementation; co-opted adaptation for repurposing existing functions across domains; and co-opted nonaption for exploring how constraints enable unexpected functions. Our framework helps resource-constrained companies achieve nature-like innovation outcomes without replicating nature's computational overhead, while opening new research directions in understanding the function-constraint duality.
