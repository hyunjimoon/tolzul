### Decision Request
We need to decide between Ford Model T vs Tesla Model S as our medium uncertainty example alongside Tesla Roadster (high uncertainty), Tesla Powerwall (medium uncertainty), and Toyota Lean (low uncertainty). Each represents different sampling strategies based on uncertainty level.

### Core Framework Context
We are building a hierarchy that shows how evolutionary principles can inform innovation strategies without directly copying nature's implementation. This framework has two levels:

The Logic/Symbolic level operates at a higher conceptual plane, focusing on capturing the fundamental goals and search strategies within the innovation process. This level explicitly addresses the what and why of innovation, while establishing clear connections to evolutionary principles such as adaptation, co-opted adaptation, and co-opted nonadaptation.

The Algorithmic level delves into the practical implementation details, concentrating on the specific processes and methodologies involved in innovation execution. This level emphasizes the how of innovation by translating broad evolutionary principles into concrete business methods and actionable strategies.

### Pros and Cons

The Ford Model T version offers several advantages, including its historical perspective that provides a complete and well-documented story, along with its focused innovation in mass production that is widely understood across various industries, making it easier to demonstrate clear contrasts in uncertainty levels. However, this version has drawbacks such as being from a different company than other examples, potentially less relevant historical context, and industry dynamics that differ from modern cases.

The Tesla Model S version maintains consistency by featuring the same company throughout the examples and provides a more relatable modern context while demonstrating Tesla's evolving innovation approach and direct connection to the Roadster narrative.
