abstract: How does the fact that entrepreneurs choose the opportunity they pursue impact entrepreneurial strategy and performance? Entrepreneurs, while dealing with opportunities whose outcome is inherently uncertain, have choices that must be premised on a belief that the opportunity is worth pursuing. This insight provides an organizing principle for a Bayesian approach to entrepreneurial decision-making. A Bayesian approach offers a natural formal framework to assess how entrepreneurs form beliefs about the prospects for a given opportunity, how these beliefs evolve over time through active experimentation and learning, and the consequences of such beliefs for entrepreneurial strategy and performance. The goal is to shape distinctive implications and empirical approaches to the study of entrepreneurship guided by founding premises. The first premise is that the entrepreneur must be relatively optimistic about the opportunity relative to others. This involves a distinct theory that translates into a different perspective on the opportunity‚Äôs prospects. Second, this systematic divergence in beliefs impacts how an entrepreneur will undertake learning about an opportunity. Notably, the demand for ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù is fundamentally influenced by beliefs about the opportunity. For example, relative to a disinterested agent, a Bayesian entrepreneur will conduct experiments that are more likely to allow for ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù than ‚Äúfalse negatives.‚Äù Finally, this approach promotes the processes by which entrepreneurs are able to attract resources and capabilities by providing information to other agents. Entrepreneurs are more likely to convince those who share their idiosyncratically optimistic beliefs about an opportunity (with implications for homophily and firm culture), yet will also engage in choosing experiments that cater to those with different (more negative) beliefs than they themselves hold.

**A Note on Figures:**

- As in #üóÑÔ∏èexample1/#üóÑÔ∏èexample2, you can embed relevant figures (plots or diagrams) illustrating decision models (e.g., ‚Äúlow-bar‚Äù vs. ‚Äúhigh-bar‚Äù experiments) or showing how priors and posteriors evolve. If none are finalized, simply note ‚ÄúNone‚Äù or ‚ÄúTBD‚Äù in the last column.

Use (and modify) the above table as a concise roadmap for your manuscript. If you need further breakdowns (e.g., multiple subsections per row) or prefer the #üóÑÔ∏èexample2 format with ‚ÄúKey Literature / Key Message / Technical Details,‚Äù simply adapt these headings to match your preference.
