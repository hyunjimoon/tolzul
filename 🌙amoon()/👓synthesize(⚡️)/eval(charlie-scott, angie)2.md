### Why

Machine partners excel in four key functions of decision-making, that can be applied to every stage of organization willing to innovate. 

1. 👁️ Choosing Relevant States: Machines can process diverse, high-dimensional data much faster and more accurately than humans, capturing subtle patterns and relationships. This is crucial in complex market dynamics and real-time data streams.

   - Nail Stage: Identifying relevant market conditions and investor sentiment for SAFE terms decisions.
   - Scale Stage: Analyzing market data and production capabilities to determine states for market-product fit and sourcing strategy.
   - Sail Stage: Processing airport operations data and AV technology specs to identify relevant states for adoption decisions.



4. 🤝 Estimating Commitment Effect: Machines can consistently track and update complex state spaces, accurately modeling the long-term impacts of decisions. This is essential in dynamic environments with frequent state changes, evolving market conditions, and complex stakeholder relationships.

   - Nail Stage: Projecting future funding rounds and equity dilution based on chosen SAFE terms and current market state.
   - Scale Stage: Forecasting long-term market position and production scalability given the chosen market-product and sourcing strategy.
   - Sail Stage: Predicting long-term operational efficiency and stakeholder relationships resulting from the AV adoption decision.
