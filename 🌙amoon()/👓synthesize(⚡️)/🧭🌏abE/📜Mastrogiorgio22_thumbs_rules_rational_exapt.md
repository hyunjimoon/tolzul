The literatures on bounded and ecological rationality are built on adaptationism and its associated modular, cognitivist and computational paradigm‚Äîthat does not address or explain the evolutionary origins of rationality. We argue that the adaptive mechanisms of evolution are not sufÔ¨Åcient for explaining human rationality, and we posit that human rationality presents exaptive origins, where exaptations are traits evolved for other functions or no function at all, and later co-opted for new uses. We propose an embodied reconceptualization of rationality‚Äîembodied rationality‚Äîbased on the reuse of the perception-action system, where many neural processes involved in the control of the sensory-motor system, salient in ancestral environments have been later co-opted to create‚Äîby tinkering‚Äîhigh-level reasoning processes, employed in civilized niches.

Keywords: exaptation, embodied rationality, bounded rationality, heuristics, neural reuse, spandrels

| Aspect                        | Paper 1: Is Rationality an Exaptation?                                                                                                                                                                            | Paper 2: Resource Origins and Search                                                                                                                                   |

| **Main Argument**             | - Rationality may be an exaptation (reuse of evolved traits) rather than pure adaptation                                                                                                                          | - Resource search is guided by firm-specific search images that enable recognition of dormant value                                                                    |
| **Model Relevance**           | Connection to Quality Cascade: <br> - Initial sensory-motor qualities are repurposed for higher cognitive functions <br> - Perception-action system gets co-opted for new uses                                    | Connection to Quality Cascade: <br> - Search images shape initial Quality of Meaning <br> - Problem formulation guides the quality development process                 |
| **Strengths**                 | - Strong theoretical foundation in biology <br> - Clear distinction between adaptation/exaptation/spandrel <br> - Rich examples from biology and cognition                                                        | - Practical mechanism for resource search <br> - Explains how firms can "hack" efficient markets <br> - Links problem formulation to resource discovery                |
| **Limitations**               | - Could benefit from cognitive model to explain: <br>  ‚Ä¢ How quality transfers occur in exaptation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Role of feedback loops in functional shifts <br>  ‚Ä¢ Time dynamics of repurposing                       | - Could strengthen theory by: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Modeling different initial quality states <br>  ‚Ä¢ Explaining variation in flow rates <br>  ‚Ä¢ Incorporating feedback loop effects |
| **Integration Opportunities** | Add to model: <br> - Quality transfer mechanisms <br> - Multiple parallel quality cascades <br> - Cross-function feedback loops                                                                                   | Add to model: <br> - Search image formation process <br> - Problem-quality relationships <br> - Market feedback effects                                                |
| **Case Application**          | Model could help explain: <br> - Tesla: How battery expertise qualities transfer to new domain <br> - Porsche: How brand qualities get repurposed <br> - BYD: How structural qualities create unexpected benefits | Model already explains: <br> - How Tesla saw battery opportunities <br> - How Porsche recognized brand value <br> - How BYD discovered structural advantages           |
| **Future Research**           | - How do initial qualities affect exaptation potential? <br> - What determines quality transfer success? <br> - Role of feedback in stabilizing new functions                                                     | - How do search images evolve? <br> - What affects quality development rates? <br> - How do market conditions shape feedback?                                          |
| **Practical Implications**    | - Organizations should look for repurposing opportunities of existing qualities <br> - Consider unintended benefits of structural solutions <br> - Value may emerge from quality transfers                        | - Firms should actively develop search images <br> - Problem formulation shapes resource discovery <br> - External search can be focused through qualities             |
