| Aspect              | Object Petit a (Black House)                               | BYD Blade Battery                                              |

| Initial Structure   | Abandoned house creating forbidden space                   | Safety requirements creating blade form                        |
| Nature of Void      | Empty physical space that enables projection               | Structural pattern that enables new configurations             |
| Projection Process  | Community projects memories/desires onto space             | Engineers project manufacturing possibilities onto form        |
| Circulation Pattern | Stories/memories circulate around void                     | Production ideas circulate around structural pattern           |
| Value Emergence     | Space gains value through projected meanings               | Form gains value through projected manufacturing possibilities |
| Discovery Process   | Not through direct intention but through void's enablement | Not through direct design but through structural enablement    |
| Transformation      | "Nothing" becomes meaningful through projection            | "Constraint" becomes advantage through projection              |
