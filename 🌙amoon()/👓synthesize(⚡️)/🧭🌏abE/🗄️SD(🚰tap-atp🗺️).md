reasoning behind choice among is in [choosing naming for angie's model cld](https://claude.ai/chat/8bde447c-32cb-427a-985a-c448dddcf88e)
1. üß†1: Quality of Working Theory **üß†2: Quality of Programmatic Theory** üß†3: Quality of Validated Theory 
2. ü§ú1: Quality of Strategic Choice **ü§ú2: Quality of Strategic Framework**
3. üí®1: diffusing üí®2: market_feedback 
4. R2-1: Refining Theory R2-2: Validating Theory R2-3: Integrating Theory


> 1. For the first set of names, I would choose "Quality of Programmatic Theory" because:
- "Quality of Working Theory" is too preliminary/tentative sounding for management/engineering audience
- "Quality of Programmatic Theory" best aligns with Cronin's core argument about programmatic theory being the key driver of knowledge systems
- "Quality of Validated Theory" emphasizes validation but misses the integration aspect
6. For the second set, I would choose "Quality of Strategic Framework" because:
- "Quality of Strategic Choice" suggests individual decisions rather than systematic approach
- "Quality of Strategic Framework" better captures the structured/architectural nature of knowledge that Cronin advocates
7. For the third set, I would choose "market_feedback" because:
- "diffusing" is too passive/generic and doesn't capture the interactive nature
- "market_feedback" better represents the bidirectional exchange between theory and practice that Cronin describes
8. For the fourth set, I would maintain all three as distinct stages ("Refining Theory", "Validating Theory", "Integrating Theory") because:
