## What Car Companies Can Teach Us About Seeing the Improbable Possible 🚗

### Introduction: More Than Meets the Eye
"Hey, what would you do with a car battery on a desert island?" 

Most people laugh and say "Nothing - there's no car!" But here's where it gets interesting. That battery? It could be your ticket home! Its shiny surface could signal rescue planes. Its components could help purify water. And if you're clever like our innovation heroes, you might discover even more surprising uses.
### Meet Our Innovation Heroes
Let me introduce you to three fascinating characters who discovered different ways of unlocking hidden potential in everyday things:

1. **Tesla Tom - The Mountain Climber** 🏔️
"I'm going to build the best EV battery in the world!" Tom declared, pulling out his methodical checklist. One step at a time, Tom climbed his mountain:
- Monday: Test battery chemistry
- Tuesday: Improve thermal management
- Wednesday: Optimize charging...
"It's not exciting," Tom grins, "but every step gets us closer to the summit!"

2. **Power Pam - The Genius Multi-tasker** 🔄
Pam was working on car batteries when she had her lightbulb moment. "Wait a minute... if this can power a car, why not a house?" 
While others saw a car part, Pam saw a revolution in home energy. She didn't just think outside the box - she turned the box into something entirely new!
"The best part?" Pam laughs, "We already knew how to make great batteries. We just had to imagine them differently!"

3. **BYD Bob - The Accidental Revolutionary** ⚡
"Honestly? It started with me just trying not to blow things up," Bob chuckles. He was focused on making safer batteries when he stumbled onto something amazing:
"Hey team, look at this! Our safety design actually makes manufacturing cheaper!"
"Wait... and it fits EVs perfectly?"
"Hold on - these performance numbers can't be right... they're too good!"

### How Did Bob Do It?
"People call me a genius," Bob says modestly, "but really, I was just like a kid with a new Swiss Army knife - constantly discovering new uses nobody planned for." Bob's secret sauce? 1) Stay curious about accidents, 2) Test crazy ideas (even the "wrong" ones), 3) Let surprises guide you, 4) Connect dots others ignore. "The fascinating thing is," Bob explains, "just like how a Swiss Army knife has blades you might never use, our battery design had hidden capabilities we never imagined. We started with safety, but then discovered: the blade-like structure made manufacturing super efficient, the same design made the battery pack lighter, it actually made the whole car safer in crashes, and it could fit more cells in the same space!"

"That's the beauty of functional excess," Bob concludes. "The potential was always there - we just had to be open to discovering it."

These are evolution stories of Tesla's EV battery, Tesla's Powerwall, and BYD Blade Battery.

## 1. Three Evolution Patterns with Transportation Examples


This theoretical comparison reveals two fundamental tensions in innovation theory. First, between deterministic optimization (Dennett) and emergent discovery (Teppo & Stuart), reflected in how different approaches balance exploration versus exploitation. Second, between sequential processes (Dennett) and parallel discovery (von Hippel), manifesting in how organizations structure their innovation activities.

The tension between deterministic optimization and emergent discovery challenges traditional assumptions about innovation development. Dennett's adaptationist perspective argues that traits evolve for specific, predetermined functions through optimization. However, our automotive industry cases demonstrate how innovations often emerge through unexpected pathways. Tesla's battery development exemplifies Dennett's sequential optimization model, while BYD's Blade Battery reveals Teppo & Stuart's concept of functional excess, where multiple valuable functions emerge through parallel exploration.

The tension between sequential and parallel processes manifests in how organizations structure their innovation activities. Von Hippel's need-solution pair framework suggests that when search costs are low, needs and solutions can be discovered simultaneously. This insight is complemented by Gershenfeld's "Ready-Fire-Aim" approach, which emphasizes learning from productive failures through rapid, parallel experimentation. Together, these perspectives explain why organizations shift from sequential to parallel approaches when implementation time exceeds testing time.

Our key contributions:
- A framework unifying three distinct evolutionary patterns: functional adaptation, functional shift, and co-option
- A temporal ordering typology showing how implementation time ratios, feedback cycles, and development rates determine optimal innovation patterns
- Integration of Kauffman's Theory of Adjacent Possible to explain transitions between evolutionary patterns based on combinatorial opportunities

The power of this framework lies in explaining how different temporal orderings between observation, testing, and commitment lead to distinct innovation outcomes. Sequential adaptation excels at optimizing clear primary functions, as seen in Tesla's initial battery development. Parallel processing enables leveraging existing features for new purposes, demonstrated by Tesla's Powerwall. Parallel discovery uncovers entirely new functions in structural byproducts, exemplified by BYD's Blade Battery's unexpected manufacturing advantages.

Our temporal ordering typology provides concrete guidance for matching innovation patterns to situational parameters. When implementation time exceeds testing time, organizations benefit from shifting to parallel approaches. When combinatorial opportunities are high, functional excess becomes more valuable than single-function optimization. These patterns manifest through three evolutionary models, each optimized for different combinations of implementation time ratios, feedback cycles, and development rates.

This research introduces a novel theoretical framework for understanding innovation through three distinct pathways of discovery, challenging traditional views that emphasize singular, optimized functions. Drawing from automotive industry cases, we identify sequential adaptation (where observation leads to testing and then theory), parallel processing (where observation triggers simultaneous testing and theory development), and parallel discovery (where all three processes occur concurrently). This framework reveals how innovation emerges not just through deliberate optimization, but through various patterns of recognizing and harnessing functional potential.

The power of this framework lies in its ability to explain how different temporal orderings and interactions between testing among observable, implementing among perceptual programs (theories), and diffusing commitments lead to distinct innovation outcomes. While sequential adaptation excels at optimizing clear primary functions (as seen in Tesla's battery development), parallel processing enables the leveraging of existing features for new purposes (demonstrated by Tesla's Powerwall), and parallel discovery uncovers entirely new functions in structural byproducts (exemplified by BYD's Blade Battery). These patterns demonstrate how breakthrough innovations often emerge from discovering and exploiting the latent capabilities inherent in existing technologies, rather than merely optimizing known functions.

Table ![[🗄️📜🌱🦅🐠]] positions our research - it challenges Dennett's traditional adaptationist view that "a trait's proper function is what it was designed for," instead aligning with more expansive perspectives on innovation emergence. While Dennett's framework suggests innovation occurs through optimizing predetermined functions, we demonstrate how different temporal orderings and parallel processes enable broader innovation pathways. This theoretical tension manifests clearly in our case studies: Tesla's battery development follows Dennett's sequential optimization model, while BYD's Blade Battery exemplifies  [[📜Felin23_disrupt_evol]]'s concept of functional excess where multiple valuable functions emerge through parallel exploration.

The integration of Gershenfeld's "Ready-Fire-Aim" approach and von Hippel's need-solution pair framework enriches our understanding of how different innovation patterns emerge. Gershenfeld emphasizes learning from productive failures, suggesting that unexpected outcomes drive innovation, while von Hippel argues that needs and solutions can be discovered simultaneously when search costs are low. Together, these perspectives support our framework's emphasis on varying temporal orderings of understanding development, theory testing, and strategic implementation across different contexts.

Our temporal ordering typology, grounded in Kauffman's Theory of Adjacent Possible, provides concrete guidance for matching innovation patterns to situational parameters. When implementation time exceeds testing time (timp > ttest), organizations should shift from Dennett's sequential optimization to parallel approaches. When combinatorial opportunities are high (high α), Teppo & Stuart's functional excess becomes more valuable than single-function optimization. These patterns manifest through three evolutionary models - functional adaptation, functional shift, and co-option - each optimized for different combinations of implementation time ratios, feedback cycles, and development rates.

Our research reveals two fundamental tensions in innovation theory that shape how organizations structure their innovation activities. First, between deterministic optimization (Dennett's view that "a trait's proper function is what it was designed for") and emergent discovery (Teppo & Stuart's concept of "functional excess"), reflected in how organizations balance exploration versus exploitation. Second, between sequential processes and parallel discovery, manifesting in how organizations time and structure their innovation activities. These tensions directly inform our Understanding-Theory-Commitments (UTC) framework, where different temporal orderings and parallel processes enable broader innovation pathways.

The integration of Gershenfeld's "Ready-Fire-Aim" approach and von Hippel's need-solution pair framework helps explain when organizations should shift between sequential and parallel processes. Gershenfeld emphasizes learning from productive failures through rapid implementation cycles, while von Hippel argues that simultaneous need-solution discovery becomes viable when search costs are low. This explains why organizations shift from sequential to parallel approaches when implementation time exceeds testing time (timp > ttest), and why feedback loops become crucial when combinatorial opportunities are high (high α).

Our temporal ordering typology, grounded in Kauffman's Theory of Adjacent Possible, translates these theoretical tensions into actionable guidance through three evolutionary patterns: functional adaptation (sequential UTC), functional shift (parallel theory development), and co-option (complex feedback systems). Tesla's battery development exemplifies Dennett's sequential optimization approach, while BYD's Blade Battery demonstrates Teppo & Stuart's emergent discovery process where multiple valuable functions emerge through parallel exploration, showcasing how organizations can systematically evolve their innovation processes based on their context.



## 2. Understanding-Theory-Commitments (UTC) Model 

![[Pasted image 20241201202758.png]]
Our model begins with functional adaptation as the baseline evolutionary pattern, where quality of perceptive understanding (U1), programmatic theory (T1), and strategic commitments (C1) follow a simple sequential process (U1→T1→C1). When implementation time exceeds testing time ($t_{imp} > t_{test}$), organizations benefit from shifting to parallel theory development, changing from sequential adaptation's 1:1:1 UTC ratio to a 1:2:1 structure in functional shift. This transition is visually captured in the progression from the baseline U1→T1→C1 model to the functional shift pattern U1→T2→C1, where T2 represents expanded theoretical development occurring in parallel.

The model then addresses two types of exaptation that deviate from simple sequential evolution. Functional shift, shown as U1→T2→C1, maintains sequential understanding and commitment processes while enabling parallel theory development. In contrast, co-option emerges when the diffusion time ($t_{diff}$) decreases, transforming the causal model into a complex system with feedback loops. This shift is visualized in the diagram through the addition of feedback arrows from C1 back to U1, representing how strategic commitments generate new perceptual understanding. BYD's Blade Battery exemplifies this pattern, where initial safety-focused development created feedback loops that revealed unexpected manufacturing advantages.

Kauffman's Theory of Adjacent Possible manifests in our model through the α parameters that govern transition conditions. When theory development rate exceeds commitment rate (α2↑α3↓), the T/C ratio increases, favoring parallel processing. When understanding growth rate increases (α1↑), the U/C ratio rises, enabling parallel discovery. The final transition occurs when the relative rates between understanding and theory (α2↓αT↑) shift, suggesting a switch in their sequential ordering. These transitions, shown in the bottom progression of the diagram, explain how organizations evolve from simple sequential processes to more complex parallel architectures based on their underlying rates of change.

summary of [[🗄️SD(🚰tap-atp🗺️)]]



Our system dynamics model builds on [[📜Kauffman22_theory_of_adj_possible]]s Theory of Adjacent Possible through three essential stock variables that drive innovation evolution. The Quality of Perceptive Understanding represents the foundation of possible innovations, paralleling Kauffman's Mt term that captures the number of available elements. The Quality of Programmatic Theory embodies successful combinations of these elements, corresponding to Kauffman's ∑αi(Mt choose i) term that describes how new innovations emerge. The Quality of Strategic Framework represents the surviving and implemented innovations, reflecting Kauffman's Mt(1-μ) term that accounts for retention of valuable solutions.

These stock variables interact through three distinct evolutionary patterns, each demonstrating different aspects of Kauffman's mathematical framework. Tesla's battery development exemplifies functional adaptation through sequential progression, where testing leads to theory development and then implementation. The Powerwall demonstrates functional shift through parallel processing, where testing and theory development occur simultaneously before implementation. BYD's Blade Battery illustrates co-option through parallel discovery, where understanding, testing, and theory development happen concurrently, leading to unexpected benefits.

The model's reinforcing loops (Learning and Refining Theory) and balancing loops (Rejecting and Retiring Theory) create the conditions for what Kauffman describes as "bubbling forth" of new possibilities. The Learning loop enables the discovery of functional possibilities, while the Refining Theory loop strengthens successful implementations. The Rejecting loop drives the elimination of invalid understandings, and the Retiring Theory loop pushes the retirement of obsolete frameworks. These dynamics explain how organizations like Tesla, BYD, and Porsche navigate the complex landscape of innovation possibilities, turning theoretical potential into practical value.

## 3. Application to three examples

### 3.1 Implementation vs Testing Time (Sequential to Parallel)

When implementation time significantly exceeds testing time (high $\color{Red}t_{imp}$/$\color{green}t_{test}$ ratio), organizations should shift from sequential to parallel theory development. This ratio becomes particularly important in industries with substantial physical manufacturing requirements, where each implementation cycle requires significant time and resources compared to theoretical testing phases. The parallel approach allows organizations to develop multiple theoretical frameworks simultaneously while managing long implementation cycles.

Tesla's battery development journey illustrates this transition. Initially following sequential adaptation (U1→T1→C1) for Model S batteries, Tesla shifted to parallel theory development (U1→T2→C1) for Model 3's 4680 cells when they realized implementation time (factory setup, production line configuration) far exceeded testing time (cell chemistry validation). This parallel approach enabled simultaneous development of cell chemistry, thermal management, and manufacturing processes while managing the lengthy implementation cycles of Gigafactory scaling.

### 3.2 Feedback Time (Causal to Complex)

Organizations should transition from causal to complex models when feedback from strategic commitments significantly influences perceptual understanding. This manifests in highly interconnected systems where outcomes rapidly generate new insights. The feedback loops create opportunities for discovering unexpected functional possibilities, particularly in markets with strong interconnections between products, processes, and customer needs.

BYD's Blade Battery development exemplifies this transition. The initial causal model focused on safety improvements, but rapid feedback from manufacturing (shorter $\color{#C0A0C0}t_{rec.}$) revealed unexpected structural and cost advantages. The complex feedback loops (C1→U1) enabled BYD to discover how their safety-focused design simultaneously improved manufacturing efficiency, thermal management, and cost structure - benefits that weren't initially theorized but emerged through implementation feedback.

### 3.3 Theory Development Rate (Shift vs Co-option)

When the ratio of understanding growth rate to feedback reception time ($\color{#C0A0C0}α_1$ / $\color{#C0A0C0}t_{rec.}$) is high, organizations should favor co-option over planned functional shift. This occurs particularly in luxury markets and integral architectures where diverse functional needs must be satisfied simultaneously, and rapid feedback enables quick recognition of emergent possibilities.

Porsche's Turbo brand evolution demonstrates this principle. Rather than just shifting their performance branding from ICE to EV (functional shift), Porsche discovered through rapid market feedback how the Turbo designation could serve unexpected functions in EV positioning. The high $\color{#C0A0C0}α_1$ enabled them to quickly recognize and capitalize on how the Turbo brand could signal premium positioning beyond just performance metrics, leading to co-option of the term for broader market segmentation.

### 3.4 Theory vs Understanding Rates (Sequence Optimization)

The ratio of theory to understanding evolution rates ($\color{green}α_2$ $\color{#C0A0C0}\mu_1$/$\color{green}\mu_2$$\color{#C0A0C0}α_1$) determines optimal sequencing between theory-first and understanding-first approaches. When theory development outpaces understanding accumulation, organizations benefit from beginning with theoretical exploration. This typically occurs when solutions evolve slowly but needs change rapidly.

Tesla's early Powerwall development illustrates this sequencing decision. With high theory development rate relative to understanding accumulation (high $\color{green}α_2$/$\color{#C0A0C0}α_1$), Tesla began with theoretical development of energy storage systems before fully understanding residential energy market needs. 🚨This theory-first approach enabled them to leverage existing battery expertise while market understanding evolved, contrasting with their later understanding-first approach in markets where customer needs evolved more slowly than technical solutions 🚨.

With [[Cronin_SAJ.pdf]]'s lens, our system dynamics model reveals three foundational pairings that drive innovation through distinct collaborative processes and their products. The Artist-Scientist collaboration (👁️→🧠) enables discovery and possibility through testing processes, where imagination of potential truths combines with scientific verification to uncover previously unknown aspects of situations. This process manifests in our model's testing cycle, where perceptive understanding leads to programmatic theory development. The Scientist-Judge pairing (🧠→🤜) creates skill and meaning through implementing processes, where scientific understanding of how situations operate combines with judicial evaluation of costs and benefits to enable effective goal achievement. This emerges in our model's implementing cycle from programmatic theory to strategic framework. The Judge-Artist pairing (🤜→👁️) generates vision and hope through receiving feedback, where evaluation of current realities combines with imagination of better futures to motivate pursuit of goals despite uncertainty. This manifests in our model's feedback cycle connecting strategic framework back to perceptive understanding. Each pairing produces both an immediate output (discovery, skill, vision) and a deeper foundation (possibility, meaning, hope) that shapes how organizations navigate innovation landscapes.

[[📜Nelson61_uc_learn_econ]] 's parallel R&D framework complements these SAJ dynamics by explaining when to multiply each type of collaborative pairing. The optimal number of parallel paths depends on balancing development costs against improved decision-making from accumulated information. Our framework extends this insight by distinguishing two types of parallelism: parallel processing (multiple programmatic theories testing the same understanding, as in functional shift) and parallel discovery (multiple instances of discovery processes running simultaneously, as in co-option). The ratio of implementation to development time (timp/ttest) determines when to add parallel theory paths for Scientist-Judge skill development, while the ratio of understanding growth to feedback time (αu/treceive) indicates when to pursue parallel Artist-Scientist discovery processes.

These theoretical foundations explain how successful organizations orchestrate SAJ collaborations across different timescales. Tesla's battery development began with sequential Scientist-Judge collaboration to build skill and meaning, before expanding to parallel Artist-Scientist processes for discovery and possibility as implementation costs grew. BYD's Blade Battery success emerged from parallel Judge-Artist vision generation enabled by rapid feedback cycles, showcasing how shortened receiving feedback time (low treceive) can reveal unexpected possibilities that fuel hope. This progression demonstrates how organizations evolve their innovation processes by dynamically adjusting the balance and sequencing of SAJ collaborations based on underlying timescales, evolution rates, and opportunity landscapes.

## 4. Prescription

🚨🚨🚨🚨 todo4: walk readers through [[🗄️💊]] table and write each row as two paragraphs in sec. 3.1 to 3.4 below. MAKE SURE no information is left out from the table when you're explaining. add some transportation examples (Tesla, BYD, Porsche) we've been building as readers are fans of them. 

![[🗄️💊]]
### 3.1 time cost
Based on row 1's reasoning, we recommend parallel over sequential approaches when execution time greatly exceeds theory development time (high t_exec/t_dev ratio). This ratio is evident in the execution_time versus theory_development_time components of our system dynamics model, where execution time represents the Implementation Cycle Driver while theory development represents the Development Cycle Driver. Parameters favor parallel when execution involves extensive physical manufacturing (like BYD's battery production, where 👆implementing requires significant production infrastructure) and are low when execution can happen quickly (like software updates).

BYD's Blade Battery development illustrates this dynamic through its Quality of Working Theory (🧠) and implementing (👆) flows. The manufacturing execution time was significant - involving new production lines, worker training, and quality control systems. This long execution cycle compared to relatively faster theory development around safety and design principles made parallel development optimal, as shown by the execution/development time ratio in our model. The case shows BYD running multiple production lines simultaneously rather than sequential testing, supported by strong reinforcing loops between theory (RT) and understanding (RU) that enabled efficient parallel development.

### 3.2 diverse needs

Based on row 2's reasoning, we recommend co-option over functional shift when combinatoric needs are high (high α_o), meaning multiple diverse functions must be fulfilled simultaneously. This manifests in our model through the Quality of Imaginative Understanding (👁️) component, where higher understanding fitness enables recognition of multiple potential applications. Parameters favor parallel when serving luxury/premium markets with complex multi-dimensional requirements (as shown in the Quality of Strategic Choice 🤜 component) and are low when addressing commoditized, single-function needs.

BYD's Blade Battery demonstrates this combinatoric complexity through strong reinforcing loops (RU: Understanding Reinforcement). Initially designed for safety, the structural design unexpectedly satisfied multiple diverse needs through the diffusing_impact (💨) flow - manufacturing efficiency, thermal management, and cost reduction. This was enabled by high Quality of Working Theory (🧠) that could support multiple parallel innovations. The case shows how these diverse requirements were discovered through parallel exploration rather than sequential adaptation, supported by the model's Understanding Balancing (BU) loop that allowed rapid evolution of understanding as new possibilities emerged.

For Porsche's "Turbo" branding evolution, the complex interplay between theoretical dimensions - performance definition, luxury brand heritage, and market positioning - required simultaneous theoretical development. Like Tesla's "Design in California, Manufacture Overseas" philosophy colliding with Lotus's sequential approach, Porsche navigated multiple conflicting theoretical frameworks simultaneously rather than sequentially.

For Porsche's "Turbo" branding evolution, the complex interplay between theoretical dimensions is evident through the model's Theory Reinforcement (RT) loop. Performance definition, luxury brand heritage, and market positioning required simultaneous theoretical development in the Quality of Working Theory (🧠) component. Like Tesla's "Design in California, Manufacture Overseas" philosophy colliding with Lotus's sequential approach, Porsche navigated multiple conflicting theoretical frameworks simultaneously rather than sequentially. This was supported by strong Understanding Reinforcement (RU) loops that enabled rapid learning across different market segments and brand positions, while the Theory Balancing (BT) loop helped maintain coherence between legacy ICE branding and new EV performance signaling.
### 3.3 interdependence

Tesla's battery development demonstrates high correlation between theoretical domains through the Theory Reinforcement (RT) loop in our model. The case shows how safety design principles, manufacturing processes, and thermal management were deeply interdependent in the Quality of Working Theory (🧠) - when engineers had to retrofit parts to compensate for both weaknesses in design and manufacturing challenges, requiring all batteries to flow through California engineering labs before production. This tight coupling is represented in the model's theory_development_time component.

Based on row 3's reasoning, we recommend 2D over 1D exploration when diffusion time is short (high 1/t_diffusing), indicating tightly coupled systems where changes cascade rapidly through the diffusing_impact (💨) flow. This is evident in the model's Feedback Cycle Driver, where strategic choices quickly generate new understanding. Parameters favor parallel when dealing with integral architectures in incumbent/oligopoly markets (shown by strong Theory Balancing BT loops) and are low in modular systems or entrant markets where feedback cycles are longer.

### 3.4 decay and combinatorial coefficient
Based on row 4's reasoning, we recommend push over pull strategies when the ratio of Quality of Working Theory (🧠) evolution speed to Quality of Imaginative Understanding (👁️) speed is high. This is parameterized as $\frac{\alpha_p \mu_o}{\mu_p \alpha_o}$.  in our model through the decaying_understanding_fitness (μ_u) and decaying_theory_effectiveness (μ_t) components, occurring when solutions evolve slowly while needs change rapidly. Parameters favor parallel when solutions are uncertain/slowly evolving (high theory decay rate) and market needs are homogeneous/fast-changing (high understanding decay rate).

Like Tesla's shift from "Silicon Valley startup" outsourcing to vertical integration preference, Porsche faced rapid decay in ICE performance theory (μ_t) as EV disruption accelerated. The case shows their working theory about "Turbo" lost effectiveness through the Theory Balancing (BT) loop in an electric context, requiring parallel development of new theories connecting heritage brand value to EV performance measures through the Theory Reinforcement (RT) loop. This allowed valuable combinations between legacy brand theory and EV market theory to emerge through the model's Understanding Reinforcement (RU) loop.

Sequential Adaptation (🌱) follows a linear progression (👁️ → 👓 → 🧠 → 👆 → 🤜) with high time cost (k⋅⏱️T + r⋅⏱️T) but thorough learning. It conducts single-domain observations ($S_1 \sim P(S|D)$) through four test-implement iterations, where each iteration informs the next. Tesla's battery development exemplifies this pattern, optimizing one aspect at a time under low uncertainty and implementation costs, trading speed for depth of learning.

Parallel Processing (🦅) combines theory development and testing (👁️ → (🧠 + 👓) → 👆 → 🤜), achieving moderate time efficiency through overlapping stages. It conducts related parallel tests ($S_{1, 2} \sim P(S|D)$) across two test-implement iterations, leveraging existing knowledge across domains. Tesla's Powerwall demonstrates this approach by adapting EV battery technology for home storage, balancing knowledge reuse with exploration under moderate uncertainty and costs.

Parallel Discovery (🐠) executes all initial stages simultaneously ((👁️ + 👓 + 🧠) → 👆 → 🤜), using just 2 samples with implementation time reduced to one-third of sequential cases, plus a 1.5x efficiency multiplier due to synergistic effects. It maintains multiple concurrent hypotheses ($S_{1, 2}^1 \sim P(S|D_1), S_{1, 2}^2 \sim P(S|D_2)$), achieving the highest potential utility through emergent discoveries. BYD's Blade Battery exemplifies this approach, where fewer but simultaneous tests yielded 50% higher utility through unexpected synergies across safety, cost, and design domains, while significantly reducing the implementation overhead per test.
