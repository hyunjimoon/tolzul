History and Technical Evolution: BYD's development of the Blade Battery began with a fundamental safety requirement for LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) chemistry. The distinctive blade-like structure (905mm x 118mm x 13.5mm) emerged as a response to safety constraints, but this structural necessity unexpectedly yielded multiple innovations. The battery achieved remarkable specifications (646.4 Wh per cell, 448 Wh/L density, >3,000 cycle life) not through direct optimization but through what the papers frame as "structural byproduct discovery." The cell-to-pack design eliminated traditional module sections, fundamentally changing battery architecture while meeting the original safety requirements.

Theoretical Connection: This development process mirrors Lacan's object petit a concept in several ways. Just as the "black house" in Žižek's analysis functions as an empty space that enables projection of desires, the blade structure's constraints created a productive void in battery design. The safety requirement acted like the physical structure of the "black house" - seemingly limiting but actually enabling new possibilities. What appeared as "nothing" (structural constraints) became "something" (multiple innovations) through the projection of engineering possibilities onto this structural void. This exemplifies what Felin and Kauffman (2023) call "functional excess" - where features emerge not from deliberate optimization but from exploring the empty spaces created by structural constraints. The blade structure represents a spandrel - an unintended architectural byproduct that gained new functions through discovery rather than design.

| Aspect                    | Technical Detail                        | Object Petit a / Spandrel Connection                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initial Safety Constraint | LFP chemistry choice for stability      | Like the "black house" structure, safety requirement created initial void/constraint |
| Physical Form             | 905mm x 118mm x 13.5mm blade shape      | The "structural byproduct" that became platform for innovation                       |
| Structural Spandrel       | Cell-to-pack design eliminating modules | Empty space between cells became functional advantage (like architectural spandrels) |
| Safety Performance        | No catching 🔥fire even when damaged    | Original constraint that shaped the "void"                                           |
| Energy Characteristics    | 646.4 Wh per cell, 448 Wh/L density     | Value emerged from structural pattern, not primary design goal                       |
| Manufacturing Innovation  | Thinner, longer cells (13.5mm width)    | Like how "black house" emptiness enabled new meanings                                |

| Material Efficiency       | LFP chemistry (non-toxic, simpler)      | Value emerging from limitation (like spandrel's decorative use)                      |
