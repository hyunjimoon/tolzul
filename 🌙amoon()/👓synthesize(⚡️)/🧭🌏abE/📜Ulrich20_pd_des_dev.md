| Generic <br> (Market-Pull) <br> Products | The team begins with a market opportunity and selects appropriate technologies to meet customer needs. | Process generally includes distinct planning, concept development, systemlevel design, detail design, testing and refinement, and production ramp-up phases. |             Sporting goods, furniture, tools.              |
|         Technology-Push Products         |                The team begins with a new technology, then finds an appropriate market.                |                           Planning phase involves matching technology and market. Concept development assumes a given technology.                            |            Gore-Tex rainwear, Tyvek envelopes.             |

|         Customized <br> Products         |                     New products are slight variations of existing configurations.                     |                                  Similarity of projects allows for a streamlined and highly structured development process.                                  |          Motors, switches, batteries, containers.          |

### üé≤ High-Risk Products

The product development process addresses various types of risk, including:
- **Technical risk** (Will the product function properly?),
- **Market risk** (Will customers respond positively to the developed product?), and
- **Budget and schedule risk** (Can the team complete the project on time and within budget?).

High-risk products involve substantial uncertainties related to technology or market, leading to significant technical or market risks. To mitigate these risks early, the generic product development process is adapted to address the largest risks in the initial stages. For example:
- **Market Uncertainty**: If customer acceptance is highly uncertain, concept testing with renderings or user-interface prototypes is conducted early to reduce market risk.
- **Technical Performance Uncertainty**: When there is high uncertainty about technical performance, building and testing working models of key features early in the process can help. Multiple solution paths may be explored simultaneously to increase the chances of a successful outcome.

Design reviews should regularly assess risk levels, ensuring that risks are systematically reduced rather than postponed.

### üèüÔ∏èComplex Systems

Large-scale products, like automobiles and airplanes, are complex systems composed of many interacting subsystems and components. When developing these complex systems, several system-level issues modify the generic product development process. Key aspects include:

- **Concept Development Phase**: This phase evaluates the architecture of the entire system, often considering multiple competing concepts for the overall system.
- **System-Level Design Phase**: During this phase, the system is broken down into subsystems and further into components, with dedicated teams assigned to develop each. Additional teams focus on the integration of components into subsystems and, ultimately, into the complete system.

Detail design of components occurs in parallel, with numerous development teams working independently. Systems engineering specialists manage the complex network of interactions among components and subsystems. The **testing and refinement phase** not only integrates components and subsystems but also includes extensive validation at all levels.
