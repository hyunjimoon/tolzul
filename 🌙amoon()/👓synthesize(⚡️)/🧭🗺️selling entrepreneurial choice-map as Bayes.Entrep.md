## 1. experiment design with bayesian workflow and low vs high bar 
- [Bayesian Workflow and Startup Operations](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/159#discussioncomment-7033951) and gps2navigation 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd45bc59-7d12-47c0-90f3-3a1f5799c7a7)
- vikash agreed [Testing Entrepreneurial Hypothesis and Experiment](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/159#discussioncomment-7149810)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea6bdb3-d24a-4e9f-ae37-733026ffd23d)

low and high bar theory is applied to my situation in https://github.com/Data4DM/Tool4Ops4Entrep/issues/21#issue-2360360735

### Entrepreneurial experiments and their success measures.

- conducting low BAR experiments in entrepreneurship is important, which are easy to pass and provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn't.

- people often understand how to interpret low BAR experiments differently than high BAR experiments, with low BAR experiments providing affirmation and high BAR experiments providing the truth.

- importance of experimentation in product development, highlighting the value of minimal viable products (MVPs) in reducing false positives and startups.

- the concept of "high BAR" experiments, which require minimal effort and provide valuable insights into customer preferences. (??)

### Optimizing experiments for entrepreneurs.

- Entrepreneurs prioritize low-bar experiments over high-bar experiments, despite potential biases.

- Speaker discusses the use of noise in decision-making, with a focus on the Bayesian approach. (??)

### Entrepreneurial optimism and experimentation.

- Entrepreneurs choose high bar experiments to convince investors, as they are more optimistic and want to maximize upside potential.

- Minimum Viable experiments are valuable for businesses and investors, as they provide convincing evidence and demonstrate potential for growth.

- Entrepreneurs' optimism influences likelihood of starting a venture, with lower probability of success for those who need to persuade others.

- Pioneer of experiments on unbiased data to gain insights, but challenges remain in interpreting results and understanding data-generating process.

**Summary of the Three Scott's Points:** from [experiment strategy conference](https://otter.ai/u/4fG5h9whQpy13i1kAomL-0_wFw0?utm_source=copy_url  ) which led to development of #249 

1. **Different Experiments for Self-Persuasion vs. Persuading Others:**
   - In a **contested environment** where beliefs and incentives differ, the experiments an entrepreneur conducts to convince themselves about their idea are fundamentally different from those aimed at persuading others.
   - Entrepreneurs are often **contrarian optimists**, using experiments to validate their own beliefs rather than to convince neutral or skeptical parties.
   - This creates a **profound tension** in optimal design because what convinces oneself may not be sufficient to persuade others.
   - The concept of **agency** is crucial here, as highlighted in the Bayesian entrepreneurship framework, emphasizing how personal beliefs shape experimental approaches.

2. **Disagreement vs. Incentive Misalignment in Optimal Design:**
   - The area of designing optimal strategies in environments where there is **belief disagreement** or differing incentives is vast and not well-understood.
   - When parties **disagree**, the challenge is to create designs that can bridge differing beliefs.
   - If the issue is **incentive misalignment**, the focus shifts to aligning interests to achieve mutual goals.
   - Understanding whether the core issue is **disagreement** or **incentive divergence** is essential for effective design in contested environments.

3. **Alignment of Contrarian Beliefs Leads to Investment:**
   - Entrepreneurs don't need to convince the **average investor**; instead, they seek investors who share their **contrarian optimism**.
   - The venture capital model, organized around equity, allows for efficient **sorting** between optimistic entrepreneurs and like-minded investors.
   - When an investor shares the entrepreneur's vision of **unlimited upside potential**, despite widespread skepticism, this alignment leads to investment.
   - This principle also applies to attracting **employees and partners** who are willing to commit because they share the same optimistic beliefs.

**Connecting to the Central Statement:**

The overarching theme across these points is the challenge of designing optimal strategies in a **contested environment**, where differing beliefs and incentives require careful consideration. Understanding whether the differences stem from **disagreement** or **incentive misalignment** is crucial for tailoring approaches that can effectively navigate these complexities. The alignment of beliefs, especially in entrepreneurial contexts, plays a significant role in forming successful collaborations and investments despite the contested nature of the environment.

#243 is prototype that competes human and near-optimal bayes - it's goal is to 
1. show belief update visually
2. enhance human's belief on machine though improved thought product

## 3. theory-driven/scientific approach/bayesnet with experiment infra
@mugamma was looking for bayes-net based causal logic structure 
- [todd zenger's slide](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16649003/2a.What.is.Bayesian.Entrepreneurship.-.Zenger.BEC.2024.pdf) mentions griffiths and tenenbaum's research on causal induction from small samples (i don't understand why todd is framing "bayes net to causal theory" - isn't bayesian workflow (inference, model checking, extension) with bayes net model, what causal model is?)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fad5a8b6-8a68-4093-96f8-b04c5086982d)
- tomas zellweger explained [here](https://cdmcd.co/JQJLvk) smith friston and josh tenenbaum's research to frame strategizing as active inference

to gain insights on enhancing game environments for `pivot-game` developed in #243 , I played Bocconi univ.'s [theory building games](https://imsl.unibocconi.it/play/). arnaldo shared his hope to add multi-armed bandit (which was suggested in chat with @mugamma) and graphical belief representation which i feel prob.prog. can contribute (arnaldo said he'd discuss with scott on ways mit and bocconi team can collaborate)

JB who has expertise on porsche helped me play porshce theory building game -  @jeanbaptiste may i ask for your input on below four probabilities - reason we couldn't proceed the game was because we further need to set probability on the edge:
