## Table 1: Definition and example of Four Axioms of Entrepreneurial Strategy

| Axiom | Definition | Combined Examples |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Freedom | There is more than one potential path to create and capture value from an idea | - Starbucks: Howard Schultz's cafe idea vs. original founders' coffee bean business<br>- Amazon: Jeff Bezos exploring multiple verticals before choosing books<br>- 23andMe: Considering consumer-focused ancestry research vs. enhancing prenatal genetic screening |
| Constraint | An entrepreneur cannot pursue all these paths at the same time | - The Body Shop: Anita Roddick choosing ethical products over animal testing<br>- RapidSOS: Focusing on enhancing 911 services rather than creating a standalone app<br>- Pillpack: Choosing to build their own pharmacy instead of licensing their design to established pharmacies |
| Uncertainty | Entrepreneurs are uncertain about the value of particular strategies but also the range of value that might result from their idea | - Amazon: Jeff Bezos's systematic search across multiple industries before settling on books<br>- Biobot Analytics: Uncertainty about which data from sewers would be most valuable to measure and for whom<br>- Gimlet: Uncertainty about the best way to revolutionize the podcast industry |
| Noisy Learning | Learning is noisy and ongoing so finding out more about one route often allows a reassessment of other alternatives | - ThirdLove: Discovery of the need for half-size bras through customer feedback and experimentation<br>- 23andMe: Iterative learning about consumer preferences in genetic testing and health information<br>- RapidSOS: Ongoing learning about emergency response needs leading to pivots in their technology approach |

## Table 3: Categorization and Definition of Key Choices in Entrepreneurial Strategy

| Error Type | Value Domain | Uncertainty Components | Definitions |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Statistical Error | Value Creation | Customer | Any person, group or organization who will pay the startup money for any of its goods or services. Uncertainty arises from unpredictable customer preferences and behaviors. |
| | | Technology | The tools, techniques, designs and knowledge used by a business to create practical value for consumers. Technological uncertainty arises from inherent architectural differences across different technologies that lead to inherently different ability to attain quality levels, innovation levels, and cost structures. |
| Approximation Error | Value Capture | Organization | A startup's initial choice of capabilities it will nurture and resources that it will draw upon, determined by the entrepreneur's initial team and culture. Organizational uncertainty arises because of how agile or sluggish a firm may be in allocating resources to quality vs. innovation. |
| | | Competition | Firms that provide similar products or services (or otherwise solve the same or similar customer needs) to a startup's chosen customer. Uncertainty arises from unpredictable competitive actions and reactions. |
| | | Regulatory | Uncertainty arising from potential regulatory actions, including scope and timing of regulations, as well as the impact of antitrust regulations on industry structure. |
| | | Industry | Uncertainty arising from the actions of firms, regulators, and the nature of technology. Factors such as technological architecture's influence on firm's ability to integrate or modularize, or antitrust regulation's influence on firm's accumulation of market power introduces variation in the industry structure. |
| Optimization Error | Value Delivery | Market | Uncertainty arising from the actions of firms and consumers. On the supply side, firm's decisions affect switching costs, network effects, and integration/modularization. On the demand side, consumers' preferences for quality, innovation, price, and compatibility introduce uncertainty. |
| | | Product | The set of potential product or service designs, features, and attributes. Uncertainty arises from the unpredictable success of different product designs and features in meeting customer needs and preferences. |
