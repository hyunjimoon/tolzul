- process/vertical integration
- bridge compassed brain, mapped world
- evaluated by [[123🗺️->14🧭_scott]]
- bayesian part with finite memory, evolutionary counterpart is developed in [[charlie🗺️(🧭, 🌏)]], which are then integrated in [[13🧍‍♀️->24🌏_jb]]
- human's mind becomes measurable because it is monetized. only when it is measured can we rational meaning can be constructed. 

- Represents the operational-financial coupling in startup development - Product 1 examines how business choices (operations, market) are optimized given capital constraints, while Product 2 explores how capital structure (investment terms, resources) is optimized given business strategy. These interlock because optimal business choices depend on available capital, while optimal capital structure depends on business potential. Running these analyses in parallel allows better understanding of their mutual constraints and opportunities, like how operational capabilities might limit fundraising options, or how financing terms might constrain operational choices.

 [[📝Recovering Cost and Revenue Reasoning Rationality with Environments]] and [[📝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] are two sides of one coin. The former fixes resource then optimizes business choices (supply chain and market), while the latter fixes business choices then optimize resource. In reality, optimization happens in the joint space of resource, supply chain, market, with the `capitalize`, `collaborate`, `segment`  process. We attribute the difficulty to play 3D game as our finite memory i.e. cognitive constraint.
