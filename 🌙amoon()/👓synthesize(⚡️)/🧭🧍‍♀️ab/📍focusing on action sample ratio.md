1. [[📜Agrawal21_ebl_choice]] is isomorphic to [[🗄️👁️🧠explain_away]]
2. from simulation model, optimal test N choose 1 (TNC1)'s N (y axis of "optimal sample per decision") is proportional to action and sample time-cost ratio (`A2S`)
3. temporally, `A2S` is likely to increase from nail to sail (increase of action time-cost `A2S`); spatially `A2S` is larger for control (than execute) and collaborate (than compete)
4. based on 2, TNC1's N should be larger for control and collaborate
5. based on 1, different observed behavior of TNC1's N (parallel vs sequential) can all be interpreted as rational (environment's `A2S` explains away irrationality given heterogeneous observed behavior)

using [Explaining Away and Mach Illusion: How Lighting, Reflectance, and Shape Affect Shading and Contours cld](https://claude.ai/chat/b10d0a7d-0af1-4b12-b081-b091b5e7c7c8) 

🔑 Takeaways:
1. Information Flow: Explaining away is about posterior correlations - when observing evidence about one cause affects our beliefs about other causes, even though they're a priori independent
2. Manipulation Effects: 
   - Covering top/bottom parts reveals identical middle sections
   - One-eye viewing changes depth perception
   - Lighting direction affects perceived reflectance
   - Squinting/blurring strengthens certain interpretations
3. Brain Processing: Shape and color/brightness processing, once thought separate, are actually interconnected

This expanded framework shows how A2S ratios, shaped by Rosenbergian uncertainty, explain apparently irrational variations in entrepreneurial testing and strategy choices.

**Integration Explanation:**
Just as the Mach illusion demonstrates how environmental lighting (🌏) and shape cues (🟩) explain away seemingly irrational surface perceptions (🔴), the Rosenbergian uncertainty framework shows how economic context and A2S ratios explain apparently irrational testing behaviors. When we observe different TNC1 patterns (🔷), what appears as inefficient sampling behavior is actually explained by underlying A2S constraints (🟩) shaped by the economic uncertainty environment (🌏). This explains why seemingly "irrational" variations in testing approaches may be optimal responses to different A2S contexts, particularly in the control vs execution strategic choice.

The Control vs Execution paper validates this framework by showing how uncertain post-invention economics leads entrepreneurs to make divergent but rational choices between control-oriented (high A2S) and execution-oriented (low A2S) strategies, despite facing similar technological uncertainties.
## A2S examples

using [Analyzing Action-to-Sample Time-Cost Ratios cld](https://claude.ai/chat/6e2e7e0e-a37c-4988-80ce-3174365fcde6)

| Context                            | High/Low A2S                           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Driving Factor                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wealth vs. Poverty                 | Low A2S for wealthy, High A2S for poor | Wealthy individuals have lower sampling costs (easier access to information, financial education) and can afford to take slower actions. Poor individuals face higher sampling costs and need to act quickly due to resource constraints. | Sample cost variation: Higher education/access reduces sampling cost for wealthy |
| Private vs. Public Equity          | High A2S for PE/VC                     | PE/VC deals have much higher action costs due to due diligence, complex deal structures, and irreversibility of investment decisions. While sampling costs are also high (deep company analysis), the action cost increase dominates.     | Action cost increase: Complex, irreversible investment decisions                 |
| High vs. Low Frequency Trading     | Low A2S for HFT                        | HFT firms have automated systems reducing action costs dramatically. While they also have efficient sampling (real-time data), the action cost reduction is more significant.                                                             | Action cost decrease: Automated trading infrastructure                           |
| Desert vs. City Information Access | High A2S for desert                    | Someone in a desert has much higher sampling costs (limited access to information) compared to someone in a city with easy information access. Action costs remain similar.                                                               | Sample cost variation: Limited vs. abundant information access                   |
| Voting with/without Misinformation | High A2S with misinformation           | In environments with high misinformation, sampling costs increase significantly as verifying information becomes more difficult. Action cost (voting) remains constant.                                                                   | Sample cost increase: Difficulty in verifying information                        |
 
 
 👀 [Daron's ai strategy for  wait and see](https://time.com/charter/7023116/the-case-for-a-wait-and-see-approach-to-ai/)
 
 He argues that many companies are currently making AI investments simply to appease stakeholders and keep up with competitors, which often leads to hasty, poorly planned implementations without proper organizational readiness or employee training. While some companies (like social media firms) are already benefiting from AI, Acemoglu believes that for most businesses, the better strategy is to track and understand AI developments while planning for future investments, rather than making immediate large-scale commitments that may not deliver clear benefits.
