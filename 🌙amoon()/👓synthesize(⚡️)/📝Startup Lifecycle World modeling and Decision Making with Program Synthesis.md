- #todo explain why hidden technical loop cannot be modeled with bayesnet and parametric model

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for modeling entrepreneurial decision-making synthesizing three techniques. To address the limitations of traditional approaches such as using bayes network to represent parametric model, we propose: (1) adopting probabilistic programming over Bayesian networks for more flexible and expressive representation, (2) shifting to non-parametric models to better capture the diverse nature of entrepreneurial environments. This framework offers a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition, with significant implications for both theory and practice in entrepreneurship.
