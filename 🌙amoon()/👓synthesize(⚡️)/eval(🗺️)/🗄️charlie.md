| Forces pushing towards disintegration (vertical to horizontal) | Forces pushing towards integration (horizontal to vertical) |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. The relentless entry of niche competitors hoping to pick off discrete industry segments. | 1. Technical advances in one subsystem can make that the scarce commodity in the chain, giving market power to its owner. |
| 2. The challenge of keeping ahead of the competition across the many dimensions of technology and markets required by an integral system. | 2. Market power in one subsystem encourages bundling with other subsystems to increase control and add more value. |
| 3. The bureaucratic and organizational rigidities that often settle upon large, established companies. | 3. Market power in one subsystem encourages engineering integration with other subsystems to develop proprietary integral solutions. |
