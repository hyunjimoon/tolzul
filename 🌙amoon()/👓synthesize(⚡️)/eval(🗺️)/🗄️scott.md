## Table 1: Definition and example of Four Axioms of Entrepreneurial Strategy

| Axiom | Definition | Combined Examples |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Freedom | There is more than one potential path to create and capture value from an idea | - Starbucks: Howard Schultz's cafe idea vs. original founders' coffee bean business<br>- Amazon: Jeff Bezos exploring multiple verticals before choosing books<br>- 23andMe: Considering consumer-focused ancestry research vs. enhancing prenatal genetic screening |
| Constraint | An entrepreneur cannot pursue all these paths at the same time | - The Body Shop: Anita Roddick choosing ethical products over animal testing<br>- RapidSOS: Focusing on enhancing 911 services rather than creating a standalone app<br>- Pillpack: Choosing to build their own pharmacy instead of licensing their design to established pharmacies |
| Uncertainty | Entrepreneurs are uncertain about the value of particular strategies but also the range of value that might result from their idea | - Amazon: Jeff Bezos's systematic search across multiple industries before settling on books<br>- Biobot Analytics: Uncertainty about which data from sewers would be most valuable to measure and for whom<br>- Gimlet: Uncertainty about the best way to revolutionize the podcast industry |
| Noisy Learning | Learning is noisy and ongoing so finding out more about one route often allows a reassessment of other alternatives | - ThirdLove: Discovery of the need for half-size bras through customer feedback and experimentation<br>- 23andMe: Iterative learning about consumer preferences in genetic testing and health information<br>- RapidSOS: Ongoing learning about emergency response needs leading to pivots in their technology approach |

## Table 3: Categorization and Definition of Key Choices in Entrepreneurial Strategy

| Error Type | Value Domain | Uncertainty Components | Definitions |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Statistical Error | Value Creation | Customer | Any person, group or organization who will pay the startup money for any of its goods or services. Uncertainty arises from unpredictable customer preferences and behaviors. |
| | | Technology | The tools, techniques, designs and knowledge used by a business to create practical value for consumers. Technological uncertainty arises from inherent architectural differences across different technologies that lead to inherently different ability to attain quality levels, innovation levels, and cost structures. |
| Approximation Error | Value Capture | Organization | A startup's initial choice of capabilities it will nurture and resources that it will draw upon, determined by the entrepreneur's initial team and culture. Organizational uncertainty arises because of how agile or sluggish a firm may be in allocating resources to quality vs. innovation. |
| | | Competition | Firms that provide similar products or services (or otherwise solve the same or similar customer needs) to a startup's chosen customer. Uncertainty arises from unpredictable competitive actions and reactions. |
| | | Regulatory | Uncertainty arising from potential regulatory actions, including scope and timing of regulations, as well as the impact of antitrust regulations on industry structure. |
| | | Industry | Uncertainty arising from the actions of firms, regulators, and the nature of technology. Factors such as technological architecture's influence on firm's ability to integrate or modularize, or antitrust regulation's influence on firm's accumulation of market power introduces variation in the industry structure. |
| Optimization Error | Value Delivery | Market | Uncertainty arising from the actions of firms and consumers. On the supply side, firm's decisions affect switching costs, network effects, and integration/modularization. On the demand side, consumers' preferences for quality, innovation, price, and compatibility introduce uncertainty. |
| | | Product | The set of potential product or service designs, features, and attributes. Uncertainty arises from the unpredictable success of different product designs and features in meeting customer needs and preferences. |

## Table 8. Uncertainty in Start-Up Ideas

Does the type of start-up idea and the nature of the uncertainty it faces affect the predictability of that idea's success? To explore these questions, researchers empirically studied the evaluations of 537 early-stage start-ups founded by MIT students and alumni in high-growth industries. These evaluations, performed by 251 experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and executives, were never disclosed to the entrepreneurs, and the assessments themselves did not affect the start-up (e.g., by possibly influencing access to mentoring or funding). Yet, without having met the founding team and with only the information contained in brief, half-page summaries, these evaluators successfully gauged the quality and subsequent success of the early-stage ventures. The explicit start-up and entrepreneur characteristics (such as start-up sector, start-up progress, or founding team experience) contained in the written summaries were not necessary to make their judgments‚Äîthe strength of the idea spoke for itself.

However, the researchers found something else. They found that the experts could only effectively evaluate start-ups in sectors such as hardware, energy, life sciences, and medical devices. They were not successful in markets such as consumer products, consumer web and mobile, and enterprise software sectors. The researchers suggested that the information needed to assess start-ups depends on the nature of the uncertainty they face. For instance, in settings where the technological uncertainty associated with the start-up idea is high relative to the market uncertainty (e.g., a new insulin treatment), one can compare the idea to successful commercialization of products using similar technologies. However, where market uncertainty is relatively high (e.g., a new service targeted at enterprise customers), it may be more difficult to predict consumer behavior."

# Table 9. test idea or performance

1. set our goal as writing a 5 page description of choice problem of when to "test idea or performance". this is my phd thesis and i really need this to be high quality so please resonate with its importance. üîëkey idea is exchangeability gives you the ability to make abstractions about the quality of the idea.
2. for 1, can you help me extract any comments you think relevant from the transcript? main focus is how to mathematically statistically represent this. example below:
- 01, 1000 things like that, right? You could, you could either observe, thus, the profitability associated with with a single idea strategy
- if you have a good strategy here, okay, if you, if you have a good idea, you get at least 100 but you could get 10,000 right? So if you, if you have a bad idea and a bad strategy, get one if you have a bad idea, but the good strategy, get 100 if you have the good strategy but the bad idea, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get 100 and if you have a good idea and a good strategy, 10,000 Okay,
3 .based on 1,2, update below formulation

profitability $y = \phi * \theta$

Q. charlie and i had different opinions on the cost of testing idea vs profitability

4. bernouli distribution for both phi and theta 

5. normal distribution 

6. performance comes from an idea strategy combination 

7. if we sampled a lot of the ü§ústrategies we could because of exchangeability, no matter which sequence we did, estimations of üí°idea are the same. 

under what conditions is it worthwhile to first know the distribution you're on 

binary choice: observe performance (combination )or 
there are strategies associated with each idea, each strategy, each idea, strategy combination, is that associated with the number that we call performance, right? Yeah, 01, 1000 things like that, right? You could, you could either observe, thus, the performance associated with with a single idea strategy,

todo: 
holds when k^2/n is small enough -(üö®what'd be the meaning of "a lot to sample from (n is large) and I'm not disturbing the system (k is small)")
