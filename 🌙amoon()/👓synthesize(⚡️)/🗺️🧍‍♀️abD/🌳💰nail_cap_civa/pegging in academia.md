In academia, published papers are considered to be a currency, and it seems generative AI is accelerating inflation by making paper production faster and easier. As a first year phd, I'm struggling from this widening gap of quantity and quality, both as a consumer and producer of knowledge.

I think
1. we should marketize academia (set evaluation measures i.e. monetize utility function)
2. segment academia market into submarkets to elicit more specified solution and need which can help need-solution pairing 
3. define local currency within homogenous market (so that currency in certain market is pegged to stable value that members in the submarket can agree upon.  

just as valuation of shell 🐚is stable in country A but ⚜️is more stable in country B, evaluation measures we should adopt should differ (mostly around atom-ness based on my experience)

example of [field -> evaluation that I think would be stable] mapping

e.g.1 capital intensive science fields (semiconductor, quantum computing, clinical trial) -> collaboration network 
e.g.2 data science field-> number of github package download, prediction accuracy or score in competition

Q1. Drawing parallels to economic models, how might 'pegging' in academia be implemented? 
- "pegging" in economics is fixing the value of one currency to the value of another currency, a commodity, or a basket of currencies. It's used to stabilize a currency by attaching it to the value of something more stable.  
- pegging paper  to knowledge (or its use) ensures that research not only proliferates rapidly but also retains high quality (defined as fitness of use as a function of usability, usefulness, and desirability). 
- market segmentation in academia may facilitate pegging as it is easier to elicit usability, usefulness, desirability from segment with homogenous goals.

| **Academic Institutions** | **Government Economic Functions** | **Purpose** | **A is Pegged to B** (uncertainty A>B) |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Peer Review Processes | Central Bank Interest Rate Policy | To control the quality and integrity of academic outputs. | Peer review is pegged to the potential for knowledge advancement and practical applications (higher uncertainty in peer review compared to knowledge advancement potential). |
| Publication Standards | Currency Stabilization | To ensure academic output holds long-term value and usability. | Publication standards are pegged to the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings (higher uncertainty in publication standards compared to reproducibility and replicability). |
| Impact Factor Measurement | Inflation Tracking | To measure the growth and impact of academic outputs in real-time. | Impact factor measurement is pegged to the real-world adoption and citation of academic works (higher uncertainty in impact factor measurement compared to real-world adoption). |
| Funding Allocation | Fiscal Policy | To allocate resources based on the potential impact of academic work. | Funding allocation is pegged to the alignment with societal needs and potential for breakthrough discoveries (higher uncertainty in funding allocation compared to societal needs alignment). |
| Accreditation Bodies | Regulatory Agencies | To oversee and maintain standards across academic institutions. | Accreditation is pegged to the quality of education, research outputs, and institutional practices (higher uncertainty in accreditation compared to education and research quality). |

Q2. If you were me, to implement and persuade this, would you write "yet another paper"?

To solidify analogy, below compares of functions of academia institution and government. gpt gave answers

Below is from Matt's talk on academia as enterprise where the bottom process alludes market segmentation.
