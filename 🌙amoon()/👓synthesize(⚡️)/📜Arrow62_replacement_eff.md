| Component | Incumbent (Monopolist) | Entrant (Competitor) | Key Mechanism |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Initial Position** | High pre-invention profits<br>(Strong "financial interest in status quo") | Zero pre-invention profits<br>(Nothing to replace) | Monopolist's profits act as disincentive |
| **Sampling Strategy** | • High-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ control<br>• "High-bar" experiments<br>• Minimize false positives | • Low-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ execution<br>• "Low-bar" experiments<br>• Minimize false negatives | Different risk tolerances due to pre-invention position |
| **Time Horizon** | • Later optimal point (t ≈ 4.9)<br>• Gradual $\color{Green}{cost}$ slope<br>• Can afford to wait | • Early optimal point (t ≈ 1.1)<br>• Steep $\color{Green}{cost}$ slope<br>• Must move quickly | Delay costs affect optimal timing |
| **Innovation Incentive** | $V_{monopolist} = P'- P$<br>(New profits minus old profits) | $V_{entrant} = P'$<br>(Just new profits) | Replacement effect reduces incumbent incentive by $P$ |
| **Example** | Military aircraft pre-1940s:<br>• Long development cycles<br>• High precision required<br>• Protected market position | Software startups:<br>• Rapid iteration<br>• MVP approach<br>• Racing to market | Same $P'$ but different net incentives |

Key Insights:
1. Value differences: Entrant's gain ($P'$) > Monopolist's gain ($P'- P$)
2. Time pressure: Entrant faces higher $\color{Green}{cost}$ of delay
3. Risk strategy: Different $\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ choices optimal for each
4. Market structure: Pre-invention profits become innovation barrier
