| Cap Table: Resolving Ellen Monk's promised shares | - The situation: <br>Ellen's contribution was minimal and she left the company. Ellen's 400,000 shares were never issued and she is no longer involved with the company. <br><br>- How we plan to act on it: <br>We won't issue her shares. Issuing her shares now would be unfair to the current team and investors. | - Why it's safe to act on it in that way (recall the lawyer advice)                                                                                                                                                                                                 | VCs will want a clean cap table without any uncertainties or potential legal issues.                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                          |                                           |

A recognition of what we have already contributed to the company. For people that will be hired for the company, they start from zero, hence it's fine that they will have vesting only. With founders that's a different case. |                                                                                                                                                                                                    | What if you are terminated from the company and put other people in the company.

The founder will not be able to gain more control if a founder or employee is exiting before you. | Right of first refusal could limit founder liquidity and ability to bring in other investors/partners in the future.                     | Founders and VC                           |

The Right of First Refusal row was added based on the information provided. The founders want to avoid giving the VC this right as it could limit their control and upside, while the VC wants this right to maintain control and prevent dilution. This is an important point for both the founders and VC to consider and negotiate.
