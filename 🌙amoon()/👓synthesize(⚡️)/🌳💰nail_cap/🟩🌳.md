Table2. function-wise decomposition of rational agency for SAFE optimization

These queries allow entrepreneurs to decompose complex problems into manageable components, effectively relaxing resource constraints. To concretize these concepts, we provide a summary that maps key elements such as utility functions, state variables, actions, and other components to their specific roles in our framework for equity value inference and term sheet optimization, as shown in Table 4.
