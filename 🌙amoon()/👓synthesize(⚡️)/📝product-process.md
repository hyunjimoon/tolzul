## 📦Modules
This integrated framework maps entrepreneurial decision-making across Agent scope (Discrete vs Continuous) and Integration type (Process/Yang vs Product/Ying), while connecting theoretical frameworks to their concrete research implementations. The Process Integration row demonstrates dynamic optimization approaches: Resource Rationality (AB) uses Bayesian inference to optimize discrete cognitive resource allocation between cost-reduction and revenue-growth (formalized in [[eval(charlie, 📝Vectorizing Venture Adaptation)]], while Evolutionary Adaptation (abE) manages continuous experimentation through parallel/sequential testing strategies (detailed in [[📝🪶Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]]). The Product Integration row focuses on structural representations: Valuation Agreement (ABD) constructs meaning in discrete investment spaces through hierarchical Bayesian lay theory (developed in [[👻phantom rationalize meaning]] and [[📝🤝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]]), while Lifecycle Modeling (ABED) builds integrated world representations through non-parametric inference and program synthesis (presented in [[📝🌳🌊Startup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]]). Each cell provides a complete path from theoretical foundation through algorithmic approach and technical implementation, culminating in specific research products that demonstrate the framework's practical applications.

## 📝Product
#### 1. [[eval(charlie, 📝Vectorizing Venture Adaptation)]]
- Evaluators: Charlie, Scott, Josh (class project)
- Duration: 23W-24W
	- Abstract:This paper develops a computational framework for understanding entrepreneurial cognitive resource allocation during venture scaling. Through vector-based modeling of cost-reducing and revenue-growing activities, we demonstrate how seemingly biased allocation patterns emerge as rational adaptations to industry-specific returns and uncertainties. Our framework unifies entrepreneurial decision-making through two key dimensions: directional focus between market and operations, and execution speed in sampling and action.
	
	- ✅ Agree with:
		- Sequential decision-making where each step requires choosing between operations OR market understanding, with Operational capability capping monetization of market knowledge
		- Both "thinker" and "doer" strategies as rational responses to specific industry-entrepreneur contexts
	- ❌ Disagree with:  
		- Traditional decision-making models that don't account for resource constraints in scaling companies  
		- The role of Bayesian inference methods for researchers from Bayesian decision-making by agents should be distinguished

#### 2. [[📝🪶Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]]
- Collaborators/Evaluators: Charlie, JB
- Duration: 24S-25, JB submitted abstract to [complex adaptive systems](https://sites.mit.edu/cas2025/) as solo author for now (couldn't get charlie's reply)
- Abstract: Ventures face a critical choice between sequential and parallel search strategies when testing new opportunities. We synthesize three theoretical perspectives - experimental design theory, adjacent possibility theory, and convergence diagnostics - to understand this choice. Our synthesis reveals that parallel search represents a "low-bar" experiment design emphasizing exaptation through many short chains, while sequential search embodies a "high-bar" approach favoring adaptation through fewer, longer chains. Through computational modeling of Bayesian belief updating, we formalize when each strategy is optimal by analyzing three key dimensions: a) 📍Cost structure, where parallel search becomes optimal when test-to-action cost ratios are low (T4C1 total cost = 4test + $\color{Red}{1choose}$ vs T2C1 total cost = (2test + $\color{Red}{1choose}$) × 2); b) 🎲Uncertainty propagation, where parallel search enables broader exploration of the 'adjacent possible' through simultaneous testing ($\color{Green}{\sigma_c}, \color{Purple}{\sigma_r} \sim \color{SkyBlue}{exp(\sigma)}$), allowing ventures to discover unexpected possibilities (exaptation) rather than committing early to a single path; c) 🧩Correlation effects, both horizontal (across industry) and vertical (within value chain), where parallel search better captures joint distributions and cross-level dependencies ($\color{Green}{\sigma_c}, \color{Purple}{\sigma_r} \sim \color{Orange}{\rho} * \color{SkyBlue}{exp(\sigma)}$). We derive a unified decision rule: choose parallel search when implementation costs and uncertainty are high ($\color{Red}{c_{act}} * \color{SkyBlue}{\sigma} * \color{Orange}{k}$ is large), prefer need (market)-first sequential search when market uncertainty dominates ($\color{Green}{\sigma_c} < \color{Purple}{\sigma_r}$), and default to solution (product)-first sequential search otherwise. This framework reconciles the apparent inefficiency of parallel search with its empirical prevalence by showing how high uncertainty and correlation can make broad exploration through parallel, low-bar experiments more valuable than deep exploitation through sequential, high-bar tests. 
- ✅ Agree with: The exploration of both parallel and sequential approaches to startup adaptation, using probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling to manage experimentation and reduce cognitive biases in pivoting decisions.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that a one-size-fits-all approach to startup adaptation is sufficient, without considering the varying contexts of technological innovation, customer segments, and the relative costs of testing versus pivoting.

#### 3a. [[👻phantom rationalize meaning]]
- Collaborators: Jeff
- Evaluators: Teppo Felin, Todd Zenger, Arnaldo Camuffo at ION lab conference where phds have thesis presentation opportunities (Jan.2025)
- Duration: 24S-24W
- Abstract: Early-stage venture investors make decisions with limited information, relying on observable startup characteristics to form expectations about potential success. For example, prior research shows that investors often focus on factors like the management team or business model when assessing a firm’s ability to execute its vision. Little is known, however, about how these observable characteristics map onto the perceptions investors use when evaluating deals or how this mapping varies by investor type. Our research investigates this process, drawing on theories of rational meaning creation and lay theory construction to explain how investors interpret observable signals as indicators of unobservable qualities. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that allows us to empirically study how investors with different expertise and focus areas translate deal characteristics into structured beliefs about a venture’s potential.
   Our framework models two key perceptual dimensions that emerge from investors' lay theories: beliefs about the business model validity and the team’s ability to execution (i.e., is the idea viable and can the team make it happen). Using a novel experimental design that combines survey research methods with large language models, we elicit these belief structures from archetypical investors (e.g., early-stage software VCs, growth-stage investors). The hierarchical structure allows us to identify both individual-level heterogeneity in how investors evaluate startups and population-level patterns in attribute-to-perception mappings, while the LLM augmentation enables systematic exploration of investor responses across a broad range of startup profiles.
  Our approach reveals how the process of heterogeneous rational meaning construction can lead to systematically different valuations of identical startups. We find that investors' domain expertise and investment stage create distinct lay theories about which observable characteristics signal strong execution capability or business model validity. Taken collectively,  our research can help explain several puzzling phenomena in entrepreneurial finance, including persistent valuation disparities and apparent term sheet inefficiencies (todo). Our findings advance a theoretical understanding of meaning construction in high-stakes financial decisions while providing practical guidance for both entrepreneurs and investors in early-stage negotiations.
#### 3b.[[📝🤝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]]
- Evaluators: Vikash (class project)
- Duration: 24W-25S
- Abstract: We introduce a prototype toolbox for startup pivoting, employing a cognitive system’s multi-level framework to reconcile tension between action and optimization in entrepreneurship. By modeling founders and investors as resource-rational agents, we interpret inference-based proposals as actions, viewing term sheet negotiations as a convergence process toward optimal solutions. In this context, conversational inference between parties represents an information processing mechanism aimed at maximizing expected utility given shared beliefs. Our approach synthesizes entrepreneurial strategy, Bayesian decision theory, probabilistic programming, and conversational inference across computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels. This toolbox bridges the gap between theoretical optimization objectives with algorithmic actions in entrepreneurial practice.
- ✅ Agree with: The strategic value of parallel search in fundraising, where founders engage multiple investors simultaneously to create alternatives, gain market insights, and optimize term sheet outcomes.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that founders should quickly accept the first term sheet or limit their interactions to a single investor, rather than deliberately slowing down the process to create multiple options and gain negotiating leverage.

#### 4. [[📝🌳🌊Startup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]]
- Evaluators: 
- Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for modeling entrepreneurial decision-making synthesizing three techniques. To address the limitations of traditional approaches such as using Bayesian network to represent parametric models, we propose: (1) adopting probabilistic programming over Bayesian networks for more flexible and expressive representation, and (2) shifting to non-parametric models to better capture the diverse nature of entrepreneurial environments. This framework offers a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition, with significant implications for both theory and practice in entrepreneurship.
- ✅ Agree with: The adoption of probabilistic programming and non-parametric models to better capture the diverse and complex nature of entrepreneurial environments, offering a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition.
- ❌ Disagree with: The reliance on traditional Bayesian networks and parametric models for representing entrepreneurial decision-making, which may not adequately capture the flexibility and adaptability required in startup environments.

#### 1 $\overset{🧠}{\leftarrow}{\underset{🤜👓}{\rightarrow}}$ 3
- [[eval(charlie, 📝Vectorizing Venture Adaptation)]] and [[📝🤝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] are two sides of one coin. The former fixes resource then optimizes business choices (supply chain and market), while the latter fixes business choices then optimize resource. In reality, optimization happens in the joint space of resource, supply chain, market, with the `capitalize`, `collaborate`, `segment`  process. We attribute the difficulty to play 3D game as our finite memory i.e. cognitive constraint.
