Outlet: candidate journal that appreciates modeling + where I have access to evaluators for research-journal fit are logged in [segment: journal characteristics](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/255). Segmenting too early is costly so I didn’t add outlet for individual articles yet. Collaborators are also tentative as I didn’t get any commitment from my investors (except JB).

## Architecture
### four modules
The first table presents a framework mapping out four product approaches across two fundamental dimensions: Agent scope (Discrete vs Continuous) and Integration type (Process vs Product). The Process Integration row (Yang) focuses on dynamic flows - showing how Resource Rationality handles discrete resource allocation processes, while Evolutionary Search manages continuous adaptation processes. Meanwhile, the Product Integration row (Ying) focuses on structural coherence - showing how Equity Proposals builds modular fairness structures in discrete spaces, while World Modeling creates integrated representations of continuous realities. This 2x2 matrix elegantly captures how different products balance the dynamic "flow" of processes with the static "structure" of products, while also considering whether they operate in discrete agent-focused spaces or continuous environment-inclusive spaces.

### modules to papers
Table2 provides in-depth summaries of the same four approaches, but organized to highlight their theoretical and implementation details. In the Process Integration domain (Yang/dynamic), Resource Rationality demonstrates dynamic flow through its real-time Bayesian inference for cognitive resource allocation, while Evolutionary Search shows continuous adaptation through parallel/sequential experimentation strategies. In the Product Integration domain (Ying/static), Equity Proposals builds structural understanding through proposal-based negotiation frameworks, while World Modeling creates integrated representations through program synthesis and scenario planning. The key difference from the previous table is that this format delves deeper into each approach's theoretical foundations and practical implementations, while maintaining the same fundamental organization across agent scope (Discrete vs Continuous) and integration type (Process vs Product). Each summary reveals how these approaches either manage dynamic flows (Process) or build coherent structures (Product) in their respective domains.

| **Agent/Process Integration**🧍‍♀️🧭    | [[📝Recovering Cost and Revenue Reasoning Rationality with Environments]] This paper introduces a computational framework for entrepreneurial resource allocation through the lens of resource rationality. At its core is the Resource Rationality Ratio (RRR), which formalizes how entrepreneurs distribute limited cognitive bandwidth between revenue reasoning (market understanding) and cost reasoning (operational capabilities). The framework employs Bayesian inference engines with online learning to model how entrepreneurs make sequential investment decisions between reducing operational costs (precision M) and growing revenue opportunities (precision N). Through industry-specific parameterization, it demonstrates how seemingly "biased" allocation patterns can emerge as rational adaptations to different expected returns and uncertainties. The implementation provides real-time decision support through Stan/Gen inference engines, enabling entrepreneurs to optimize their cognitive resource investments across market and operational domains. |
| **Agent+Env/Process Integration**🌏🧭   | [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] This study examines how startups can systematically structure their search for opportunities through parallel and sequential experimentation strategies. Focusing on the balance between exploration and exploitation, it introduces a "test-two-choose-one" approach that systematically evaluates different adaptation patterns. The framework employs evolutionary computation platforms to simulate and optimize search strategies across varying contexts of technological innovation and customer segments. Key findings reveal when parallel search outperforms sequential approaches, particularly in conditions of high uncertainty and low correlation between innovation values. The implementation provides an adaptive experimentation platform that helps startups optimize their pivot decisions while minimizing cognitive biases in the exploration process.                                                                                                                                   |

It models founders and investors as resource-rational agents engaging in proposal-based negotiations aimed at maximizing shared utility. The framework employs sequential optimization based on post-money SAFE models to structure negotiations, while using probabilistic programming for term meaning extraction. By viewing term sheet negotiations as a convergence process, it implements a natural language interface built on the MIT inference stack that helps parties arrive at optimal solutions through structured information exchange and belief updating. The system bridges theoretical optimization objectives with practical negotiation dynamics in entrepreneurial fundraising.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Product
#### 1. [[📝Recovering Cost and Revenue Reasoning Rationality with Environments]]
- evaluators: Charlie, Scott
- Duration: 23W-24W
	- Abstract:This paper develops a computational framework for understanding how entrepreneurs allocate cognitive resources during venture scaling through the lens of resource rationality. We introduce a Resource Rationality Ratio (RRR) that formalizes how entrepreneurs invest their limited cognitive bandwidth between revenue reasoning (e.g., market segmentation) and cost reasoning (e.g., operational collaboration). Through formal modeling of industry-specific parameters, we demonstrate how seemingly "biased" allocation patterns can be explained as rational adaptations to different expected returns and uncertainties in market versus operational investments. Building on this understanding of basic resource rationality mechanics, we operationalize entrepreneurial meta-reasoning as sequential cognitive resource investment decisions, where entrepreneurs must choose between reducing cost-reducing action (precision M), revenue-growing action (precision N). This framework enables identification of three practical approaches for improving entrepreneurial decision-making: reducing degrees of freedom through anchoring, extending cognitive runtime through resource management, and decreasing noise through structured knowledge transfer. Our findings have implications for founder decision-making, venture capital strategy, and entrepreneurship education.
	
	- ✅ Agree with:
		- Sequential decision-making where each step requires choosing between operations OR market understanding, with Operational capability capping monetization of market knowledge
		- Both "thinker" and "doer" strategies as rational responses to specific industry-entrepreneur contexts
	- ❌ Disagree with:  
		- Traditional decision-making models that don't account for resource constraints in scaling companies  
		- The role of Bayesian inference methods for researchers from Bayesian decision-making by agents should be distinguished


#### 2. [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]]
- Collaborators: JB
- Duration: 24S-25, JB submitted abstract to [complex adaptive systems](https://sites.mit.edu/cas2025/) as solo author for now (couldn't get charlie's reply)
- Abstract: Entrepreneurs in dynamic markets face the challenge of balancing exploration and commitment, particularly when deciding when to pivot based on new information. Pivots are essential for adapting to market changes, but excessive or poorly timed pivots can hinder learning and harm long-term performance. The concept of exaptation (the repurposing of existing resources for new uses), offers two key strategies for structured experimentation: parallel pivots, which involve broad exploration of simultaneously tested ideas, and sequential pivots, a methodical approach where each experiment informs the next. However, there is uncertainty inherent in these strategic decisions. In this study, we explore how they can be mitigated by using probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling, which offer a structured framework for managing experimentation. We compare "test-four-choose-one" parallel and "test-two-choose-one-twice" sequential approaches across varying contexts of technological innovation and customer segments. Our initial results reveal parallel search outperforms sequential search when: test costs are low relative to pivoting costs, uncertainty is high, and true values of innovations and customer segments have low correlation. We discuss how these approaches allow startups to continuously update their beliefs and adjust probabilities based on new evidence, enabling data-driven decisions about when to pivot. They might reduce the influence of cognitive biases, such as overconfidence and sunk cost fallacy. By applying these probabilistic tools to both parallel and sequential search strategies, entrepreneurs might optimize innovation, minimize over-pivoting, and increase their chances of long-term success. This study contributes to the understanding of how entrepreneurs can systematically manage uncertainty, optimize resource use.
- ✅ Agree with: The exploration of both parallel and sequential approaches to startup adaptation, using probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling to manage experimentation and reduce cognitive biases in pivoting decisions.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that a one-size-fits-all approach to startup adaptation is sufficient, without considering the varying contexts of technological innovation, customer segments, and the relative costs of testing versus pivoting.

#### 3. [[📝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]]
- Evaluators: Josh, Vikash (class project), Jeff
- Duration: 24S-25S
- Abstract: We introduce a prototype toolbox for startup pivoting, employing a cognitive system’s multi-level framework to reconcile tension between action and optimization in entrepreneurship. By modeling founders and investors as resource-rational agents, we interpret inference-based proposals as actions, viewing term sheet negotiations as a convergence process toward optimal solutions. In this context, conversational inference between parties represents an information processing mechanism aimed at maximizing expected utility given shared beliefs. Our approach synthesizes entrepreneurial strategy, Bayesian decision theory, probabilistic programming, and conversational inference across computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels. This toolbox bridges the gap between theoretical optimization objectives with algorithmic actions in entrepreneurial practice.
- ✅ Agree with: The strategic value of parallel search in fundraising, where founders engage multiple investors simultaneously to create alternatives, gain market insights, and optimize term sheet outcomes.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that founders should quickly accept the first term sheet or limit their interactions to a single investor, rather than deliberately slowing down the process to create multiple options and gain negotiating leverage.

#### 4. [[📝Startup Lifecycle World modeling with Program Synthesis]]
- Evaluators: Teppo Felin, Todd Zenger, Arnaldo Camuffo at ION lab conference where phds have thesis presentation opportunities (Jan.2025)
- Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for modeling entrepreneurial decision-making synthesizing three techniques. To address the limitations of traditional approaches such as using Bayesian network to represent parametric models, we propose: (1) adopting probabilistic programming over Bayesian networks for more flexible and expressive representation, and (2) shifting to non-parametric models to better capture the diverse nature of entrepreneurial environments. This framework offers a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition, with significant implications for both theory and practice in entrepreneurship.
- ✅ Agree with: The adoption of probabilistic programming and non-parametric models to better capture the diverse and complex nature of entrepreneurial environments, offering a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition.
- ❌ Disagree with: The reliance on traditional Bayesian networks and parametric models for representing entrepreneurial decision-making, which may not adequately capture the flexibility and adaptability required in startup environments.

#### 5. [[📝Programmatic Theory in Entrepreneurship with Integrated Reasoning and Rational Meaning Construction]]
- Collaborators: Tom (Fiddaman), Matt, Abdullah, Charlie, Scott
- Duration: 23S -25W, planning a conference on  [Prescriptive Bayes 2025 or 26 StanConnect](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/144) topic which engineers the bridge btw inference and decision making as parallel flow of upstream testing and downstream prescription.
- Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent theory-practice gap in entrepreneurship by introducing a novel framework for developing and applying programmatic theory. We begin by critically examining Ed Roberts' heuristics for entrepreneurial scholars' topic selection, challenging the notion that scholars should only write about topics of immediate practitioner interest. Building on Cronin's (2024) recent model of knowledge production chains and Moon et al.'s (2024) integration of Bayesian inference and system dynamics, we propose a structured approach that balances the internal theoretical integration (from unit to programmatic) with external contextualization (expanding practical applications). Our framework consists of four key components: Validated Hypotheses (VH), Unit Theories (UT), Programmatic Theories (PT), and Practical Implications (PI). Through case studies in equity valuation and resource allocation during company scaling, we demonstrate how this framework constructs rational meaning and enhances theoretical coherence. By bridging the gaps between empirical validators (unit theory developers), integrators (programmatic developers), educators, and appliers (founders and investors), our work significantly increases the practical relevance of entrepreneurship theory while maintaining scholarly rigor. This approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape, but also provides actionable insights for entrepreneurs navigating complex decision-making processes in dynamic environments.
- ✅ Agree with: The development of a structured approach that integrates empirical findings, unit theories, and practical implications to bridge the gap between research and practice in entrepreneurship, enhancing theoretical coherence and practical relevance.
- ❌ Disagree with: The misconception that entrepreneurial scholars should only write about topics of immediate practitioner interest, rather than developing comprehensive programmatic theories that can inform long-term entrepreneurial practice and education.

- [[📝Recovering Cost and Revenue Reasoning Rationality with Environments]] and [[📝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] are two sides of one coin. The former fixes resource then optimizes business choices (supply chain and market), while the latter fixes business choices then optimize resource. In reality, optimization happens in the joint space of resource, supply chain, market, with the `capitalize`, `collaborate`, `segment`  process. We attribute the difficulty to play 3D game as our finite memory i.e. cognitive constraint.

#### (1423)-5
- [[📝Programmatic Theory in Entrepreneurship with Integrated Reasoning and Rational Meaning Construction]] focuses on validated hypothesis (VH), unit theory (UT), programmatic theory (PT), practical implication (PI) stocks in knowledge production chain sketched in [[Cronin24_kpc.png]]. Starting with three abductive findings (from entrepreneurial finance and/or operations), it shows how one is rejected and two are validated empirically. The remaining two forms unit theory which is further revised or integrated. Integrated unit theories become programmatic theory. During empirical analysis of 1) equity valuation and payoff in  [[📝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] and 2) cost reduction and revenue increase per unit investment, I should be mindful about how additional observation affects three stocks of knowledge: empirically validated findings, unit theory, programmatic theory. Also, while learning to use genParse/ChiExpert from [[📝Conversational Inference of Equity Valuation Agreement]] I should explain how rational meaning construction affects this knowledge production chain (unit: use). For World modeling in [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] gives idea on contextualization for dissemination through practical implications.
