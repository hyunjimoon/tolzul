## Product
#### 1. [[📝Resource rationality of Decision-Making and Inductive Bias during Scaling]]
- 
- Duration: 23W-24W
	- Abstract: We examine entrepreneurial decision-making during company scaling through the lens of resource rationality, introducing the Resource Rationality Ratio (RRR) framework. The RRR framework guides entrepreneurs in optimally allocating limited resources between two fundamental value drivers: (1) building operational capabilities that increase productivity and lower costs, and (2) developing deeper market understanding through segmentation to better approximate customer utility functions and capture higher revenues. Our research demonstrates how operational capabilities fundamentally constrain market value realization, with industry-specific and entrepreneur-specific factors determining optimal resource allocation strategies. Through analysis of the sequential trade-offs between investing in operations versus market understanding - where entrepreneurs, acting as Bayesian agents, must choose one at each decision point while updating their beliefs based on observed outcomes of previous actions - this framework helps explain why certain industry-entrepreneur combinations rationally lead to more analytical "thinkers" while others produce action-oriented "doers". The framework accounts for varying levels of uncertainty in operational versus market metrics, helping entrepreneurs determine when to shift resources between capability building and market expansion. While acknowledging limitations in dynamic environments with competition, our model provides practical guidance for resource-constrained entrepreneurs to make more effective scaling decisions, supported by empirical evidence from diverse industry contexts.
	
	- ✅ Agree with:
		- Sequential decision-making where each step requires choosing between operations OR market understanding, with Operational capability capping monetization of market knowledge
		- Both "thinker" and "doer" strategies as rational responses to specific industry-entrepreneur contexts
	- ❌ Disagree with:  
		- Traditional decision-making models that don't account for resource constraints in scaling companies  
		- The role of Bayesian inference methods for researchers from Bayesian decision-making by agents should be distinguished

#### 2. [[📝Equity Proposals as Actions Converging toward Optimal Term Sheet  during Scaling]]
- Evaluators: Josh, Vikash (class project), Jeff
- Duration: 24S-25S
- Abstract: We introduce a prototype toolbox for startup pivoting, employing a cognitive system’s multi-level framework to reconcile tension between action and optimization in entrepreneurship. By modeling founders and investors as resource-rational agents, we interpret inference-based proposals as actions, viewing term sheet negotiations as a convergence process toward optimal solutions. In this context, conversational inference between parties represents an information processing mechanism aimed at maximizing expected utility given shared beliefs. Our approach synthesizes entrepreneurial strategy, Bayesian decision theory, probabilistic programming, and conversational inference across computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels. This toolbox bridges the gap between theoretical optimization objectives with algorithmic actions in entrepreneurial practice.
- ✅ Agree with: The strategic value of parallel search in fundraising, where founders engage multiple investors simultaneously to create alternatives, gain market insights, and optimize term sheet outcomes.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that founders should quickly accept the first term sheet or limit their interactions to a single investor, rather than deliberately slowing down the process to create multiple options and gain negotiating leverage.

#### 3. [[📝Startup Lifecycle World modeling and Decision Making with Program Synthesis]]
- Evaluators: Teppo Felin, Todd Zenger, Arnaldo Camuffo at ION lab conference where phds have thesis presentation opportunities (Jan.2025)
- Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for modeling entrepreneurial decision-making synthesizing three techniques. To address the limitations of traditional approaches such as using Bayesian network to represent parametric models, we propose: (1) adopting probabilistic programming over Bayesian networks for more flexible and expressive representation, and (2) shifting to non-parametric models to better capture the diverse nature of entrepreneurial environments. This framework offers a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition, with significant implications for both theory and practice in entrepreneurship.
- ✅ Agree with: The adoption of probabilistic programming and non-parametric models to better capture the diverse and complex nature of entrepreneurial environments, offering a more sophisticated approach to understanding entrepreneurial cognition.
- ❌ Disagree with: The reliance on traditional Bayesian networks and parametric models for representing entrepreneurial decision-making, which may not adequately capture the flexibility and adaptability required in startup environments.

#### 4. [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]]
- Collaborators: JB
- Duration: 24S-25, JB submitted abstract to [complex adaptive systems](https://sites.mit.edu/cas2025/) as solo author for now (couldn't get charlie's reply)
- Abstract: Entrepreneurs in dynamic markets face the challenge of balancing exploration and commitment, particularly when deciding when to pivot based on new information. Pivots are essential for adapting to market changes, but excessive or poorly timed pivots can hinder learning and harm long-term performance. The concept of exaptation (the repurposing of existing resources for new uses), offers two key strategies for structured experimentation: parallel pivots, which involve broad exploration of simultaneously tested ideas, and sequential pivots, a methodical approach where each experiment informs the next. However, there is uncertainty inherent in these strategic decisions. In this study, we explore how they can be mitigated by using probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling, which offer a structured framework for managing experimentation. We compare "test-four-choose-one" parallel and "test-two-choose-one-twice" sequential approaches across varying contexts of technological innovation and customer segments. Our initial results reveal parallel search outperforms sequential search when: test costs are low relative to pivoting costs, uncertainty is high, and true values of innovations and customer segments have low correlation. We discuss how these approaches allow startups to continuously update their beliefs and adjust probabilities based on new evidence, enabling data-driven decisions about when to pivot. They might reduce the influence of cognitive biases, such as overconfidence and sunk cost fallacy. By applying these probabilistic tools to both parallel and sequential search strategies, entrepreneurs might optimize innovation, minimize over-pivoting, and increase their chances of long-term success. This study contributes to the understanding of how entrepreneurs can systematically manage uncertainty, optimize resource use.
- ✅ Agree with: The exploration of both parallel and sequential approaches to startup adaptation, using probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling to manage experimentation and reduce cognitive biases in pivoting decisions.
- ❌ Disagree with: The notion that a one-size-fits-all approach to startup adaptation is sufficient, without considering the varying contexts of technological innovation, customer segments, and the relative costs of testing versus pivoting.

#### 5. [[📝Programmatic Theory in Entrepreneurship with Integrated Reasoning and Rational Meaning Construction]]
- Collaborators: Tom (Fiddaman), Matt, Abdullah, Charlie, Scott
- Duration: 23S -25W, planning a conference on  [Prescriptive Bayes 2025 or 26 StanConnect](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/144) topic which engineers the bridge btw inference and decision making as parallel flow of upstream testing and downstream prescription.
- Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent theory-practice gap in entrepreneurship by introducing a novel framework for developing and applying programmatic theory. We begin by critically examining Ed Roberts' heuristics for entrepreneurial scholars' topic selection, challenging the notion that scholars should only write about topics of immediate practitioner interest. Building on Cronin's (2024) recent model of knowledge production chains and Moon et al.'s (2024) integration of Bayesian inference and system dynamics, we propose a structured approach that balances the internal theoretical integration (from unit to programmatic) with external contextualization (expanding practical applications). Our framework consists of four key components: Validated Hypotheses (VH), Unit Theories (UT), Programmatic Theories (PT), and Practical Implications (PI). Through case studies in equity valuation and resource allocation during company scaling, we demonstrate how this framework constructs rational meaning and enhances theoretical coherence. By bridging the gaps between empirical validators (unit theory developers), integrators (programmatic developers), educators, and appliers (founders and investors), our work significantly increases the practical relevance of entrepreneurship theory while maintaining scholarly rigor. This approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape, but also provides actionable insights for entrepreneurs navigating complex decision-making processes in dynamic environments.
- ✅ Agree with: The development of a structured approach that integrates empirical findings, unit theories, and practical implications to bridge the gap between research and practice in entrepreneurship, enhancing theoretical coherence and practical relevance.
- ❌ Disagree with: The misconception that entrepreneurial scholars should only write about topics of immediate practitioner interest, rather than developing comprehensive programmatic theories that can inform long-term entrepreneurial practice and education.

## Process

#### [[3🗺️->14🧭_scott]]
- [[📝Resource rationality of Decision-Making and Inductive Bias during Scaling]] and [[📝Equity Proposals as Actions Converging toward Optimal Term Sheet  during Scaling]] are two sides of one coin. The former fixes resource then optimizes business choices (supply chain and market), while the latter fixes business choices then optimize resource. In reality, optimization happens in the joint space of resource, supply chain, market, with the `capitalize`, `collaborate`, `segment`  process. We attribute the difficulty to play 3D game as our finite memory i.e. cognitive constraint.
#### [[charlie🗺️(🧭, 🌏)]]
- [[📝Startup Lifecycle World modeling and Decision Making with Program Synthesis]] relaxes cognitive constraint using program synthesis. This offers automated data modeling in a flexible manner, hence scalable.

- [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] explores bayesian and evolutionary learning. With stochastic world models evolving (hence non-stationary) across nail, scale, sail stage from [[📝Startup Lifecycle World modeling and Decision Making with Program Synthesis]], we revisit the known conclusion [behavior of bayesian inference with finite memory emerges from evolution under non-stationary stochastic environments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422100821X)

#### (1,2,3,4)-5
- [[📝Programmatic Theory in Entrepreneurship with Integrated Reasoning and Rational Meaning Construction]] focuses on validated hypothesis (VH), unit theory (UT), programmatic theory (PT), practical implication (PI) stocks in knowledge production chain sketched in [[Cronin24_kpc.png]]. Starting with three abductive findings (from entrepreneurial finance and/or operations), it shows how one is rejected and two are validated empirically. The remaining two forms unit theory which is further revised or integrated. Integrated unit theories become programmatic theory. During empirical analysis of 1) equity valuation and payoff in  [[📝Equity Proposals as Actions Converging toward Optimal Term Sheet  during Scaling]] and 2) cost reduction and revenue increase per unit investment, I should be mindful about how additional observation affects three stocks of knowledge: empirically validated findings, unit theory, programmatic theory. Also, while learning to use genParse/ChiExpert from [[📝Equity Proposals as Actions Converging toward Optimal Term Sheet  during Scaling]] I should explain how rational meaning construction affects this knowledge production chain (unit: use). For World modeling in [[📝Parallel Evolutionary and Sequential Bayesian Startup Adaptations]] gives idea on contextualization for dissemination through practical implications.
