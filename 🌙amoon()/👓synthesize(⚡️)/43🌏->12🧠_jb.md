## Integration Principles:

1. **Map/Meaning Integration**
   - Maps are visualizations of probabilistic world models
   - Meaning function projects reality onto formal models
   - Both create structured understanding of possibility space

2. **Compass/Inference Integration**
   - Compass represents sampling from posterior distributions
   - Inference engine computes optimal paths/actions
   - Both guide rational choices under uncertainty

3. **Computational Implementation**
   ```scheme
   ;; Meaning function projects observations to program state
   (define (meaning-function observation)
     (condition world-model observation))
   
   ;; Inference function computes optimal actions
   (define (inference-function world-state)
     (query optimal-action world-state))
   ```

## Key Theoretical Bridges:

1. **For Strategy Scholars:**
   - Maps = Formal world models expressed as programs
   - Compass = Inference algorithms over these models
   - Navigating with Map and Compass = Rational search through possibility space

2. **For Cognitive Scientists:**
   - Meaning = Map construction from observations
   - Inference = Compass guidance through state space
   - Integrating Meaning and Inference = Rational meaning construction on probabilistic program

# World Model <> Startup Adaptation: Operationalizing Environment-Agent Dynamics

## Core Framework
The startup lifecycle shows distinct patterns of co-evolution between environment (epigenetic) and agent (genetic) characteristics across developmental stages.

### Table 1: Fundamental Dynamics at Each Stage

| Stage | Environmental Pattern | Agent Response | Key Integration Challenge |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Nailer** | Problem-centric, fast-moving | Generalist, experimental | Matching agent flexibility with environmental volatility |
| **Scaler** | Process-centric, structured | Specialist, systematic | Balancing standardization with adaptability |
| **Sailor** | System-centric, stabilized | Super-specialist, disciplined | Maintaining efficiency without losing innovation |

### Table 2: Transition Mechanisms

| Transition | Environmental Shift | Agent Evolution | Success Indicators |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Nailer → Scaler** | From problems to processes | From generalist to specialist | • Process documentation<br>• Role specialization<br>• Resource allocation systems |
| **Scaler → Sailor** | From processes to systems | From specialist to super-specialist | • Automated workflows<br>• Data-driven decisions<br>• Institutional memory |

### Table 3: Measurement Framework

| Level | Environment Metrics | Agent Metrics | Integration Metrics |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Nailer** | • Problem resolution speed<br>• Customer feedback cycle | • Pivot frequency<br>• Solution diversity | • Problem-solution fit |
| **Scaler** | • Process efficiency<br>• Resource utilization | • Capability development<br>• Knowledge systematization | • Process-capability alignment |
| **Sailor** | • System stability<br>• Operational efficiency | • Role specialization<br>• Rule adherence | • System-competency fit |


| Aspect | Products 1/2 (Operational-Financial) | Products 3/4 (Environmental-Adaptive) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Core Focus** | Resource allocation optimization | Evolution and adaptation |
| **Time Horizon** | Medium-term planning cycles | Long-term evolutionary trajectories |
| **Key Question** | "How to optimize given constraints?" | "How to adapt as constraints evolve?" |
| **Decision Level** | Tactical resource deployment | Strategic capability development |
| **Success Metric** | Efficiency of resource use | Fitness for environment |
| **Risk Management** | Portfolio optimization | Adaptive resilience |
| **Learning Mode** | Deliberate experimentation | Natural selection |
| **Value Creation** | Through operational excellence | Through evolutionary fit |
| **Constraint View** | Fixed resources to allocate | Evolving capability boundaries |
| **Change Driver** | Intentional optimization | Environmental pressure |

- Represents the highest-level integration between operational optimization (12) and evolutionary adaptation (34) - how startups must simultaneously solve the resource-business optimization problem while adapting to and shaping their evolving environments. This meta-level integration shows how operational choices and evolutionary pressures interact: operational capabilities enable or constrain how firms can adapt, while evolutionary pressures shape what operational capabilities are valuable to develop. This creates a rich dynamic where firms must balance deliberate optimization with adaptive evolution.
- connect dynamic capability with process noise ([[Process noise and Feature noise]])
- rational meaning construction of entrepreneurship
