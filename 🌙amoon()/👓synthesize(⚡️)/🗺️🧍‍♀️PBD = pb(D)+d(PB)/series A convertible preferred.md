A merger, consolidation (other than one in which the holders of capital stock of the Company prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 51% by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving entity), sale or exclusive license of all, substantially all or a significant portion of the assets or intellectual property of the Company shall be deemed to be a liquidation event.

3. Optional Conversion: The holders of Series A Preferred shall have the right to convert the Series A Preferred, at the option of the holder, at any time, into shares of Common Stock. One share of Series A Preferred shall initially be convertible into one share of Common Stock.

5. Antidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A Preferred (the "Series A Conversion Price") shall be subject to adjustment to prevent dilution in the event that the Company issues additional shares of Common Stock or any right or option to purchase, or any other security convertible into, Common Stock (other than shares issued to employees, consultants or directors in accordance with plans approved by the Board of Directors) at a purchase price less than the then applicable Series A Conversion Price. In such an event, the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted to such lesser purchase price.

Pay-to-Play: If the company issues shares of its capital stock in a future financing for a consideration per share less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance (a "Dilutive Issuance"), and an Investor has the right to purchase its pro rata share of such Dilutive Issuance and Investor does not purchase such pro rata share, then the shares of Series A Preferred then held by such Investor shall be converted into Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

7. Drag-Along Rights: If (i) any person or entity offers to acquire all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and (ii) such transaction is approved by 51% of the voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred then held by all Investors, then the Founders and each holder of Series A Preferred shall be obligated to vote all of his, her or its shares in favor of such transaction.

Redemption Provisions: Shares of Series A Preferred shall be redeemed by the Company in three equal annual installments (as legally permissible) at any time, commencing 60 days after receipt by the Company from the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A Preferred. The redemption price shall be the Liquidation Preference plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

10. Voting Rights: Each share of Series A Preferred shall represent that number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series A Preferred. The Series A Preferred and Common Stock shall vote together as a class except (i) the Series A Preferred as a class shall be entitled to elect three members of the Board of Directors (the "Series A Directors"), (ii) as required by law, and (iii) as set forth in Section 11 below.
