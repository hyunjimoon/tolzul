Using previously unexplored custodial data, we examine the use of alternative investment vehicles (AVs) in private equity over four decades. By 2017, AVs reached 40% of all PE commitments. Average AV performance matches the PE market, but underperforms the main funds of the partnerships sponsoring AVs. LPs with better past performance invest in AVs with better average performance, even after conditioning on the GPs’ past records. This result is largely driven by preferential access of top LPs to top AVs. As a result, returns in PE increasingly depend on the match between GPs and LPs and both parties’ outside options.
