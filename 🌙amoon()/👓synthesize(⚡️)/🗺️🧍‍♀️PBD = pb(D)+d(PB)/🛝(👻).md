Rational Meaning Construction in Venture Investment Decisions
1. Research Gap: 
   - VCs make high-stakes decisions with limited information
   - Map from observable → unobservable qualities unclear
   - Heterogeneity across investor types not well understood

2. Core Research Questions:
   - How do observable startup features map to investor perceptions?
   - How does this mapping vary by investor expertise/type?
   - Why do identical startups receive different valuations?
----
Key Building Blocks
1. Theoretical Foundation:
   - VCs prioritize (Gompers 2020):
     - Management team (95%)
     - Business model (83%) 
     - Product/tech (74%)
     - Market (68%)

2. Horse vs Jockey (Kaplan 2009):
   - Business model rarely changes (2%)
   - Management turnover common (56%)
   - "Horse" more stable than "jockey"

3. Rational Meaning Model:
   - Observable features → Perceptual dimensions
   - Heterogeneous across investor types
----
Novel Methodology
1. Hierarchical Bayesian Framework
   - Observable (X) → Perceptual (P) → Choice
   - Model two key dimensions:
     - Business model validity
     - Team execution capability

2. LLM-Based Data Collection:
   - Generate synthetic investor profiles
   - Systematic exploration of responses
   - Maps observable → perceptual dimensions

3. Experimental Design:
   - Pick-any-J tasks (perceptions)
   - Choice tasks (decisions)
   - Overlapping designs for identification
----
Implementation
1. Observable Characteristics:
   - Team composition/background
   - Technical capabilities
   - Market focus/size
   - Revenue/growth metrics
   - IP/patents

2. Perceptual Inferences:
   - Business model viability
   - Team execution ability
   - Market understanding
   - Product-market fit

3. Model Structure:
   - Multivariate probit (perceptions)
   - Multinomial logit (choices)
   - Hierarchical priors (investor types)

Research Contributions
1. Theoretical:
   - Framework for rational meaning in VC
   - Understanding heterogeneous lay theories
   - Links observables to valuations

2. Methodological:
   - Novel LLM-based profiling
   - Hierarchical Bayesian approach
   - Systematic perception mapping

3. Practical Applications:
   - Guide entrepreneur pitch strategy
   - Improve investor-startup matching
   - Explain valuation disparities

The slides are now structured around the theoretical foundation, methodology, and contributions outlined in the table of contents and abstract. I've maintained focus on the three key components:
1. How investors form lay theories
2. Model adaptation for venture context
3. Both research and practical implications

Would you like me to adjust anything about the structure or content?
