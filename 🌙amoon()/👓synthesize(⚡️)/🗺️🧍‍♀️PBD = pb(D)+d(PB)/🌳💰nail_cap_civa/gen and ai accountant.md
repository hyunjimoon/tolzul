Can they successfully complete FDA approval without changing their strategy (i.e., no in-sourcing, no more funding)? Do you think MedTech should in-source some of the manufacturing, or spend all the cash that the VC has to offer to finance current operations? Is there an optimum balance that can be achieved where all the parties have aligned interests?<br>3. Do you think MediTech's current path is consistent with a long-term strategy toward mass production?<br>- What alternatives are there?<br>- What are the trade-offs inherent in the operations decisions faced by the company?<br>- How are these decisions different for a startup as opposed to a large corporation?<br>- How might this affect strategy in marketing, design, and engineering?<br>- What would you recommend? | ![[Pasted image 20240612070554.png]] |
