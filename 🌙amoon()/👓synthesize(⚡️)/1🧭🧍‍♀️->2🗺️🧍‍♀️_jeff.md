angie's analysis of how this can be approached with rational meaning construction. based on below, please explain what you learned and update your answer above   [applying RMC] I constructed meanings of stan code in the language of rational meaning construction (RMC). I color-coded the five modules in the attached pipeline.   1. understand language (constructing meaning) of your paper, defined as inferring probability distributions over expressions in internal PLOT, conditioned on goals, observation, communicative context.   Labeled train sets of {natural language (NL) your paper), probabilistic language of thought (PLOT) stan code)}, can help me transfer meaning function that maps NL to PLOT in equity valuation communication context.   *2. *Using 1, I intend to develop tools to help founders THINK given term sheet i.e. [1] *construct programs that represent probabilistic world models, and perform inference in these models _[2]_ to predict and plan, explain and evaluate, learn and teach, *[3] *conditioned on goals, observations, and background knowledge. *   [1] construct stan programs that represent probabilistic world models of equity valuation, and perform inference on attributes like {how much control I'm losing, how fair this deal is, how good fit the founder-investor has, how valuable founder's idea is}.    [2] to predict and plan equity valuation, explain and evaluate the meaning of a term sheet, learn and teach capitalize operations during scaling (or nailing)   [3] conditioned on goals (producing product2), observations (unpacking perception is relevant to RMC),  and background knowledge (Stan syntax, entrepreneurship domain knowledge, angie's research plan).
