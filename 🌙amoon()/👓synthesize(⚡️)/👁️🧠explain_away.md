In the Mach illusion, our perception emerges from complex interactions between environmental lighting (🌏), physical properties (surface reflectance 🔴 and 3D shape 🟩), and observable features (shading 🔷 and contours ⭐️). While these factors are physically independent - like theater designers can independently control lighting, paint, and set geometry - they become coupled in our perception through explaining away. For example, when strong contour evidence (⭐️) suggests a 3D shape (🟩), our brain attributes shading patterns (🔷) to that shape rather than surface reflectance (🔴), even though both could cause similar patterns. This coupling can be manipulated through various experimental conditions like covering edges, using one-eye viewing, or changing lighting direction, demonstrating how our brain performs sophisticated probabilistic inference to interpret visual scenes.

**Unified Explanation:**
Just as the Mach illusion shows how strong contour evidence (⭐️) of shape (🟩) explains away our interpretation of shading patterns (🔷), the A2S ratio structure explains away seemingly irrational execution speeds. When we observe different speeds across agents (🔷), what appears as irrational behavior (🔴) is actually explained by underlying cost constraints (🟩) shaped by environmental conditions (🌏). This explains why apparently "irrational" quick execution by some agents may be optimal given their specific A2S constraints.


### example of d()/d(A2S)

| Cost Type | Example | A2S Change | Observed Execution Pattern | Explanation |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Action Cost Differences** ||||
| 1. Private vs Public Equity | High A2S | Slower execution despite strong signals | High action costs (complex deals) force careful execution even with clear information |
| 2. HFT vs Traditional Trading | Low A2S | Rapid execution despite uncertainty | Low action costs (automation) enable quick trades even with limited information |
| **Sampling Cost Differences** ||||
| 3. Wealth vs Poverty | Varies | Wealthy: slower, deliberate<br>Poor: faster, decisive | Sampling costs higher for poor (limited access) explaining quicker but less-informed decisions |
| 4. Desert vs City | High vs Low | Desert: quicker, less precise<br>City: measured, informed | High sampling costs in desert explain faster execution despite equal action costs |
| 5. Voting with/without Misinformation | Varies | More rapid decisions in high misinformation | Increased sampling costs from misinformation lead to faster, less-researched choices |

**Unified Pattern:**
Like how lighting (🌏) and shape (🟩) in Mach's illusion create shading patterns (🔷) that appear paradoxical, variations in A2S ratios create execution patterns that might seem irrational. When action costs dominate (PE/HFT), behavior follows action constraints. When sampling costs vary (wealth/location/information), execution speed inversely tracks sampling difficulty. This explains away apparently irrational quick execution as optimal responses to cost structures.

figure in ![[explain_away]]🟩quality of idea and 🔴execution observed as 🔴(🟩)

given 🌏lighting, 🔴reflectance and 🟩shape affects observed 🔷shading and ⭐️contour

Explaining away occurs when multiple independent causes of an observed effect become correlated in our posterior beliefs after observing evidence. In the Mach illusion, when we observe both 🔷 shading and ⭐️contour, our brain has to attribute these patterns to either 🔴reflectance or 🟩 shape. 

When strong ⭐️contour evidence suggests a particular 🟩 shape interpretation, it "explains away" the 🔷 shading variations as being caused by 🟩shape rather than 🔴reflectance changes, even though physically these properties are independent.

**Core Mechanism:** 
Just as strong contour evidence in Mach's illusion explains away surface reflectance interpretation, evidence of environmental A2S constraints explains away apparent entrepreneurial irrationality. When we understand how A2S ratios vary across contexts (high for PE, low for HFT), seemingly irrational behavior patterns (quick vs delayed execution) are revealed as optimal strategic responses.

explain away: information flow in the posterior

The key insight is that while rationality and environmental structure (R) are independent a priori, they become coupled in our posterior beliefs when we observe sampling behavior (K), creating the explaining away effect.

![[PRK_explain_away]]

First, industry clockspeed (the rate at which products, processes, and organizational structures change) appears to have multiple independent root causes: modularity of product architecture (📦), R&D investment levels (💰), competitive pressure (📍), industry architecture (🏛️), development capabilities (💪), and revenue dynamics (💹). However, just as in the Mach illusion where apparent surface properties can be explained by either reflectance or shape, observed industry clockspeed could be driven by either technological-structural factors (modularity, R&D, pressure) or organizational-economic factors (industry architecture, capabilities, revenue). The challenge is that these factors, while theoretically independent, become deeply coupled in our observations through explaining away effects.

This explaining away mechanism suggests a novel approach to untangling causality: rather than trying to isolate individual factors, we should look for situations where new evidence about one set of factors (e.g., observing changes in industry architecture) systematically changes our interpretation of the role of other factors (e.g., the apparent impact of modularity on clockspeed). Just as understanding lighting conditions in the Mach illusion helps disambiguate shape from reflectance, understanding how changes in organizational-economic factors alter the apparent influence of technological-structural factors (and vice versa) may reveal the true causal structure driving industry clockspeed. This could involve studying natural experiments where one set of factors shifts while others remain relatively constant.
