with [[matin_ghavami]]
Angie discussed the importance of aligning mental models in collaboration and the value of frequent meetings. explored the application of statistical principles in problem-solving, referencing Josh's class and the Pinocchio principle. Matin expressed interest in advanced probability theory courses, particularly at Harvard, and discussed the relevance of stochastic processes in decision-making. Angie proposed a model comparing incumbents and entrants, emphasizing the impact of decision-making speed and precision on market dynamics. The conversation also touched on the integration of precision in decision-making models and the potential for using Markov decision processes to analyze these dynamics.
