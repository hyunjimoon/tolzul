Abstract: This chapter focuses at the dynamics of technological change. It speci?cally asks whether technological change occurs in leaps and bounds, or whether it takes place gradually and continuously. The chapter sets up an analogy between technological progress and biological evolution, and tries to apply the concept of punctuated equilibrium to the analysis of technology. It observes that one concept that has been employed in the economics of growth is the steady state, a form of growth which is itself constant and predictable, and thus can be regarded as a dynamic equivalent to the concept of equilibrium. The chapter opines that it would seem natural to think of the steady state as an evolutionary process.

Keywords:  technological change, dynamics, analogy, technological progress, biological evolution, punctuated equilibrium, steady state, evolutionary process

"$\color{Red}{macroinventions}$ are more difficult to understand, and seem to be governed by individual genius and luck as much as by economic forces."
"Without $\color{Green}{microinventions}$, most $\color{Red}{macroinventions}$ would not be implemented and their economic rents not realized. But without  $\color{Red}{macroinventions}$ , what would there be to improve?" (complementarity)
"Some societies were less receptive to radical changes than others... The conservative forces failed to stop the great scientific achievements of the seventeenth century, but not for lack of trying." (environmental)

when to choose parallel search strategies
- There's potential for breakthrough innovations that can create new technological "species"
- The environment can support radical change
- The innovation space isn't constrained by local conditions
- Social and institutional factors are supportive of major changes
