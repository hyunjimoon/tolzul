The concept of pivoting in startups also closely relates to the notion of
exaptation in both biology and business. Exaptation refers to the process
where a trait or feature evolves to serve one function but is later co-opted for
a different purpose. In the context of startups, a product or service might
initially be developed for a specific use but, through market feedback and
iterative development, might find a more valuable application in a different
market or context. This parallels the epigenetic landscape, where cells might
reprogram or redirect their developmental pathways in response to external
cues, highlighting the importance of flexibility and responsiveness to change.
Both concepts underscore the significance of adaptive processes in achieving
successful outcomes, whether in biological development or entrepreneurial
ventures; jb's structure: 1. 🎯adaptation (🛠️exaptation + cooption), 2. co-opted adaptation, 3. 🏛️spandrels with story line as🎯 (original adaptation) ↓ 🏛️ (byproduct features emerge) ↓ 🎨 (creative reuse) ↓ 🛠️ (functional repurposing)
