The concept of ‚ÄùPivot‚Äù in innovation is akin to Waddington‚Äôs epigenetic
landscape in developmental biology, where a cell‚Äôs fate is determined by its
interactions with its environment, and it may need to ‚Äùpivot‚Äù or change di-
rection based on these interactions. In a startup context, a pivot involves
re-evaluating and altering the business model, product, or strategy to bet-
ter align with market demands, which is essential for survival and growth
in a dynamic market landscape. This adaptation process is underpinned by
continuous learning and experimentation, much like how cells in Wadding-
ton‚Äôs model adapt to genetic but also to environmental signals to find their
optimal developmental path.

## why ü¶ã

The butterfly's metamorphosis is a perfect example of epigenetic regulation because:

1. **Environmental Triggers & Gene Expression**
- Temperature and day length trigger hormonal changes
- These environmental signals activate/deactivate specific genes
- Without changing DNA sequence itself, genes are turned "on" or "off"
- Like how a light switch controls a room's lighting without changing the wiring

2. **Developmental Plasticity**
- Same genetic code creates radically different forms (caterpillar ‚Üí butterfly)
- Different genes are expressed at different life stages
- Environmental conditions can influence timing and success of transformation
- Similar to how startups might pivot based on market conditions

3. **Cellular Memory & Timing**
- Cells "remember" their developmental stage through chemical markers
- These markers determine which genes should be active at what time
- Once triggered, the process follows a coordinated sequence
- Comparable to how organizational change requires coordinated timing

4. **Hormone Cascades**
- Juvenile hormone and ecdysone control the transformation
- These work like "master switches" for gene expression patterns
- Changes in one area trigger changes throughout the organism
- Similar to how institutional support (s factor in your table) can trigger system-wide changes
