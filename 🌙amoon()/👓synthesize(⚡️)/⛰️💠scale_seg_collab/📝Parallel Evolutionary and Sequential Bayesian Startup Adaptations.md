alternative title: Sequential and Parallel Pivots: Two Exaptive Strategies for Entrepreneurial Innovation

2024-10-26
connecting conditions for spandrel with 'low test cost, low variance within supply and demand, low correlation between supply and demand' being the condition for parallel search, I'd highly recommend¬†[felin_kauffman_zenger21-resource_origins_search.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17530303/Strategic.Management.Journal.-.2021.-.Felin.-.Resource.origins.and.search.pdf)¬†on 'Resource Origins and Search.' Their concept of 'search images' - firm-specific ways of seeing and identifying valuable resources that others might miss - offers valuable insights for our work. Rather than conducting exhaustive search or relying solely on existing endowments, they argue firms can search more effectively by starting with a functional need or problem they aim to solve. This framework could enhance our understanding of when parallel search is optimal, particularly in situations with low test costs (when the search image clearly guides what to look for), low variance (when the search image helps identify specific resource properties), and low correlation (when the search image enables recognition of novel resource combinations). Their perspective on how firms recognize dormant value in resources could help us better formalize the conditions under which parallel search strategies outperform sequential approaches, especially in evolving market environments.

### Abstract
Research Summary:‚Ä®This study investigates the efficacy of parallel versus sequential search strategies in testing value creation hypotheses for entrepreneurial ventures. We develop a Bayesian model using probabilistic programming to compare parallel "test-four-choose-one" and sequential "test-two-choose-one-twice" approaches across various contexts. Our analysis focuses on two key dimensions: technological innovation (component vs. system innovations) and customer segments (existing vs. new users). The study reveals that parallel search tends to outperform sequential search under specific conditions: (1) when the cost of each test is low relative to pivoting costsüí∏, (2) when uncertainty in technological innovations and customer segments is highüé≤, and (3) when the true values of technological innovations and customer segments have low correlationüß©. We also examine industry-specific factors and company-level characteristics that influence the optimal search strategy, providing insights into when entrepreneurs should adopt broad, simultaneous exploration versus more focused, step-by-step approaches.‚Ä®

Managerial Summary:‚Ä®In entrepreneurial ventures, the choice between parallel and sequential search strategies for testing value creation hypotheses depends on industry characteristics and company-specific factors. Parallel search excels in industries with fast clockspeeds, low test costs, high uncertainty, and low correlation between technological innovations and customer segments. For instance, personal computers, toys, and semiconductors benefit from parallel approaches due to their low test costs üí∏, high uncertainty üé≤, and potentially low correlation üß©. Conversely, industries like shipbuilding, petrochemicals, and commercial aircraft favor sequential strategies due to slow clockspeeds and high development costs. However, company-specific factors can override industry norms, as exemplified by Moderna's successful parallel search in the typically sequential pharmaceutical industry. Moderna's mRNA platform enables faster, cheaper development üí∏, operates in a novel, uncertain space üé≤, and has potential applications across various diseases üß©, making parallel search advantageous. This nuanced approach to search strategies enables entrepreneurs to optimize their exploration of technological innovations and customer segments based on their unique context and uncertainties.‚Ä®

### **Introduction: Strategic Experimentation and Pivots in Uncertain Markets**

Entrepreneurs in dynamic markets face the ongoing challenge of balancing exploration with commitment. Key decisions revolve around how much to experiment and when to¬†**pivot**¬†in response to new information, which is often complicated by cognitive biases such as overconfidence. Structured experimentation programs‚Äîthose that carefully manage how many experiments to run and the timing of strategic shifts‚Äîare critical for entrepreneurial success.

Pivots are strategic shifts that startups make when they discover new information or insights, usually in response to market feedback, technological advancements, or internal challenges. A pivot involves changing the business model, product offering, target market, or approach, while retaining the startup‚Äôs core vision or goals. Successful pivots allow startups to avoid stagnation and seize emerging opportunities.

Recent studies (Gans et al., 2019; Stern, 2019) emphasize that while frequent experimentation can spur innovation, excessive pivoting can disrupt learning and harm long-term performance. The Lean Startup model popularized by Eric Ries stresses iterative learning while cautioning against over-pivoting. In light of this, a well-structured experimentation framework mitigates such risks, enabling better-informed decisions.

Central to this framework is the concept of¬†**exaptation**, borrowed from evolutionary biology. Exaptation describes how existing features, originally developed for one function, are repurposed for new, often unanticipated uses (Gould & Vrba, 1982). In the context of entrepreneurial innovation, two types of exaptation emerge: one where a feature previously shaped by selection is co-opted for a new use (adaptation), and another where features not initially shaped by selection are co-opted (nonaptation). These represent¬†**sequential pivots**¬†and¬†**parallel pivots**, respectively. Both are crucial for understanding how startups navigate uncertainty and explore innovation.

### **Parallel and Sequential Search in Experimentation**

Startups typically adopt either¬†**parallel**¬†or¬†**sequential search**¬†strategies in experimentation, each suited to different industry contexts and conducive to distinct exaptive opportunities.

---

#### **Parallel Search: Rapid Innovation through Broad Exploration**

In parallel search, startups run multiple experiments simultaneously, a strategy well-suited for industries characterized by fast-paced development and low testing costs, such as biotechnology, software, and semiconductors. This approach facilitates broad exploration, increasing the likelihood of discovering novel applications for technologies that may not have been originally designed for a particular purpose.

For instance,¬†**Moderna**¬†applied parallel search effectively during its early development of mRNA vaccines. By pursuing several mRNA programs concurrently, Moderna rapidly identified new applications for its platform. This process exemplifies¬†**nonaptation exaptation**, where resources not previously optimized for a specific function are repurposed to meet emerging market needs. Such strategies expand the "adjacent possible" (Kauffman, 1995), enabling startups to discover opportunities quickly and increase entrepreneurial agility.

In high-uncertainty environments, especially for early-stage biotech startups, rapid experimentation facilitates the discovery of exaptive opportunities. This is particularly relevant in sectors where technological breakthroughs and market needs evolve rapidly, making parallel search essential for long-term survival and success.

---

#### **Sequential Search: Methodical Learning through Stepwise Exploration**

Conversely, sequential search follows a linear, methodical approach, where each experiment informs the next step. This approach works best in industries where failure is costly or where each test requires significant investment, such as aerospace and automotive engineering. Startups adopting sequential search can more deeply analyze results from each experiment, gaining greater understanding of their assets before moving forward.

**Tesla**¬†provides a notable example of sequential search. In its early stages, the company focused heavily on refining its battery technology. Each iteration in its electric powertrain design built upon the previous results, eventually expanding into related areas such as home energy storage (Powerwall). Tesla‚Äôs deliberate expansion demonstrates¬†**adaptation exaptation**, where technology optimized for one use (electric vehicles) is adapted to serve broader applications like home energy systems. Sequential pivots allow startups to mitigate risk, ensuring that each strategic shift is based on solid evidence.

While sequential search fosters slower innovation, it enables more informed decisions by allowing startups to carefully evaluate the results of each experiment, reducing uncertainty and facilitating more deliberate pivots.

### **The ‚ÄúTest Two, Choose One‚Äù Rule and Pivot Thresholds**

The "Test Two, Choose One" rule (Gans et al., 2019) offers a practical framework for balancing exploration with decision-making in uncertain environments. This rule encourages entrepreneurs to test two equally viable alternatives simultaneously and select the more promising path based on data. Such structured experimentation reduces the risk of premature commitment to a single strategy and encourages adaptability to emerging opportunities.

In¬†**parallel search**, this rule supports faster pivoting, as new applications of technologies or resources can emerge from simultaneous experiments. For example,¬†**Uber**¬†initially tested both black-car services and peer-to-peer ride-sharing models in parallel. After evaluating customer demand and operational feasibility, the company chose the more scalable peer-to-peer model, which ultimately transformed Uber into a dominant player in the transportation industry.

In¬†**sequential search**, the "Test Two, Choose One" rule encourages more deliberate decision-making. By limiting the number of simultaneous experiments, startups can focus their efforts on one solidified experiment before moving on to the next. Setting clear¬†**pivot thresholds**‚Äîspecific points in an experimental program where decisions must be made based on results‚Äîhelps entrepreneurs avoid the dangers of over-pivoting and ensure that each pivot is grounded in data rather than intuition.

---

### **Behavioral Biases and Entrepreneurial Decision-Making**

Entrepreneurs are often vulnerable to cognitive biases such as¬†**overconfidence**¬†and the¬†**sunk cost fallacy**, which can lead to either excessive experimentation or reluctance to pivot. A structured experimentation program, supported by clear pivot thresholds, can mitigate these biases by enforcing data-driven decision-making processes.

Structured experimentation forces entrepreneurs to rely on empirical evidence rather than gut feeling, helping to avoid emotional attachment to failing strategies. For example, startups in sectors like healthcare or fintech often face these dilemmas, where early indicators may suggest promising avenues that turn out to be dead ends. Establishing clear pivot thresholds helps mitigate the risk of overcommitting to a strategy or technology that is unlikely to succeed.

By incorporating explicit pivot thresholds into both¬†**parallel**¬†and¬†**sequential search**¬†strategies, entrepreneurs can optimize their decision-making process, reducing the likelihood of failure due to cognitive traps and increasing the probability of long-term success.

---

### **Exaptation and the Adjacent Possible**

Exaptation plays a critical role in expanding the¬†**adjacent possible**‚Äîthe set of all future innovations that become accessible based on current conditions (Kauffman, 1995). By repurposing existing resources or technologies, startups can unlock previously unforeseen opportunities and strategically pivot into new markets.

In¬†**parallel search**, startups running multiple experiments simultaneously are more likely to encounter exaptive opportunities, especially for resources or technologies that were not originally designed for their current use. For instance,¬†**CRISPR Therapeutics**¬†began as a tool for bacterial immune systems but was rapidly exapted for use in human gene-editing therapies, enabling the startup to address a variety of diseases from cancer to genetic disorders. This broad exploration uncovers hidden possibilities and allows startups to pivot in response to new market data.

In¬†**sequential search**, exaptive opportunities emerge more gradually, often following a deeper understanding of the technology being repurposed.¬†**Waymo**, Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicle project, initially focused on self-driving technology for ride-hailing services. Over time, as the technology evolved, Waymo incrementally expanded into autonomous delivery, reflecting how sequential pivots uncover new applications over time, grounded in methodical learning.

### **Visualization of Pivot Dynamics and Exaptive Opportunities**

Visualization tools can play a crucial role in tracking how exaptive processes drive entrepreneurial pivots. By visualizing the¬†**adjacent possible**, entrepreneurs can identify emerging opportunities and make informed decisions about how to reconfigure their existing resources.¬†**Mansinghka (2021)**¬†and¬†**Chen et al. (2020)**¬†recommend using dynamic visualizations to track the emergence of exaptive opportunities during parallel and sequential search strategies.

**Monika Blattmeier (2023)**¬†delves deeper into the aestheticization of business processes, emphasizing how visualizing their¬†**Gestalt**¬†can enhance collective decision-making. This visualization approach helps entrepreneurs see the holistic potential of their business models and innovation pathways. Such tools foster collective thinking in startups, helping teams make more informed decisions when navigating pivot dynamics.

---

### **Conclusion: Leveraging Exaptive Strategies for Startup Success**

The ability to pivot effectively is crucial for startups navigating uncertain markets. Both¬†**parallel**¬†and¬†**sequential search**¬†strategies, informed by exaptation, offer valuable frameworks for experimentation and innovation. Parallel search enables rapid discovery of new opportunities, while sequential search fosters deeper, more deliberate learning, reducing the risk associated with each pivot.

By incorporating structured experimentation programs, clear pivot thresholds, and an understanding of the dynamics of exaptation, startups can enhance their ability to innovate and expand their¬†**adjacent possible**. Startups that master these methods are better equipped to discover novel applications for their existing technologies and achieve sustained innovation in dynamic markets.
