| 1. Introduction | Why is the common prior assumption widespread despite its limitations? | • Savage's expected utility theory<br>• Aumann (1987) on common priors | The economics profession relies heavily on common priors but needs a framework to understand when this is/isn't justified | 🧭 Example: Public disagreement exists despite rationality |
| 2. Brief History | How did common prior assumption become central to economic theory? | • Harsanyi's work on games<br>• Aumann (1976) on agreement | Common prior became critical for analyzing asymmetric information and interactive environments | 🌏 Example: Nash equilibrium depends on common knowledge assumptions |
| 3. What Are Prior Beliefs? | What are the different interpretations of probability in economic theory? | • Savage (1954) on subjective probability<br>• von Neumann-Morgenstern utility | Three views of probability: frequentist, personalistic, and logical - each with different implications | 👓 Examples: Coin tosses vs personal weather predictions |
| 4. Justifying Common Priors | What arguments support common prior assumption? | • Logical probability theory<br>• Empirical evidence on learning | Neither rationality nor learning necessarily implies common priors should hold | 🧠 Example: Difficulty justifying common beliefs about unique events |
| 5. Economics Without Common Priors | When can we relax common prior assumption productively? | • Game theory literature<br>• Asset pricing models<br>• Trading volume research | Heterogeneous priors can explain important phenomena while maintaining analytical tractability | 🤜 Examples: Asset bubbles, trading patterns, market anomalies |
