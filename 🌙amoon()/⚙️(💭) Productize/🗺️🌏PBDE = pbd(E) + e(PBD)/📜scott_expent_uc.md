abstract:This paper empirically examines the evaluations of 537 ventures in high-growth industries performed by 251 experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and executives. These experts evaluated ventures by reading succinct summaries of the ventures without meeting the founding teams, and their evaluations were not disclosed to the entrepreneurs. We Ô¨Ånd that experts can differentiate among early-stage ventures on grounds of quality beyond the explicit venture and entrepreneur characteristics contained in the written summaries. They can only do so effectively, however, for ventures in the hardware, energy, life sciences, and medical devices sectors; they cannot do so for ventures in the consumer products, consumer web and mobile, and enterprise software sectors. Our results highlight sectorspeciÔ¨Åc heterogeneity in the information needed to effectively screen ventures, a Ô¨Ånding that has implications for the design of optimal investment strategies.

#### from scott's textbook
The researchers discovered that experts could only effectively evaluate startups in sectors such as hardware, energy, life sciences, and medical devices, while they were not successful in evaluating markets such as consumer products, consumer web and mobile, and enterprise software sectors. According to the researchers, the information needed to assess startups depends on the nature of the uncertainty they face. For example, in cases where the technological uncertainty associated with the startup idea is high relative to the market uncertainty (such as a new insulin treatment), one can evaluate by comparing the idea to successful commercialization of products using similar technologies. However, in situations where market uncertainty is relatively high (such as a new service targeted at enterprise customers), it becomes more difficult to predict consumer behavior.

Aleatoric uncertainty refers to inherent randomness or variability that cannot be reduced, while epistemic uncertainty stems from a lack of knowledge and can potentially be decreased through learning (shakul_superposition). You explored how these types of uncertainty apply to entrepreneurship:

1. Aleatoric uncertainty in entrepreneurship:
- Often associated with market forces or external factors beyond an entrepreneur's control
- Example: The outcome of the 2020 U.S. election, which was described as being close to a coin flip with a probability near 0.5 (üëªjeff<>angie|divide conquer slide)
- Weather prediction beyond 14 days, where randomness dominates despite technological advancements

2. Epistemic uncertainty in entrepreneurship:
- Related to lack of knowledge about a product, market, or strategy
- Can be reduced through research, experimentation, and learning
- Example: Tesla's battery technology, where initial uncertainty about its applications was reduced as they explored new markets like home energy storage (üëªjeff<>angie|divide conquer slide)

You discussed how the ratio of aleatoric to epistemic uncertainty (A/E ratio) changes as entrepreneurs gather more information:
- As measurement technology improves, aleatoric uncertainty tends to decrease while epistemic uncertainty increases (üëªjeff<>angie|divide conquer slide)
- This shift represents a transformation of previously "unknowable" factors into potentially learnable information

You and Jeff explored how this concept applies to decision-making in startups:
- Entrepreneurs often face situations with high epistemic uncertainty, where more learning and experimentation can be beneficial
- In contrast, situations with high aleatoric uncertainty may not benefit as much from additional sampling or research
- 
Examples you discussed include:
1. Tesla vs BYD: Tesla's deliberate exploration of battery technology for EVs and home storage represents a reduction of epistemic uncertainty. BYD's unexpected success in EVs due to their blade battery design (originally created for safety regulations) illustrates how aleatory uncertainty can lead to unforeseen opportunities (üëªjeff<>angie|coding and uncertainty in innovation).
2. Pharmaceutical screening: The process of drug discovery involves reducing epistemic uncertainty through systematic testing and experimentation (tom <> angie|bayesSD).
3. Dating apps: The process of matching users involves both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in human compatibility) and epistemic uncertainty (which can be reduced through better algorithms and data collection) (tom <> angie|bayesSD).
    

You and Jeff also discussed how understanding these types of uncertainty could inform entrepreneurial strategies:
- For high epistemic uncertainty situations, a sequential testing approach might be more appropriate
- For high aleatoric uncertainty, parallel testing or broader exploration might be beneficial

Lastly, you explored how investors might evaluate startups based on these uncertainty types, suggesting that equity valuation could be seen as a measurement process that helps distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in a venture's potential (üëªjeff<>angie|coding and uncertainty in innovation).

## Summary of E/A Ratio and Scott's Paper Application
extracted from [eval(jeff, E/A) cld](https://claude.ai/chat/b55ae178-5ee2-4392-9e18-6f37bad3b60c)

E/A (Epistemic/Aleatoric) Ratio:
From the transcript, the E/A ratio represents the relationship between epistemic uncertainty (reducible through learning) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness). The conversation suggests that this ratio is dynamic - as people learn more about a domain, what initially appears as aleatoric uncertainty can sometimes be revealed as epistemic uncertainty that can be reduced through learning.

Application in Scott's Paper:
The paper examines venture evaluations across different sectors and finds that the E/A ratio varies significantly by industry type:
- High E/A Ratio: Found in hardware, energy, life sciences, and medical devices sectors, where uncertainty is primarily epistemic and can be reduced through technical evaluation and learning
- Low E/A Ratio: Found in consumer products and web/mobile sectors, where market uncertainty (aleatoric) plays a larger role and is harder to reduce through learning alone

2. Table Interpretation:

The table compares two types of startups across several dimensions:

Hard-Tech/Life Sciences Startups:
- Primarily face epistemic uncertainty that can be reduced through learning
- Evaluation can rely on scientific principles and known technology analogies
- Uncertainty reduction is more straightforward as learning converts unknowns into measurable parameters
- Expert predictions are more reliable due to reducible technological uncertainty
- Higher E/A ratio makes parallel exploration more valuable until sufficient learning occurs

Consumer Web/Market-Driven Startups:
- Face both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, with significant market behavior unpredictability
- Limited stable references for evaluation
- Uncertainty reduction is more difficult due to constant market shifts
- Expert predictions are less reliable due to persistent market uncertainty
- Lower E/A ratio makes even parallel exploration less effective for reducing overall uncertainty

This framework suggests different strategic approaches are needed based on the type of uncertainty dominant in each sector.
