mock title: Regulatory Challenges in Physical vs Digital Transportation: Evidence from EV and AV Industries

The divergent regulatory efficacy between electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) illuminates fundamental challenges in digital domain regulation. While EV regulation succeeds through known physical states (battery capacity, charging rates, safety standards), AV regulation struggles with joint inference of uncertain mental states across multiple agents. Analyzing regulatory outcomes across 50 states from 2015-2023, we find EV regulations achieve 85% compliance through direct physical measurements, while AV regulations show only 30% effectiveness due to fundamental uncertainty in multi-agent behavioral validation. We argue this gap stems from psychological characteristics of digital systems - where mental states must be jointly inferred across agents, making traditional point-prediction regulatory frameworks ineffective. Our findings suggest process integration (standardizing development protocols) must precede product integration (standardizing behavior) for effective digital regulation.
