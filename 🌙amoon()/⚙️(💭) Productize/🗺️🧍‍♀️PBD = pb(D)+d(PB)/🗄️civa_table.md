Explanation of the table, incorporating Bayesian benefits:

1. Computational theory (Level 1):
   - Inputs: Expanded to potentially include termsheet and captable data, allowing for richer model inputs
   - Outputs: A hierarchical Bayesian model that can capture firm-level heterogeneity in valuations
   - Goal: Create a baseline hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for firm-specific effects in startup equity valuation
   - Logic: Use Bayesian inference to model uncertainty, update beliefs based on data, and capture firm-specific effects

2. Representation and algorithm (Level 2):
   - Representation: Hierarchical probabilistic distributions, allowing for modeling of both population-level and firm-specific effects
   - Processing: 
     - Bayesian updating to incorporate new data and adjust model parameters
     - MCMC sampling for posterior inference, enabling robust estimation of complex distributions
     - Hierarchical modeling to account for nested data structures, capturing differences across industries, stages, or time periods

3. Hardware implementation (Level 3):
   - Implementation using specialized Bayesian software (Stan or Gen) optimized for hierarchical models, enabling efficient computation of complex Bayesian structures

This updated table and explanation incorporate key benefits of Bayesian modeling as discussed in the MacKeyDotson24 paper, particularly:

1. The ability to model firm-level heterogeneity through hierarchical structures
2. Robust handling of uncertainty through probabilistic representations
3. Flexibility in incorporating various data sources (e.g., termsheets, captables)
4. Capacity for updating beliefs as new data becomes available

These features position the BMEV model as a more sophisticated baseline that can capture some of the complexities in startup valuation, while still leaving room for improvement by more advanced methods like CIVA.
