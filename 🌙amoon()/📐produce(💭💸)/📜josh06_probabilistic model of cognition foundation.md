| The Paradox    | 🧍‍♀️ How can cognition be probabilistic if people are poor at explicit probability judgments?     | • Research on probabilistic fallacies [2]<br>• Studies of numerical probability judgments                             | Humans often struggle with explicit probabilistic reasoning and numerical probability judgments, seemingly contradicting the idea that cognition is probabilistic              | • Poor performance on probability math problems<br>• Difficulty with numerical probability estimates |
| The Resolution | 🧭 Why doesn't poor explicit probabilistic reasoning contradict implicit probabilistic processing? | • Research on implicit vs explicit processing<br>• Studies of optimized cognitive systems                             | Just as people struggle with Fourier analysis despite using it in vision/hearing, difficulty with explicit probability doesn't mean probability isn't fundamental to cognition | • Vision systems using probabilistic processing<br>• Motor control showing optimal performance       |
| The Evidence   | 🌏 Where do we see successful probabilistic processing in cognition?                               | • Covariation assessment studies [23,25]<br>• Causal reasoning research [49,50]<br>• Everyday prediction studies [51] | Humans show optimal probabilistic processing in well-practiced, ecologically relevant domains rather than abstract probability problems                                        | • Accurate causal judgments<br>• Good everyday predictions<br>• Effective motor control              |

The key insight is that cognitive systems can implement sophisticated probabilistic computations without requiring conscious access or explicit mathematical understanding of probability theory. This explains why humans can be poor at formal probability problems while showing optimal probabilistic processing in naturalistic tasks.
