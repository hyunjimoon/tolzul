# Productize: Computing & Evaluating Quality

**Process and product achieve consistency here.** In this middle orbital domain, I transform theoretical insights into computational tools and frameworks that evaluate entrepreneurial quality.

## Core Approaches

- **Scalable Analytics**: Developing systems that maintain consistency and reliability across different scales of operation
- **Computational Evaluation**: Building tools that quantify quality in entrepreneurial decisions
- **Applied Bayesian Methods**: Translating statistical theory into practical applications for business and operations

## Key Projects

- **NextOpt Analytics Consultancy**: Founded company dedicated to optimizing operational decisions through Bayesian methods
- **Stan Implementation**: Contributed to probabilistic programming language development for statistical modeling
- **SBC (Simulation-Based Calibration)**: Developed methodology to verify the accuracy of approximate Bayesian computation

## Applications

- Entrepreneurial decision support systems
- Operational risk assessment frameworks
- Quality evaluation metrics for innovation processes
- Statistical toolkits for business intelligence

The productization domain serves as the crucial bridge between theoretical ideas from [[ðŸ’­theorize(ðŸ’¸)]] and their ultimate value assessment in [[def(ðŸ’¸Evaluate)]]. As the middle orbit, it moves at a balanced pace, transforming abstract concepts into tangible tools.

_"The value of an idea lies in the using of it."_
