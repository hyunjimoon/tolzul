#### The Clockspeed Concept

I began to look at other industries, seeking to understand their various rates of evolution. I came to think of these rates as industry clockspeeds. Each industry evolved at a different rate, depending in some way on its product clockspeed, process clockspeed, and organization clockspeed.

The information-entertainment industry, for instance, is one of the fastest-clockspeed fruit flies of the business world. Its products -- motion pictures for example -- can have half-lives measured in hours, if not days. The biggest returns, for instance, often come from launching a successful product during the Christmas season when the number of viewers is greatest and when a movie can make an impression just before members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominate films for their annual awardfest. In December, 1997, for example, the major U.S. movie studios and many of the most luminous American directors collectively launched almost $400 million worth of movies on a single Friday evening, with ‚Äútheir fates to be a settled issue by Saturday night,‚Äù according to one commentator.

Process clockspeeds in the information-entertainment industry are similarly breathtaking. We learn almost daily of new processes and services for delivering information content to the home, office, or mobile work station. Organizational dynamics are turbulent as well. Relationships among such media giants as Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, Inc., and Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs News Corporation are routinely negotiated, signed, sealed, and renegotiated in hardly more time than it takes a fruit fly to become a grandparent.

Somewhat slower, semiconductors have a clockspeed measured in years rather than months. An Intel microprocessor product family such as the Pentium II has a market life of two to four years. As for its process clockspeeds, each time Intel sinks a billion dollars into building yet another microprocessor super-factory, it expects much of that investment to be obsolete in little more than four years. That gives Intel a four-year window to recoup its billion dollars in capital, plus a return on that investment.

Moving at an even slower clockspeed, the automobile companies typically refresh their car and truck models every four to eight years. In the process domain, they expect that a billion dollars invested in an engine or assembly plant will remain vibrant for 20 years or more.

At the slowest end of the clockspeed scale -- up there with the sea turtles and the California redwoods -- are the manufacturers of aircraft. The Boeing Company, for instance, measures its products‚Äô clockspeeds in decades. Mega-profits still flow from sales of its venerable 747 jumbo jet 30 years after its launch. The 747s produced in the 1990s rely on the same basic design and the same manufacturing plant that rolled out the first of these aircraft almost three decades ago. Elsewhere in the slow-clockspeed aircraft industry, Lockheed-Martin was working diligently in 1997 to design a warplane that was not expected to go into production before 2008.
