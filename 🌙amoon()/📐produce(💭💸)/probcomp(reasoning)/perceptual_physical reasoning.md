# Perceptual-Physical Reasoning in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

## Definition and Key Concepts

Perceptual-physical reasoning involves understanding how the physical world works, perceiving the environment accurately, and using that understanding to guide decisions. In entrepreneurial contexts, it refers to how entrepreneurs perceive and interpret data about their market, technology, and resources to build accurate mental models of their business environment.

Key components include:

- **State Perception**: Accurately sensing the current state of the environment
- **Causal Physics**: Understanding cause-effect relationships in physical and business systems
- **Environmental Modeling**: Building accurate representations of how the world works
- **Signal Processing**: Distinguishing meaningful signals from noise in data

## Examples from Angie Moon's Presentation

### The Environment Function

Angie introduces the concept of the "Environment" function as part of the fundamental equation of rational agency:

"Environment(a, s): This models how the entrepreneur's actions (a) and their perception of the world state (s) interact to produce outcomes. The world state includes observations about market opportunities, competition, risks, customer needs, technological opportunities, and operational constraints. Inference (calibration) happens during perception."

This highlights how perceptual-physical reasoning involves accurately perceiving the state of the environment and understanding how actions interact with that environment to produce outcomes.

### Perception and Information Selectivity

Angie discusses how entrepreneurs selectively perceive information based on their current hypotheses:

"Based on the model they have, they would selectively get the information, not from the pure data."

When Scott asks for clarification on what "selectively" means, Angie explains:

"So, for instance, they are focusing on, like, I want to know whether 10% of the people are interested or not, so they wouldn't somehow process the information that, like space industry is going somewhere or some of that is unrelated to this hypothesis. They're less interested in the point."

This illustrates how perceptual-physical reasoning in entrepreneurship is guided by existing models and hypotheses, creating a selective attention mechanism.

### Mental Model Precision and States

Angie discusses how entrepreneurs' perception of the state space evolves:

"I think most of the people somehow chooses their kind of best rational action as they go through but I haven't seen any model that grows from implicit and uncalibrated assumptions in distinguishable... state and action between different variables and some mushy utility. Imagine you're just, you just founded a startup yesterday. I don't think you... can distinguish a lot of state and action. You can change everything in the world, but after a few years, if you succeed, you would have some calibrated mental model, which we call prior distribution, and you have clear action and state what you need to do, and a little structured utility compared to the very first."

This describes how entrepreneurs' perceptual-physical reasoning evolves from imprecise ("mushy") perceptions to more calibrated and precise models of states and actions as they gain experience.

### Apartment Search Example

Scott Stern provides a clear example of perceptual-physical reasoning in an apartment search scenario:

"Suppose you're about to go search for an apartment, right? You're moving to a new city, and you don't know much about it, right? There'd be two ways you could to approach that. You could sort of look around and say, Oh, I think I want a two bedroom apartment and around this budget, and go immediately to those and then you get you sample enough apartments, and you feel like you get to know, right, what a two bedroom apartment looks like. Another would be that the first things you visit is a $2,500 apartment and a $1,500 apartment, right? And that way you understand the gradient of right from there, and then when you visit the $2,000 apartment, you understand what you're saving money on and what you're not."

This example illustrates how perceptual-physical reasoning can involve strategically sampling different points in the environment to build a more accurate mental model of the state space.

## Truth and Models

Angie makes a philosophical point about perceptual truth:

"I don't believe in truth. I only believe in true model. And when we say, more sample, the more closer to true it becomes. The full sentence is the estimator, which is a function of optimal solution function that connects from observed data to some random variable. That's the definition of the estimator. So estimator converges to the true model as the sample increases. But the problem here is we don't even know what the true model is, because we don't know we don't have the integrated model of founder, investor and customer and competition."

This highlights how perceptual-physical reasoning in entrepreneurship isn't about accessing some objective truth but rather about building increasingly accurate models of the environment through strategic perception and information gathering.

## Application in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

Perceptual-physical reasoning helps entrepreneurs to:

1. **Develop Accurate Mental Models**: Create better representations of how markets and technologies work
2. **Design Informative Experiments**: Structure tests to provide maximum information about the environment
3. **Distinguish Signal from Noise**: Focus on meaningful patterns rather than random fluctuations
4. **Predict System Behavior**: Anticipate how changes in one part of the business ecosystem will affect others
5. **Calibrate Perceptions**: Continuously refine how they sense and interpret information from the environment

For entrepreneurs, perceptual-physical reasoning provides the foundation upon which probabilistic, relational, and social reasoning can operate effectively. Without accurate perception and modeling of the environment, other forms of reasoning would be built on faulty premises.
