# Entrepreneurial Intelligence Framework Using Probabilistic Programs

## Core Relationship Matrix

The table below maps the fundamental relationships between rational agency equation components, entrepreneurial axioms, cognitive functions, and probabilistic processes.

|Equation Component|Entrepreneurial Axiom|Cognitive Function|Backward Process p(Œ∏\|y)|Forward Process p(y\|Œ∏)|Probabilistic Implementation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Utility()**|**Freedom**: There is more than one path to create and capture value from an idea|**Simplifying**: Reducing the solution space to manageable options|Updating beliefs about value creation opportunities based on market feedback|Predicting which value propositions will resonate with stakeholders|Bayesian utility functions that adapt to new evidence about customer preferences|
|**argmax**|**Constraint**: Resource constraints prevent pursuing all alternatives simultaneously|**Choosing**: Selecting optimal resource allocation|Learning which resource allocations maximize returns based on outcomes|Forecasting returns from specific resource allocations|Monte Carlo methods to sample from possible resource allocation strategies|
|**E[]**|**Uncertainty**: The probability of an idea's value is not known to the entrepreneur|**Probabilistic Reasoning**: Quantifying and reasoning about uncertainty|Revising probability distributions over outcomes as new data arrives|Generating predictive distributions over future outcomes|Probabilistic graphical models representing interdependent business uncertainties|
|**Environment(a, s)**|**Irreversibility/Noisy Learning**: Commitment-free learning can only generate noisy estimates|**Calibrating**: Adjusting models based on feedback|Refining environment models as actions reveal system dynamics|Simulating how actions will affect the business environment|Stochastic process models capturing environment dynamics and feedback loops|

## Reasoning Types Integration

|Reasoning Type|Application in Framework|Implementation in Probabilistic Programs|
|---|---|---|
|**Probabilistic Reasoning**|Bayesian updating of beliefs based on evidence|MCMC sampling, variational inference, and Bayesian networks|
|**Relational Reasoning**|Understanding hierarchical relationships between decisions|Hierarchical Bayesian models and probabilistic relational networks|
|**Social Reasoning**|Modeling stakeholder responses (investors, customers)|Multi-agent simulations and game-theoretic probabilistic models|

## Applied Framework: SAFE Investment Decision Example

|Framework Component|Function|Probabilistic Programming Implementation|
|---|---|---|
|**Estimate Model (Theorizing)**|Forms beliefs about valuation and growth|Bayesian regression models predicting valuation trajectories|
|**Motion Model (Productizing)**|Executes capitalization strategy|Decision trees with stochastic outcomes for funding scenarios|
|**Sensor Model (Evaluating)**|Gathers and processes market feedback|Bayesian filtering of noisy market signals to extract actionable insights|
|**Unified Model**|Integrates all components for improved decision-making|Probabilistic program combining all three models with feedback loops|
