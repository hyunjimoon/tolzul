Social reasoning involves reasoning about the minds of other intelligent agents, such as how their goals, preferences, and circumstances shape their actions as they navigate in the world. 

# Social Reasoning in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

## Definition and Key Concepts

Social reasoning involves modeling how different stakeholders think, behave, and respond to actions. It enables entrepreneurs to predict how various actors in their ecosystem will react to decisions and to understand the mental models of customers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders.

Key components include:

- **Theory of Mind**: Understanding that others have distinct beliefs, desires, and intentions
- **Stakeholder Modeling**: Representing different groups' preferences and decision criteria
- **Recursive Thinking**: Considering what others think you think
- **Social Utility Functions**: Modeling how different groups value outcomes differently

## Examples from Angie Moon's Presentation

### Modeling Multiple Stakeholders

Angie Moon explicitly addresses the need to model various stakeholders in entrepreneurial decision-making:

"For practitioners, I think it's mostly predict the others behaviors. And when I say others, there are a lot of agents in the environment. For instance, the co-founder, how to align decision making with the other person... and customers... and investors... and competing entrants."

She highlights specific examples of how social reasoning applies to different stakeholders:

1. **Co-founders**: "The co-founder, how to align decision making with the other person I know. We don't share the exact same prior and we should also allocate the resource."
    
2. **Customers**: "For instance, iPad, it was new product for the customers as well. So how can we model the utility for the customers?"
    
3. **Investors**: "For investors, effective visual communication and raising the fund."
    
4. **Competitors**: "For instance, Tesla and better place entered the same similar market, and somehow anticipating the other opponents matters."
    

### Recursive Modeling Structure

Angie discusses the recursive nature of social reasoning when responding to a comment from Raul:

"Regarding Ralph's comments, this would be a second topic for two weeks after session and reasoning about other agents. The reason why I resonate with your confusion, but I was confused as well, but I think statistical analysis or building some hierarchical modeling to model other roles is part of the reasoning. So there is some recursive structure... The mental model here that I am modeling, maybe my model, but at the same time the other person's model."

This highlights how entrepreneurs must not only create models of others but understand that these "others" are themselves creating models, creating a recursive structure of beliefs about beliefs.

### Heterogeneous Priors and Experimental Design

Scott Stern contributes an insight about social reasoning in the context of experiments:

"Once you allow for heterogeneous priors, then there's going to be a demand. Then, without heterogeneous priors, it makes no sense to run biased experiments... the experiment I do to convince the skeptic is different than the experiment I do to dissuade myself."

This illustrates how entrepreneurs must reason about different stakeholders' prior beliefs when designing experiments or pitches. The evidence that would convince a skeptical investor might be different from what would convince a customer or even the entrepreneur themselves.

## Application in Entrepreneurial Decision Making

Social reasoning helps entrepreneurs to:

1. **Design Persuasive Communications**: Tailor messages to different stakeholders based on their beliefs and values
    
2. **Anticipate Reactions**: Predict how customers, investors, or competitors will respond to new products or strategies
    
3. **Build Effective Teams**: Understand co-founders' and employees' mental models to create alignment
    
4. **Navigate Negotiations**: Model counterparties' thinking to find mutually beneficial arrangements
    
5. **Design Better Experiments**: Create tests that will be convincing to key stakeholders, not just to the entrepreneur
    

For entrepreneurs, social reasoning is essential because entrepreneurship is fundamentally social - it involves creating value through new configurations of relationships among various stakeholders in a market ecosystem.
