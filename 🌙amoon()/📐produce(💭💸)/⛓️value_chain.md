**THEORETICAL VERSION:**
My dissertation characterizes entrepreneurial decision making by separating it with conventional decision setting for optimal stopping, also known as secretary problem. While secretaries are chosen from fixed candidate pools with clear thresholds, entrepreneurs navigate constantly evolving option sets and action spaces. I prove why this variable state-action space invalidates traditional frameworks and propose a path from **BMJ|DE** (where belief, meaning, and judging functions operate under fixed desire and environment) to **BMJDE** (where entrepreneurial cognition fully integrates with market-level uncertainty). This transformation represents a new theory of entrepreneurial choice that bridges individual decision-making with collective market intelligence. [[üåì‚å®Ô∏èEntrepreneurs Are Not Secretaries_Decision Making when State and Action are Indistinguishable]]

To achieve this integration, I first tackle the founder-investor alignment problem, moving from **BMJ|DE** to **BMJD|E** by incorporating desire while keeping environment modular. Using investor archetype analysis, I demonstrate how heterogeneous investors vary in both meaning construction (how they interpret signals) and judging preferences (what they value). This foundational step reveals how rational meaning construction emerges between founders and investors through Bayesian calibration. [[üåíüìêTest quantities shape sensitivity]]

The final transformation from **BMJD|E** to **BMJDE** introduces environment integration, where individual entrepreneurial decisions harmonize with societal-level uncertainty dynamics. The theory shows how entrepreneurs can align their cognitive processes with market-level epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty ratios, achieving true Bayesian calibrated choice. This sequential approach - first establishing rational meaning construction, then extending to market-level integration - provides a complete theoretical framework for entrepreneurial decision-making. [[üåîüåäBayesian Calibrated Choice_Balancing Individual and Market-Level Uncertainty]]

**ALGORITHMIC VERSION:**
My dissertation formalizes entrepreneurial decision-making through a variable state-action framework where both S (state space) and A (action space) are non-stationary. I prove that when dim(S) and dim(A) vary over time t, standard optimal stopping conditions ‚àÉœÑ* : E[V(œÑ*)] ‚â• E[V(œÑ)] ‚àÄœÑ no longer hold. This motivates a transformation from **BMJ|DE**, where {Belief,Meaning,Judging} are variable functions over fixed {Desire,Environment}, to **BMJDE**, where all functions achieve Bayesian self-consistency.

The first transformation from **BMJ|DE** to **BMJD|E** implements Bayesian calibration through p(action|state) and p(state|observation) modeling. Using synthetic investor generation and hierarchical logit analysis, I model the joint distribution p(meaning, judging|investor_type). This allows quantification of how meaning construction p(s|o) and judging functions p(a|s) vary across investor archetypes, enabling systematic analysis of rational meaning construction.

The final transformation to **BMJDE** implements simulation-based calibration checking for Bayesian computation, verifying when individual cognitive architectures achieve consistency with market-level uncertainty. The implementation uses program synthesis to model the complete integration, with Bayesian self-consistency equations œÄprior(Œ∏) = ‚à´dy‚à´dŒ∏ÃÉ œÄpost(Œ∏|y)œÄobs(y|Œ∏ÃÉ)œÄprior(Œ∏ÃÉ) verifying alignment between individual and market-level distributions.

Starting from **BMJ|DE**, where entrepreneurs operate with variable belief, meaning, and judging functions under fixed desire and environment, I envision a path to **BMJDE** - a state where individual entrepreneurial cognition fully integrates with societal-level uncertainty dynamics. This transformation from modular to integrated decision-making represents a fundamental reconceptualization of entrepreneurship, moving beyond simple optimal stopping rules to a rich framework where individual and collective knowledge harmonize.

The progression to **BMJD|E** shows how we first integrate desire while keeping environment modular. This represents entrepreneurs learning to align their belief, meaning, and judging functions with investors through Bayesian calibration. At this stage, founders can navigate through either judging (targeting aligned investors) or meaning (shifting signal interpretation) paths, but crucially maintain separation from broader market dynamics (environment remains modular).

Finally, reaching **BMJDE** means achieving complete integration across all dimensions - belief, meaning, judging, desire, and environment work in concert. This state represents true Bayesian calibrated choice, where entrepreneurial decisions naturally align with societal-level uncertainty ratios. The entrepreneur's cognitive architecture becomes fully synchronized with market-level epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, creating a harmonious system of individual and collective knowledge.

How's this revision? The enhanced understanding of states really helps clarify both the journey and the destination!
