_(Our guiding philosophy)_ – We use a **Bayesian entrepreneurship** approach to navigate the uncertain world of mobility innovation. In essence, this means we acknowledge that every team member and stakeholder comes in with their own **prior beliefs** about what will work (shaped by experience, intuition, and desire). Instead of ignoring those subjective beliefs, we make them explicit and then systematically update them through experiments. In the mobility sector – where the landscape ranges from micromobility solutions (e.g. e-scooters) to moonshot ideas like autonomous vehicles – our prior beliefs heavily influence which niche we pursue and how we operate. A key insight is that **beliefs drive collaboration patterns**: for example, a founder who firmly believes in autonomous transit will seek out like-minded partners and investors, whereas one skeptical of that might focus on more immediate solutions like improved biking infrastructure. We’ve seen this in our journey: our vision for sustainable, connected transit has attracted mentors and investors who share an optimistic outlook on city innovation.

Using Bayesian logic, we treat every action (from customer interviews to pilot launches) as an experiment that yields new information. **Optimists** on our team frame experiments to confirm big opportunities, while **skeptics** frame them to test for flaws – we consciously incorporate both views (see [[Optimism vs Skepticism]]). For instance, an optimist-driven test might aim to prove demand exists in a new neighborhood, whereas a skeptic-driven test might ensure a new feature doesn’t introduce safety issues. Either way, each result is data that we feed back into our belief system. _If an experiment succeeds_, we update our confidence upward; _if it fails_, we adjust or pivot. By continuously updating our roadmap based on evidence, we gradually reduce uncertainty. This helps us distinguish between **random market noise** (things we simply cannot predict yet) and **knowledge gaps we can fill**. Over time, Bayesian entrepreneurship lets us and our ecosystem partners figure out which unknowns are just inherent risks to accept versus which unknowns we can systematically chip away at through learning.

In practical terms, this approach has several benefits in the mobility ecosystem: 
(1) It improves interpretation of experimental results – e.g. if a microtransit pilot underperforms, we analyze whether it was due to randomness (bad weather that week) or a correctable issue (pricing too high), rather than jumping to conclusions. 
(2) It helps us anticipate collaborator behavior – knowing each stakeholder’s priors, we can predict how a city official or a corporate partner might react to a given proposal, and tailor our evidence accordingly. 
(3) It guides joint venture design – we can structure partnerships where each party contributes to experiments aligned with their beliefs (for instance, a transit agency might test regulatory aspects while we test tech feasibility, each updating our own models). 
(4) It ultimately **builds a stronger innovation network**: by being transparent about our hypotheses and results, we foster trust with partners, leading to more support and sharing of data. 
All of this accelerates the development of sustainable transportation solutions, which is our end goal. In summary, _Bayesian entrepreneurship in mobility_ means **starting with subjective convictions but committing to evolving them rationally** – it’s an iterative dance of vision and evidence. This philosophy underpins everything we do, from high-level strategy to daily operations.
