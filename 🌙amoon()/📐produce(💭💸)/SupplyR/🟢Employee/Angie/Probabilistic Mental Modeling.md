_(Core Technology 5 of 5 – Learned from 9.66 Computational Cognitive Science)_

At the heart of our decision-making is an effort to model our own understanding of the opportunity – essentially, to build and refine a **mental model of our venture’s landscape**. What we gained from computational cognitive science is the ability to do this modeling in a formal, probabilistic way. In practical terms, we have started using **probabilistic programming and AI language model techniques** to represent the complex web of factors in our business and how we believe they relate. This is like creating a simulation of our startup in code, fueled by data, which we can update as we learn.
 
For instance, consider all the assumptions we have about our mobility service: “commuters value low wait times,” “drivers care more about earnings than flexibility,” “city X is likely to approve autonomous vehicle pilots,” etc. Each of these can be seen as a variable or rule in a model. Using probabilistic programming tools (such as PyMC or Stan), we encode these beliefs and assign them probability distributions reflecting our uncertainty. As we gather evidence (through experiments, surveys, external data), we update these distributions. The outcome is a continuously evolving **belief network** about our venture’s environment. This helps in two ways:

1. It makes our **implicit assumptions explicit** – we actually write them down and quantify our uncertainty.
    
2. It allows computational inference – the model can simulate scenarios or answer “what if” questions by drawing on the probabilities.
    
In essence, we’re augmenting our human intuition with a computational **Bayesian brain**. It’s a form of rational meaning-making: rather than gut feelings alone, we have a structured model to interpret results. If, say, our pilot yields a surprising result (e.g., low weekend usage), we can see which part of the model might explain it (maybe our assumption about weekend travel demand was too high) and adjust accordingly. Over time, this probabilistic mental model becomes more accurate, encoding the lessons of hundreds of tests and experiences. It’s like an evolving map of our opportunity space, highlighting where we’re confident and where big uncertainties remain.
  
Interestingly, this highly analytical approach has managed to **win over even our initially skeptical partners**. [[Vikash]], who always pushed for rationality, appreciated that we have a rigorous tool to justify our decisions – it’s not just “the founders’ hunch,” but a model-backed projection. [[Jinhua]], with his technical background, is excited by our use of cutting-edge tools and sees it as a way to potentially inform urban policy as well (e.g., if our model suggests a certain factor is key to adoption, he can consider that in his work). This core technology exemplifies bridging theory and practice: we literally apply computational cognitive science to entrepreneurship.
 
To implement this, we built what we call our **Bayesian dashboard**. It’s an internal tool where we input new data and it updates key metrics/probabilities (like “probability our monthly active users will exceed X by year-end” or “likelihood that a city with certain characteristics approves our proposal”). It doesn’t give absolute answers, but it provides a rational baseline that informs our strategy discussions. When debates arise (optimism vs skepticism moments), referring to the model helps ground everyone: “According to our current model, there’s a 30% chance this market is too price-sensitive – do we have evidence to change that?” It’s not that the model dictates decisions, but it _constructs a shared, rational reference_ for decision-making.
 
This approach to modeling is essentially our way of performing **rational meaning construction** at scale and with complexity. Entrepreneurs always build mental models; we’re just doing it explicitly and quantitatively. It helps guard against biases by forcing us to confront numbers. And as our startup grows, this model can also be a training tool – new team members can explore it to understand why we believe what we do. Ultimately, probabilistic mental modeling keeps us honest and sharp: every belief is one we’re willing to bet on, update, or discard based on evidence. It’s the embodiment of being _data-informed but belief-driven_, striking a balance between vision and validation.
