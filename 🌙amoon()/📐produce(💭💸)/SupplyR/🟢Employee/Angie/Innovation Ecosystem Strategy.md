Our approach to strategy is deeply influenced by viewing the venture as part of an **innovation ecosystem**. We understand that our success doesn’t happen in isolation; it depends on a dynamic system of other ideas, companies, people, and policies. In economic terms, the **flow of new ideas** (innovations) in the mobility sector depends on the existing _stock of ideas_ (what’s already been tried or built) plus inputs like talent, capital, institutional support, and policy environment. This perspective taught us that we must pay attention to and actively engage with our broader environment, not just our internal project.

In practice, adopting an ecosystem mindset means several things: We identify key stakeholders (city transit authorities, other mobility startups, academia, commuters’ advocacy groups) and consider them in our decision-making. For instance, when designing an experiment around ride-sharing, we also consider how taxi unions or public transit might react or participate. Our strategy involves **collaboration and adaptation** – we might partner with a bike-share company rather than build our own, if it accelerates learning and market penetration. We’re open to data-sharing agreements because an ecosystem thrives on knowledge flow. Importantly, we realize that our **sampling strategies (experiments) have to adapt to the ecosystem context**. If the whole industry is rapidly iterating a certain technology (e.g., electric scooters), we should shorten our cycle to not fall behind and maybe focus on a complementary niche. If, conversely, the space is greenfield and nobody has tried a concept, we might take more time to thoroughly test all aspects since external information is scarce.

[[Scott]] was a big proponent of this ecosystem view – he regularly asks how our actions align with trends and players in the mobility space. His optimism about synergy pushed us to, for example, join a consortium on urban mobility data early on. That move wasn’t an immediate customer win, but it positioned us in a network where we learned vicariously from others’ experiments (and they from ours). A concrete tactic from this strategy: **adaptive sampling in context**. When we expanded a pilot, we chose a city where an autonomous shuttle program was already running. Why? Because the presence of that program meant citizens and regulators there had some familiarity with new mobility tech – the ecosystem was “warmer” and our experiments could piggyback on that openness. In contrast, in a city with no such context, we’d face colder start and possibly misinterpret lukewarm results as lack of demand when it might be lack of awareness.

By fundamentally altering our view of entrepreneurial decision-making to include ecosystem dynamics, we design experiments that capture external feedback loops. Another example: regulatory feedback is part of our experiment outcomes. A test isn’t just if users like product X, but also how the city council responds to product X’s concept. We’ve built flexibility to pivot not just on user feedback but on any ecosystem signal (like a new law or a competitor’s failure teaching us something). **In summary, our ecosystem strategy means we learn and evolve in tandem with the world around us.** It’s made our venture more resilient and better integrated. And when we present our progress to investors or partners, we emphasize this: we’re not just building a product, we’re cultivating a network of allies and adapting to a moving landscape. That message, born from this core concept, has fundamentally set us apart in how we plan and execute our business.
