 
## **1. Step-by-Step Mapping of DE Steps to STRAP Components**

  
The table below maps each of the 24 Disciplined Entrepreneurship (DE) steps from Bill Aulet’s framework to the corresponding element of Angie’s **STRAP** framework – categorized into **Perception**, **Action**, or **Confirmation** phases. Each DE step’s focus is summarized, and its alignment or divergence with STRAP is noted, including specific STRAP models or decision rules where applicable:

|**DE Step (Aulet)**|**Focus of DE Step**|**Corresponding STRAP Component** **_(Perception, Action, Confirmation)_** **–** **_Mapping & Notes_**|
|---|---|---|
|**Step 1: Market Segmentation**|Identify a range of potential customer segments; narrow down to 6–12 promising options . The goal is to focus on _who_ the customer could be.|**Perception** – STRAP begins by modeling the opportunity space and stakeholders’ beliefs. Market segmentation corresponds to building _initial belief distributions_ over different market segments or stakeholder groups. Rather than brainstorming arbitrarily, STRAP would frame this as mapping prior probabilities to each segment’s potential, effectively weighting segments by their _success likelihood_ and relevance. The **Optimization Approach** in STRAP’s perception phase involves “value-weighted success likelihood optimization” – analogous to evaluating which segment offers the best chance of venture success (e.g. where customer need, size, and accessibility make stakeholder buy-in most likely). In short, both frameworks stress starting broad then focusing, but STRAP formalizes it by assigning probabilistic weights to segments and selecting an initial target based on maximizing expected value.|
|**Step 2: Select a Beachhead Market**|From the segments, pick one _beachhead_ market to focus on first . Criteria include customer accessibility, lack of competition, and alignment with founders’ goals . Narrow further to a specific segment with similar customers and inter-customer communication (“word of mouth”) .|**Perception** – This is a strategic _decision_ point that STRAP handles through its perception/optimization blend. In STRAP, selecting a beachhead equates to choosing the stakeholder segment that yields the highest _information value per resource spent_. The framework’s **Optimization Approach** at the _Nature level_ seeks to maximize “value-weighted success likelihood”, which mirrors Aulet’s qualitative criteria with a quantitative twist. STRAP would evaluate which potential market, if pursued, most increases the probability of overall venture success per unit effort (considering factors like segment size, ease of reach, and impact on other stakeholders). This corresponds to Aulet’s advice to be disciplined and focus on one segment, but STRAP provides a decision rule: pick the segment that optimizes the venture’s chance of confirmation given limited resources. In essence, Aulet’s beachhead selection is echoed in STRAP as a constrained optimization problem – **Perception** modeling identifies the best initial “bay” to attack given prior beliefs and uncertainty.|
|**Step 3: Build an End User Profile**|Define a detailed profile of the typical end user in the beachhead market . Understand their demographics, needs, and context. Distinguish the end user from the purchaser if different, and identify roles in the decision-making unit (champion, economic buyer, influencers) . Primary market research (interviews, observation) is emphasized .|**Perception** – This step deepens understanding of the chosen customer segment, aligning with STRAP’s _Perception_ phase where the entrepreneur constructs **mental models of stakeholders**. In STRAP, _stakeholder-level inference_ involves “mapping [each] stakeholder’s decision space” – effectively profiling what each key player (e.g. end user, economic buyer) cares about, their pain points and criteria. Aulet’s end-user profile and DMU roles correspond to defining the initial parameters of each stakeholder’s belief model in STRAP’s perception component. The STRAP framework would treat the end user’s preferences, needs, and uncertainties as variables in a Bayesian belief model. The act of interviewing and observing customers is seen as gathering prior data to calibrate these models. Thus, DE’s qualitative profiling is mirrored by STRAP’s formal stakeholder modeling: both identify who the user is and what they value, but STRAP encodes this in a structured model (with e.g. stakeholder weightings μ_j and uncertainty λ_j for each need) rather than just a narrative persona.|
|**Step 4: Calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Beachhead**|Estimate the total revenue or unit potential in the beachhead market (typically by multiplying number of potential customers by annual revenue per customer) to ensure it’s big enough . TAM gauges the scale of the opportunity in that initial target market.|**Perception** – TAM analysis is an analytical step that informs stakeholder expectations, so it falls under STRAP’s _Perception_ modeling. In STRAP, market size would be one of the **initial state parameters** influencing stakeholder belief. For example, an investor stakeholder’s prior expectation μInvestor of venture payoff would incorporate the TAM – a larger TAM raises the ceiling for revenue, moving the investor closer to commitment if other conditions are met. While DE provides a formulaic _worksheet_ approach to TAM, STRAP would treat TAM as an input to the Bayesian model of venture potential. TAM essentially appears in the _Nature-level inference_ as part of the “initial belief distributions reflecting stakeholder weights and initial state” – here, _initial state_ includes market size and demand level. If TAM is too low, STRAP’s model would show that an investor’s acceptance threshold likely cannot be met, indicating a need to pivot early. Thus, both frameworks use TAM to assess viability, but STRAP embeds it in a probabilistic model of stakeholder satisfaction (e.g. a small TAM means an investor’s required expectation **λ** cannot go to zero).|
|**Step 5: Profile the Persona for Beachhead**|Choose one archetypal _persona_ (a fictional, specific example customer) in the beachhead to focus product design and marketing. Detail this persona’s characteristics, needs, and how the product fits into their life. The persona personalizes the end user profile.|**Perception** – This extends Step 3’s end-user profiling and remains within STRAP’s perception domain. Creating a persona is essentially honing the stakeholder model to a concrete instance. In STRAP terms, this could correspond to _assigning concrete values to model parameters_ for a representative stakeholder. For example, if earlier steps identified a range of needs and behaviors, the persona pins down specific values (e.g. budget, daily routine, pain point severity) for a notional customer. STRAP’s Bayesian approach can incorporate such specific data as a prior for simulations – effectively treating the persona’s attributes as a scenario to test the product-market fit. While STRAP does not mandate a narrative persona, it would view this as useful input to calibrate the “initial belief distribution” of the customer stakeholder. Both DE and STRAP agree on the importance of focusing on a _specific_ target user. The difference is mainly in format: DE uses a story-driven persona; STRAP would absorb those details into the quantitative model of customer behavior and value perception.|
|**Step 6: Full Life Cycle Use Case**|Map out, step by step, how the customer becomes aware of your product, acquires it, uses it, and what happens after (e.g. support, repeat usage). This is the **end-to-end journey** of the customer with the product . It ensures you understand all customer touchpoints.|**Perception** – Understanding the customer’s full journey is an analytic exercise that informs _where uncertainties lie_ in the venture. In STRAP’s perception phase, this corresponds to mapping the _state transition logic_ from a customer’s perspective – essentially how a potential customer moves from unaware to aware, to trial, to adoption. STRAP’s inference models would consider each stage as part of the customer stakeholder’s decision process, with probabilities of drop-off or conversion at each step. This is closely related to what STRAP calls “experimental trajectories” planning – ensuring that planned actions (experiments or engagements) align with the customer’s natural life cycle. For instance, if a critical uncertainty is whether customers will continue use after trial, STRAP would mark that as a key node in the life cycle to test. Aulet’s use case provides a narrative for that; STRAP formalizes it by predicting how evidence at one stage (e.g. a successful pilot) updates the likelihood of proceeding to the next. In sum, the life cycle use case in DE helps identify potential _drop-off points_ and required actions, which STRAP would use to inform its sequential action planning (ensuring the model accounts for each stage’s uncertainty and the experiments needed to resolve them). It’s still **Perception** because it’s about modeling and anticipating customer behavior before taking action.|
|**Step 7: High-Level Product Specification**|Define the core features of the product and sketch out what the product will roughly look like or how it will function . The goal is to ensure the product addresses the persona’s needs from Step 5 and fits into the use case from Step 6. (It’s a conceptual design, not a detailed engineering spec.)|**Perception** – This step is about conceptual solution design, which in STRAP terms means choosing hypotheses about _what offering will satisfy the stakeholder_. It remains part of the perception phase because it involves setting assumptions that will later be tested. In the STRAP framework, the product spec would feed into the _initial stakeholder belief models_: it defines what value proposition is being promised, which in turn defines what needs to be confirmed. For example, if the spec includes a certain performance metric, stakeholders will have beliefs about whether that can be achieved. STRAP would record these as part of the prior expectations. There is also an optimization aspect: you want a product spec that is just sufficient to test the concept (in line with lean principles). STRAP implicitly encourages minimal feature sets by focusing on _experiments with maximum information value_ – a high-level spec that is tightly scoped around testing key value assumptions aligns with that principle. In short, Aulet’s high-level spec translates to STRAP as defining the venture’s value proposition hypothesis. It’s a _Perception_ activity because it sets the stage for which uncertainties (feasibility, desirability of features) will need to be resolved during Action.|
|**Step 8: Quantify the Value Proposition**|Translate the product’s benefits into quantitative metrics for the customer (e.g. “saves 5 hours a week” or “reduces cost by 30%”). This step ensures you can articulate concrete value to the customer .|**Perception** – Quantifying value is an analytic step closely related to modeling customer utility. In STRAP’s perception component, this corresponds to assigning numeric values to the benefits in the customer’s mental model. A customer stakeholder’s belief μCustomer about the product will depend on the size of the benefit relative to cost – by quantifying it, the entrepreneur refines that stakeholder’s expected value calculation. STRAP’s Bayesian model would take these values as inputs (for example, prior distributions over “time saved” or “money saved” by the product). Both frameworks agree on grounding the value in data: DE frames it as a selling point to test with customers, while STRAP uses it to predict how much an action (like a demo) should shift customer belief. Additionally, this step in DE sets up metrics for later confirmation (Step 23, “the dogs eat the dog food”, will check if customers indeed realize this value). STRAP would incorporate those same metrics into the Confirmation criteria for the customer: e.g. **Confirmation** for a customer might require seeing that 5 hours/week are actually saved in a pilot. Thus, Step 8’s output becomes a quantitative hypothesis that STRAP will seek to validate through experiments. It’s part of **Perception** since it refines the model of what needs to be proven.|
|**Step 9: Identify Your Next 10 Customers**|List the next 10 real target customers (by name or specific entity) after your initial one. This validates that the beachhead market has breadth and that your persona isn’t an outlier . It also starts early business development outreach.|**Perception** – This step is still about market understanding, essentially stress-testing the chosen segment for replicability. In STRAP terms, it’s an extension of the market model: instead of one theoretical customer, confirm there are many similar customers. By identifying actual prospects, the entrepreneur gains more data for the _initial belief_ about demand. For example, if you can only find 3 potential customers instead of 10, that lowers the prior probability of scaling success. STRAP would treat outreach to these next 10 customers as _preliminary probes_ – possibly small actions (like conversations) that inform the perception model without yet being major experiments. These probes help refine the distribution of customer willingness-to-buy. Notably, listing next 10 customers in DE could blur into action (if you actually contact them, you’re engaging in market research experimentation). However, within Aulet’s structure it’s mostly a planning exercise. So we map it to **Perception**: it enhances the entrepreneur’s perception of market breadth. STRAP’s models would incorporate evidence from any early discussions with those customers to update stakeholder belief consistency (if all next 10 express a similar need, the entrepreneur gains confidence in the persona’s generality). In essence, both frameworks use this to ensure the initial target market is _not just one customer_. STRAP formalizes the benefit: more identified customers reduces uncertainty in demand, lowering overall stakeholder uncertainty penalties λ .|
|**Step 10: **Validate Your “Core”**|Determine and prove what is uniquely enabling your solution – the “core” (e.g. a technology, network effect, specific expertise) that gives you a durable advantage . You may run a demonstration or gather evidence to show your core actually works and is defensible.|**Action** – This is one of the first DE steps that explicitly calls for _testing_ a critical hypothesis. “Validating your core” often means building a prototype or running an experiment to show that the key innovation or advantage is real. In STRAP, this corresponds to taking an **Action** aimed at reducing a fundamental uncertainty. If the venture’s core is unproven, that represents a major uncertainty for stakeholders (customers might doubt the product can deliver, investors doubt it can’t be copied). STRAP would likely flag this as a _bottleneck experiment_: the framework’s “bottleneck-driven sequencing” logic says to tackle the biggest sources of uncertainty first . Validating the core is exactly such a source. STRAP’s **Optimization Approach** at the venture level focuses on “optimizing evidence acquisition within resource constraints” – meaning the entrepreneur should choose an action here that yields high information value about the core at reasonable cost. Aulet’s guidance to validate core aligns well: e.g. build a quick technical prototype or proof-of-concept. STRAP would evaluate that action’s impact on stakeholders’ belief: a successful prototype test would significantly boost the customer’s and investor’s expectations μ_j and reduce their uncertainty λ_j. Thus, Step 10 maps to **Action** in STRAP, as it involves executing an experiment to gather evidence. Both frameworks agree on the need to _empirically de-risk_ the unique element of the business early. STRAP adds formal backing: it would identify this as a priority experiment because it maximizes the likelihood of future stakeholder commitment (failing to validate the core would likely doom the venture, so it’s tackled head-on).|
|**Step 11: Chart Your Competitive Position**|Visually map how your product compares to alternatives on key buying criteria (often done with a 2×2 or radar chart). This clarifies your differentiation and what segments of the market those differences appeal to .|**Perception** – Charting competitive position is an analytical exercise to understand the external landscape. In STRAP, competitive analysis would be part of the initial **Perception modeling** as well. While STRAP’s focus is on stakeholders, competition influences those stakeholders’ beliefs. For instance, if competitors have failed in the past or have certain strengths, customers and investors will incorporate that into their priors. So, in STRAP the entrepreneur would encode competitive factors as exogenous parameters affecting the _likelihood of success_. Aulet’s chart helps entrepreneurs identify their advantages and weaknesses; STRAP would use that to adjust the expected value calculations. For example, if on a chart the venture is clearly superior on a key feature, STRAP’s model might assume a higher probability that customers will adopt (all else equal). Conversely, if competition is strong in an area, STRAP would reflect that as a higher threshold to convince stakeholders (perhaps a competitor’s presence raises an investor’s required proof). Though STRAP doesn’t produce a simple visual matrix, it inherently considers competition in the _stakeholder decision spaces_. This step remains **Perception** because it is about gathering and structuring knowledge. It doesn’t involve a direct experiment, but it sharpens the entrepreneur’s understanding of how hard it will be to convince stakeholders given the competitive context. Both frameworks stress not operating in a vacuum – know who else is in the game – but DE gives a concrete charting tool, whereas STRAP would absorb competitive insights into the quantitative model (for example, updating the probability of customer adoption if a known competitor exists).|
|**Step 12: Determine the Decision-Making Unit (DMU)**|Identify all the players who influence the purchasing decision for your product in the target customer organization: the end user, the champion who drives adoption, the primary economic buyer (who signs off on budget), and other influencers or gatekeepers (e.g. IT department, boss, etc.) .|**Perception** – This step expands the focus beyond the end user to a _network of stakeholders within the customer_. In STRAP, this is directly parallel to mapping out stakeholders and their interrelations, albeit DE’s DMU is confined to one customer entity. STRAP’s framework inherently is multi-stakeholder: it considers _all_ stakeholders relevant to venture success, including customers (often multiple roles), investors, partners, regulators, etc. So DE’s DMU identification is a subset of STRAP’s stakeholder mapping. Specifically, it falls under **stakeholder-level inference**: “mental model mapping to understand stakeholder decision spaces”. Each role in the DMU can be thought of as a stakeholder with its own decision criteria. STRAP would have each of those roles represented in the perception model (or aggregated appropriately). The DMU concept ensures the entrepreneur perceives the _internal_ stakeholder dynamics of a sale. STRAP’s contribution would be to formalize how those multiple influences aggregate into an outcome (e.g. the _champion_ might increase the economic buyer’s probability of saying yes by providing internal evidence). Aulet’s approach here is qualitative – list the roles and consider their needs – whereas STRAP would treat each as an agent in a Bayesian network, updating their beliefs as they observe each other’s signals. Nonetheless, it’s a **Perception** step in both: understanding who must be convinced. DE emphasizes not to overlook any influencers; STRAP’s mathematical approach ensures none are ignored by requiring _all key λ_j (for each stakeholder j)_ to go to zero for Confirmation.|
|**Step 13: Map the Process to Acquire a Paying Customer**|Lay out the **journey to sale**: how you will move a prospect through each stage of the sales funnel until they actually pay. This includes marketing touchpoints, sales calls, evaluation periods, procurement, etc., and identifies any points where the process could stall . Essentially, it’s the step-by-step of your sales cycle.|**Perception**, with a note on **Confirmation** – This is another analytical planning step that closely ties to stakeholder coordination. In DE, mapping the sales process is linear: it assumes you engage the customer in stages. From STRAP’s perspective, this is mapping a subset of the stakeholder state transitions – specifically the customer’s path to commitment. It remains **Perception** because you’re hypothesizing the process rather than executing it. However, STRAP offers a critical divergent insight here: whereas DE’s process mapping tends to be sequential (e.g. first get champion buy-in, then economic buyer sign-off, etc.), **STRAP highlights that stakeholders’ decisions can be interdependent and may need to be synchronized rather than purely sequential**. For example, STRAP notes “entrepreneurs face circular dependencies where stakeholders make simultaneous, interdependent decisions… Conventional methods tackle stakeholders sequentially, but this cannot resolve inherent circularity”. In a complex sale, the champion might say “yes” only if they sense the economic buyer is inclined to approve, and vice versa – a mini deadlock. STRAP’s approach to the sales process would be to look for opportunities to _break these deadlocks via parallel engagement strategies_. A concrete mapping under STRAP might involve orchestrating joint meetings or demos so that all DMU members get convinced together (removing the “wait for someone else” problem). Aulet’s mapping focuses on understanding the steps; STRAP agrees but adds an optimization layer: ensure the process design maximizes the probability of collective buy-in. Thus, Step 13 in STRAP is not just a static map but a plan for coordinated confirmation – a bridge from _Perception_ to the eventual _Confirmation_. (We still classify it as Perception here, since it’s a plan, but it foreshadows STRAP’s Confirmation logic by emphasizing aligned action when closing the sale.)|
|**Step 14: Calculate the TAM for Follow-on Markets**|Estimate the potential in markets you would expand to after dominating the beachhead. This demonstrates long-term upside beyond the initial segment. It’s essentially repeating TAM analysis (Step 4) for secondary markets and summing them up . This step is about showing scalability – that the venture can grow big enough.|**Perception**, edging toward **Confirmation** – Follow-on TAM is a forward-looking analysis that primarily matters to _investors_ (and founders’ strategic vision). In DE it’s a planning exercise to confirm the venture’s ultimate market can be large. In STRAP, this data would factor into the **investor stakeholder’s model** and the overall _Confirmation conditions_. For instance, an investor’s acceptance criterion might require that the total addressable market (primary + follow-ons) supports a certain return (if follow-on TAM is small, even a beachhead win might not satisfy the investor’s threshold). So, STRAP would include follow-on TAM in the perception model as part of the venture’s _future potential_. Initially, it’s part of **Perception** – you are still gathering information and assumptions about future markets. However, its real effect shows up in **Confirmation**: achieving stakeholder commitment. STRAP formalizes the idea that “all stakeholders’ acceptance criteria must be met simultaneously”, and an investor’s criteria often include market size. Thus, while DE treats Step 14 as a sanity check and for later planning, STRAP bakes it into the question “Can we get everyone on board?” If follow-on TAM is inadequate, the investor’s λInvestor will never drop to zero, preventing joint Confirmation. Both frameworks underscore the importance of long-term vision at this stage of planning, but STRAP uses it directly in a _go/no-go calculation_ for venture viability. For mapping purposes, we keep it in **Perception** (it’s analysis), noting its role in eventual confirmation.|
|**Step 15: Design a Business Model**|Define how you will deliver value to the customer and make money. This includes choosing your revenue model (e.g. one-time sale, subscription, etc.), outlining key operational components (production, distribution), and ensuring the model fits the market.|**Perception** – Crafting the business model is a strategic design step, analogous to completing pieces of a puzzle in the STRAP perception stage. Aulet’s method here often involves using the Business Model Canvas or similar tools to ensure you’ve considered all elements (value, channels, partners, costs, revenue). STRAP does not have a distinct “business model canvas” step; instead, these choices are embedded in the stakeholder model structure. For example, if the business model relies on a key partner for distribution, that partner becomes a stakeholder with its own acceptance criteria; if it’s a subscription model, that impacts customer lifetime value and investor revenue projections (thus affecting their beliefs). STRAP’s framework would incorporate the business model in both inference and optimization: the **Nature-level optimization** might consider which model yields higher success likelihood (e.g. a SaaS subscription might yield more predictable growth, affecting investor confidence, versus a one-off sales model). However, STRAP does not provide a list of model archetypes; it assumes the entrepreneur will propose one. The entrepreneur’s selection here is an input to STRAP’s calculations of expected outcomes. So, designing the business model remains a **Perception** activity – it’s deciding on assumptions and structure. Where DE offers heuristic guidance (make sure the model is scalable, etc.), STRAP would later test whether the chosen model can satisfy all stakeholders. For instance, if a certain model implies a long payback period, STRAP’s calculations might show the investor’s risk is too high unless mitigated. Thus, the business model design in DE sets parameters that STRAP uses to determine if there exists a path to Confirmation (all stakeholders happy).|
|**Step 16: Set Your Pricing Framework**|Develop a strategy for how you will price the product. This may involve understanding customer willingness to pay, competitive pricing, and whether you use value-based pricing, cost-plus, etc. The output is usually a pricing model or tiered structure, though not final price points yet .|**Perception** – Pricing is a decision to be made based on analysis and is tightly coupled with the value proposition (Step 8). In STRAP, price is a crucial assumption in the perception model: it directly affects the customer’s utility and the venture’s economics. Setting a pricing framework would be part of the **stakeholder decision-space mapping** – essentially defining what price level would keep the customer’s expected value positive and also satisfy the investor’s required margins. STRAP might approach this as an optimization problem: **Stakeholder-level optimization** includes “maximizing convincing power per resource unit”, which in context could mean choosing a price that maximizes the chance of customer purchase relative to lost profit. It’s a balance – a lower price convinces customers more easily (raising P(customer says yes)) but could harm investor returns; a higher price does the opposite. STRAP’s formalism would allow exploring this trade-off, possibly by calculating how different price points change the probability of all stakeholders reaching Confirmation. Aulet’s DE framework encourages entrepreneurs to think in terms of pricing _strategy_ (e.g. penetration vs. skim pricing). STRAP would fold those strategies into the model and predict stakeholder reactions. Still, before any actual selling, this is a **Perception** phase activity: you are hypothesizing a price strategy and might even gather initial feedback (informal customer reactions) to update your belief. In summary, DE’s pricing step is mapping out one’s approach to capture value, and STRAP treats that as setting a key parameter that will later be tested during Action (e.g., you might experiment with pricing in a trial sale) and ultimately verified at Confirmation (customers must accept the price and investors accept the margins).|
|**Step 17: Calculate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of an Acquired Customer**|Compute how much revenue (or gross profit) one customer is expected to generate over their lifetime as a customer. This involves assumptions about repeat purchases or subscription duration, customer retention rates, upsells, etc. It is a key metric to ensure each customer is sufficiently valuable to justify acquisition costs .|**Perception** – LTV is another analytical metric that informs viability. In DE, it’s used in conjunction with Step 19 (COCA) to check unit economics. In STRAP, LTV would be one output of the _venture’s performance model_ that feeds stakeholder satisfaction. For instance, an investor’s acceptance criterion may implicitly require LTV > COCA (or a certain ratio) for the business to be profitable; similarly, a partner might care about LTV if, say, they share recurring revenues. Calculating LTV in STRAP’s context means integrating various assumptions (retention rates, revenue per period) into the model’s prediction of long-term cash flow per customer. It stays in **Perception** because it’s a derived figure from the entrepreneur’s current assumptions. However, STRAP brings a probabilistic view: instead of a single number, one could have a distribution for LTV based on uncertainty in retention or usage. STRAP’s Bayesian approach would update that distribution as evidence comes in (for example, if early users stick around for 6 months, you update the expected retention). Aulet’s approach yields a point estimate or range for LTV; STRAP would incorporate that as a prior in its simulations. Both frameworks treat LTV as “homework” to be done before heavy scaling – a check that the business can eventually make money per customer. And both highlight that this is _not_ yet action, just calculation. In STRAP, if this calculation looked unfavorable (say LTV appears too low), that would raise a red flag in the perception stage – requiring either model adjustments (different pricing, product changes to improve retention) or additional actions to validate and potentially improve LTV before stakeholders would be convinced.|
|**Step 18: Map the Sales Process to Acquire a Customer**|Outline the _specific sales strategy_ and channel through which you will reach and close customers. This includes deciding direct vs. indirect sales, online vs. offline, key funnel metrics, etc. It’s essentially the go-to-market plan for sales, often depicted as a flow from lead generation to closing, including who (sales rep, distributor, web) does what .|**Perception** – This step revisits and elaborates the earlier Step 13, but from the seller’s internal perspective. It remains a planning exercise, so we categorize it under _Perception_. In STRAP terms, the choice of sales process/channel is another structural decision that determines which stakeholders are involved. For example, if you choose an indirect channel (selling through distributors), those distributors themselves become stakeholders whose buy-in is needed. If you choose direct online sales, then perhaps your _marketing system_ is the key intermediate. STRAP would incorporate these choices by possibly adding new stakeholder nodes or changing the weight of certain factors in the success probability. The **stakeholder-level optimization** “maximizing convincing power per resource unit” can be interpreted here as choosing a sales method that yields the most conversions for the least cost – essentially what Aulet wants (an efficient sales funnel). STRAP’s framework would encourage the entrepreneur to simulate different sales process scenarios in the model to see which leads to higher likelihood of Confirmation (e.g., does hiring a direct salesforce yield faster stakeholder alignment than waiting for viral online adoption?). DE gives heuristics and general exercises for picking a sales model; STRAP would evaluate it in terms of how it impacts the _Resource Budget constraint_ and _uncertainty reduction_. Since at this stage no actual selling is happening, it’s still **Perception**. It sets up hypotheses like “We will sell via channel X” that later need Confirmation (e.g., will channel partners agree to sell our product? That might become an experiment of its own). Notably, if the chosen sales process introduces a _new critical stakeholder_ (say a major distributor), STRAP would highlight the need to include that in the Confirmation phase (all key players must say yes). Aulet’s step doesn’t explicitly frame it that way, so STRAP provides the more exhaustive perspective on stakeholder inclusion.|
|**Step 19: Calculate the Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA)**|Compute how much it costs to acquire one customer. This involves marketing and sales expenses, sales cycle length, conversion rates at each funnel stage, etc. It’s a counterpart to LTV – you want COCA to be significantly less than LTV for a viable model .|**Perception** – Like LTV, COCA is a calculated metric in the planning stage. It feeds into the venture’s economic model. In STRAP, COCA would factor into both **Action** decisions and **Confirmation** criteria. Initially, we treat it as **Perception**: the entrepreneur estimates COCA based on assumed channel strategy and known costs. This estimation is subject to uncertainty, which STRAP would capture as a distribution (since early on you don’t know exact costs—maybe you have ranges for conversion rates and ad costs). The significance of COCA in STRAP is tied to the _Resource constraints_: the framework explicitly includes a resource budget constraint (e.g. money available for customer acquisition). A high COCA means you burn resources faster to acquire each customer, raising the “resource shadow price” γ in STRAP’s model . If γ becomes too high, it indicates the venture will run out of funds before achieving Confirmation. Thus, STRAP would alert the entrepreneur if the presumed COCA is untenable relative to LTV and budget. Aulet’s DE teaches the rule-of-thumb that LTV should be > COCA (often LTV >> COCA). STRAP formalizes this as a requirement for investor and venture sustainability stakeholder satisfaction: if LTV/COCA is below a threshold, the investor’s belief in venture success won’t meet the Confirmation threshold (one can view it as investor expecting a certain ROI which LTV/COCA ratio encapsulates; indeed DE’s workbook emphasizes such ratios ). Ultimately, while computing COCA is a math exercise (Perception), verifying it empirically might occur in pilot sales during Action. But DE’s step 19 is purely analysis, so in our mapping it’s **Perception** – setting another key parameter that STRAP will use to gauge viability.|
|**Step 20: Identify Key Assumptions**|Take stock of the most crucial assumptions in your plan that must be true for the business to succeed – these could be about customer behavior, technology performance, cost projections, etc. Essentially, figure out what _must_ go right (and might not) . This step is preparatory for testing.|**Perception** – This is a transitional step between planning and experimentation, but the act of identifying assumptions is an analytical task. In STRAP’s process, this corresponds directly to recognizing which uncertainties (modeled in the perception phase) contribute the most to overall risk – in other words, which unknowns drive the variance in outcomes. STRAP provides a structured way to do this via its models: by examining stakeholder belief sensitivities or by computing information value of various unknowns. In fact, STRAP explicitly decomposes complex uncertainties and identifies _bottlenecks_ – the factors causing the greatest “drag” on the joint probability of success. This aligns with isolating key assumptions. For example, if the model shows that the largest contributor to investor skepticism (λInvestor) is the assumption about customer adoption rate, then that is a key assumption to test. Aulet’s DE step is more heuristic – making a list of assumptions and picking which are “key.” STRAP offers a quantitative lens: _Information Value Calculation by stakeholder_ is part of its Action planning, which essentially ranks assumptions by how much reducing uncertainty on them increases the chance of venture success. By the end of Step 20, both frameworks have a clear list of what to test. In mapping, this remains **Perception** because you haven’t run the tests yet – you are analyzing and prioritizing. STRAP’s unique contribution is formalizing this prioritization: it would compute, for instance, that “Assumption X accounts for 40% of the overall uncertainty in joint success probability, so tackle that first.” In summary, DE says “know your key assumptions,” STRAP says “here is how we formally identify the top uncertainties (bottlenecks) that we need to address.” Both lead to the next step of testing.|
|**Step 21: Test Key Assumptions**|Conduct experiments to validate or invalidate the critical assumptions identified in Step 20. Aulet emphasizes doing this _as cheaply and quickly as possible_, using minimally elaborate tests to get empirical data . This is essentially the Lean Startup style rapid experimentation within the DE framework.|**Action** – This step is pure **Action** in STRAP terms: running experiments and gathering evidence. It is at the heart of STRAP’s iterative learning cycle. Both DE and STRAP strongly agree on the approach: **test fast, test cheap, focus on the critical unknowns**. Aulet advises using simple empirical tests without “anything fancy” – for instance, landing page tests, interviews, prototypes – which is directly parallel to STRAP’s idea of actions as experiments. STRAP provides formal guidance on which experiments to run first through its “stakeholder-weighted experiment prioritization” optimization. It would have the entrepreneur execute the experiment that maximizes information gain about the most critical uncertainty per unit cost . For example, if the key assumption is that customers will achieve a certain outcome with the product, STRAP might suggest a quick pilot study with a small sample of users. The framework then prescribes how to **update the beliefs** based on the results: “entrepreneurs benefit from treating their actions as experiments and updating their beliefs about the venture’s viability in a Bayesian manner”. So, whereas DE leaves the mechanism of learning implicit, STRAP explicitly models it: after each test, you perform a _Bayesian update_ on each stakeholder’s inferred likelihood of success. For instance, a successful assumption test might significantly increase the investor’s confidence (lowering their λInvestor). In summary, Step 21 maps to STRAP’s **Action** phase, reinforced by rigorous decision rules: test the riskiest assumption first, gather data, update the model. Both frameworks emphasize iteration and learning here, but STRAP adds mathematical rigor to why and how to prioritize and update – essentially functioning like a “venture GPS” guiding the entrepreneur through optimal experimental steps.|
|**Step 22: Define the Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP)**|Build the simplest version of your product that customers will pay for – not just an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to test usage, but something that delivers enough value that a customer is willing to exchange money (or serious commitment) for it . The MVBP must solve the customer’s core problem in a basic way and prove the business model can work on a small scale.|**Action** – Creating and deploying the MVBP is an _action_ that tests multiple assumptions in an integrated manner. It’s essentially an experiment that includes a real transaction or usage under realistic conditions. In STRAP, this corresponds to a significant experiment often near the end of the Action phase – a pilot or trial that engages the customer stakeholder (and possibly others) in a real-world scenario. Running an MVBP trial would be guided by STRAP’s _Resource-constrained action sequence optimization_, ensuring that this step is timed when its information value is maximized and the venture can afford it. For instance, STRAP might sequence simpler tests (Step 21) before investing in an MVBP, to make sure the MVBP’s design addresses known issues. Once ready, launching the MVBP provides direct evidence on two fronts: (a) **Customer confirmation** – will they actually pay and use it? and (b) **Operational validation** – can we deliver at least minimally. In STRAP’s framework, the MVBP trial is where many stakeholder models get a major update: a paying customer is one of the strongest signals to an investor stakeholder that the business might be viable, thus drastically increasing the joint commitment probability. The MVBP aligns with STRAP’s idea of **targeting maximum learning per experiment** – it’s an experiment that not only tests product functionality but also market willingness to pay, pricing assumptions, and usage assumptions all at once. We categorize it as **Action** because it’s an executed test, but it’s a capstone action that feeds directly into Confirmation. Notably, STRAP would advise potentially coordinating this MVBP test with other stakeholders if possible (as evidenced by the Segway case lesson to invite partners/investors to witness big tests). DE doesn’t explicitly state that, but STRAP’s insight suggests that _how_ you conduct the MVBP can be optimized for greater stakeholder alignment (e.g. doing a public pilot with media, investors, and customers all watching, to generate uniform evidence for all).|
|**Step 23: Show That “The Dogs Will Eat the Dog Food”**|**Prove actual market demand.** This step means demonstrating that real customers not only _say_ they like the product, but actively use it and pay for it (the proverbial “dogs eating the dog food”). It often involves collecting metrics or testimonials from MVBP users, or even early revenue, to show that the value proposition truly resonates . Essentially, it’s product-market fit validation.|**Confirmation** – Step 23 is where DE expects you to have tangible validation that customers are on board. In STRAP, this corresponds to reaching the **Confirmation** phase for the customer stakeholder (and ideally others). STRAP formalizes this as achieving a state where the customer’s acceptance criterion is met – e.g., the customer’s posterior belief in the product’s value is strong enough that their required uncertainty threshold λCustomer → 0. However, STRAP’s Confirmation concept extends beyond just customers “eating the dog food.” It requires _simultaneous commitment of all critical stakeholders_. So while DE’s step 23 focuses on customer uptake as proof of market, STRAP’s Confirmation would additionally ask: are **other stakeholders** convinced at the same time? For example, has the successful MVBP also convinced the investor to commit funds, and the partner to sign on? STRAP explicitly frames this as a joint probability: _maximize P(all stakeholders say yes)_, which is akin to ensuring not just that dogs are eating, but that investors see it and are ready to invest, etc. In practice, STRAP would urge an entrepreneur at this stage to _synchronize the yes’s_: _“convert asynchronous progress into synchronous commitment”_ . That might mean, for instance, scheduling a demo day where customers, investors, and partners witness the “dog food eating” together. This yields a powerful confirmation event, avoiding the scenario STRAP warns about where one stakeholder backs out upon learning another was less enthusiastic (the near-miss ping-pong effect ). Aulet’s framework doesn’t explicitly mention this orchestrated confirmation, so this is a point of divergence: **DE considers customer validation sufficient evidence of traction**, whereas **STRAP insists on multi-stakeholder validation for a true Go/No-Go decision**. Nonetheless, Step 23 maps to STRAP’s **Confirmation** phase concept. The theoretical underpinning from STRAP is that once customers are genuinely using/paying (dogs eating food), and if that evidence is shared, the venture should reach a tipping point where all stakeholders gain confidence _“almost at once, resulting in a coordinated collective go-ahead.”_ In summary, DE Step 23 is a partial Confirmation (customer-only), while STRAP’s Confirmation is broader. Achieving it means you’ve transitioned from _“figuring it out” (Nail it) to “executing with everyone on board” (Scale it)_ .|
|**Step 24: Develop a Product Plan**|Formulate a detailed plan for building the fully-featured product for the beachhead market and beyond. This includes timelines, resource requirements, and milestones for product development now that the concept is validated . Essentially, it’s preparing to scale up from MVBP to a scalable offering.|**Confirmation (Post-Confirmation Execution Planning)** – Step 24 is a forward-looking planning step that comes _after_ proving the concept. In DE, this marks the transition from the iterative discovery process to formal execution: now that you know customers want it, plan how to deliver it at scale. In the STRAP framework, once the Confirmation stage is reached (all key stakeholders have said “yes, we’re in”), the venture enters what Angie’s paper calls the “Scale it” stage . Strictly speaking, STRAP’s cycle of Perception → Action → Confirmation was focused on reaching the initial _joint go-ahead_. After that point, a lot of the deepest uncertainty is resolved and the nature of decisions shifts to growth and optimization. Thus, STRAP doesn’t detail post-confirmation product planning in the same theoretical depth – it assumes that once simultaneous yes’s are achieved, the venture can move into execution mode (which is more conventional project management and less about sequential uncertainty reduction). Nonetheless, we can map Step 24 conceptually: it aligns with STRAP’s recognition that _after Confirmation, the state transitions to a stable growth trajectory_ . The **Confirmation module of STRAP formalizes** the idea that _“beyond individual yes’s, you need the simultaneous yes”_ to truly move forward. Once you have that, developing the product plan is essentially the next logical step, albeit one that falls outside STRAP’s unique analytical focus. We label it under **Confirmation** here to indicate it follows the confirmation event. In practical terms, an entrepreneur using STRAP would at this stage switch from the exploratory mode to an execution mode, guided by traditional planning. If needed, STRAP’s cycle could repeat for new uncertainties in scaling (for instance, if entering a new market, that becomes a new Perception→Action→Confirmation sub-cycle). But for the initial venture beachhead, Step 24 is **beyond the scope of the initial STRAP cycle** – it’s about leveraging the now-aligned stakeholders to build the full product and organization. Aulet’s DE provides operational tools for this (milestone setting, Gantt charts perhaps in the workbook); STRAP would simply ensure that all stakeholder conditions are satisfied so that this plan can be executed with support in place.|
