The discussion focused on predicting venture success and stakeholder commitment. Speaker 1 emphasized the importance of predicting stakeholder behavior, particularly commitment, using a prediction-based prescription model. They highlighted the subjectivity of venture success and the need for measurable metrics like stakeholder commitments. Speaker 2 discussed the challenges of accessing private data from startups and VCs, noting the variability in data quality and the difficulty in obtaining comprehensive datasets. They also mentioned the potential for quant VC funds to predict outliers and the importance of resource allocation in venture operations. The conversation concluded with plans to share research and explore future collaboration opportunities.

## Action Items

- [ ] Read and discuss one chapter of the Bayesian Entrepreneurship book each week in the Thursday meeting.
- [ ] Provide the presentation on the observation of different startup attributes and their relationship to investor perception.
- [ ] Share the Bayesian Entrepreneurship book with the group.

## Outline

- Speaker 2 asks about the understanding of union entrepreneurship and its alignment with venture success forecasting literature.
- Speaker 1 explains the goal of prediction-based prescription, focusing on predicting stakeholder behavior, especially commitment behavior.
- Speaker 1 discusses the concept of commitment stocks and the importance of balancing promises and capacity to avoid costs.

### Challenges in Measuring Venture Success

- Speaker 1 highlights the subjectivity of venture success probability and the difficulty in measuring it.
- Speaker 2 mentions the challenges of bootstrapping companies and the importance of revenue data.
- Speaker 1 emphasizes the need to decompose the problem into predicting stakeholder commitment, which is more measurable.

- Speaker 1 agrees on the lack of measurement infrastructure and the challenges in data quality.
- Speaker 2 shares their experience with using funding data and CrunchBase for venture research.
- Speaker 1 mentions the importance of empirical data to support theoretical models in venture operations.

### Theoretical Models and Empirical Data in Venture Research

- Speaker 1 discusses the need for a decision-making model to understand venture operations and successful venture operations.
- Speaker 1 expresses skepticism about some arguments in Bayesian entrepreneurship due to the difficulty in measuring entrepreneurial optimism.
- Speaker 2 suggests using personality traits as a moderator in predicting entrepreneurial behavior.
- Speaker 1 explains the complexity of measuring optimism and the impact of different opportunities on decision-making.

### Publication and Future Research Directions

- Speaker 2 expresses interest in reading Speaker 1's publication once it's out.
- Speaker 3 shares their interest in Bayesian entrepreneurship and the weekly reading sessions they have with colleagues.
- Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 discuss the possibility of joining future sessions to deepen their understanding and explore future opportunities.

### Predicting Unicorn Outliers and Quant VC Funds

- Speaker 3 asks if it will be possible to reliably predict unicorn outliers or if ML-based forecasting methods will only sort them out.
- Speaker 2 discusses the potential for true quant VC funds and the need to predict outliers rather than just failures.
- Speaker 1 explains the challenges of predicting venture success and the importance of resource allocation for investors.
- Speaker 2 shares insights on the Medallion Fund and the potential for quant VC funds to achieve similar success.

### Milestone Setting and Resource Allocation in Startups

- Speaker 2 describes the process of setting milestones and resource allocation for startups in accelerator settings.
- Speaker 1 discusses the importance of prioritizing stakeholders based on their commitment difficulty and cost.
- Speaker 2 shares their experience with coaching startups and the importance of thinking backwards from milestones.
- Speaker 1 suggests using a maximization problem approach to optimize resource allocation and predict venture success.

### Literature and Research on Entrepreneurial Decision-Making

- Speaker 2 mentions the work of Paul Gompers on venture capitalist decision-making and the behavior of venture capitalists.
- Speaker 1 discusses the tension between predicting current behavior and optimizing decision-making.
- Speaker 2 suggests looking into entrepreneurial finance literature for insights on milestone setting and resource allocation.
- Speaker 1 offers to share their presentation on observing startup attributes and their impact on investor perception.

### Using GPT for Perceptual Decoding in Venture Research

- Speaker 1 explains the use of GPT for perceptual decoding, asking questions about startup attributes and investor perception.
- Speaker 1 discusses the structural model or logic regression that can be created from GPT data.
