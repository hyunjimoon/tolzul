Feedback on Angie's paper
•⁠  ⁠Generic sequencing heuristics? Is it YC? Delta V? Design X? 
•⁠  ⁠Guidance failing when it ignored context? Great point and example that is provided here. 
•⁠  ⁠Agreed, that customer centered playbook mostly works for consumer apps but doesn’t work everywhere else, social impact included. 
•⁠  ⁠Like the STRAP name: Sequential Threshold Reduction for Actionable Perceptions
•⁠  ⁠Definitely understand the case for mobility ventures. 
•⁠  ⁠Love the term venture GPS. 
•⁠  ⁠I like the approach of what will make them say ‘yes’ because it’s not just the entrepreneur pivoting for market needs but understanding their needs while convincing the customer.
•⁠  ⁠I think the implication of future work should be BEL venture, using this theory we launch companies.
