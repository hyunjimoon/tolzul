Throughout our journey, we’ve amassed a set of **reference papers and frameworks** that inform our strategy. Each of these tools maps to certain mentors or phases of our venture development:

- **Fine (1985) “Manufacturing Strategy: Methodology and Illustration”** – A classic paper by Charles Fine (our advisor [[Charlie]]). _Summary:_ Provides a framework for aligning a company’s competitive strategy with its operational decisions, using a rigorous methodology. _Relevance:_ This helped us structure our thinking on production and partnership decisions. Charlie shared this with us when we were debating our [[Strategic Choice - Architecture vs Value Chain]], to ensure we considered how modular or integrated our approach should be from an operational standpoint. It basically taught us to match our experimental learning with long-term manufacturing/supply-chain strategy.
    
- **Fine (2022) “Operations Management for Entrepreneurship”** – A more recent work (white paper/lecture notes) by Charlie Fine, tailored to startups. _Summary:_ It outlines how operations management principles (like process optimization, rapid iteration, and supply chain design) can be applied in entrepreneurial settings. _Relevance:_ This paper reinforced our inclination to treat experimentation as an operations process – for example, using systematic iterations and feedback loops in product development. It gave formal backing (from an expert) to many practices we were adopting intuitively. We often cite lessons from this paper when explaining our approach to accelerators like [[MIT delta v Accelerator]], as it shows our methods are grounded in proven operations theory.
    
- **“NSS” Paper** – (Nickname for an academic paper often referenced in our discussions). _Summary:_ This research study (authors N., S., S. – exact reference pending) examines entrepreneurial search and learning under uncertainty, from a Bayesian perspective. It likely models how entrepreneurs update their beliefs as they gather information (e.g., how much experimenting is optimal). _Relevance:_ Vikash introduced this paper during our early hypothesis phase as a cautionary guide. It provided evidence on the importance of staged experimentation – essentially validating that our incremental, **Bayesian learning** approach is the right way to go. The paper’s findings remind us to calibrate the size of our bets: start small, update beliefs, then commit more as confidence grows. It served as a bridge between theory and our practical strategy, helping both the optimists and skeptics on our team find common ground in data-driven search.
    
- **Chandra (2025) “Domain-Specific Planning Memo”** – An internal memo written by our co-founder (Angie Chandra) as part of our planning process. _Summary:_ This memo outlines a tailored framework for planning experiments in the **mobility domain** specifically. It integrates domain knowledge (like transportation patterns, city stakeholder interests) with our test-and-learn approach. _Relevance:_ We developed this to ensure our experimental designs weren’t generic but addressed the key uncertainties unique to mobility startups (e.g., rider adoption rates, regulatory feedback cycles). The memo maps out phases of our venture (pilot with a city block, then a district, then city-wide) with learning goals at each phase. It has been a living document we update as we gain new insights. This tool keeps us grounded in the real-world context of mobility even as we use abstract frameworks – acting as a checklist so that our Bayesian experiments remain _practically relevant_ to solving mobility challenges.
    
- **Vanden Steen (2016) “Formal Strategy”** – A scholarly article by Eric Van den Steen. _Summary:_ Proposes a formal theoretical definition of strategy and how having a clear, coherent strategy can guide decision-making and coordination in a company. It emphasizes the role of a strategist’s beliefs in setting a direction that others follow. _Relevance:_ [[Scott]] pointed us to this work to help articulate our strategy crisply. It underlined the idea that our venture’s strategy should be the _smallest set of choices_ that drive all other decisions. This influenced how we frame our core strategy (for example, choosing our primary customer segment and key value proposition early, so that everything from experiments to partnerships aligns with that choice). It also resonates with our belief-driven approach – in a sense, our _prior beliefs_ form the core of our strategy, and we update around that core. Using this formal lens, we improved how we communicate our strategy to others (investors, team members) and ensure our daily experiments don’t stray from our strategic focus.
    
- **Other Tools & Resources:** We also tapped into various talks and technical resources to supplement our learning. For instance, **MIT Mobility Initiative seminars** (YouTube lectures) provided insight on current industry trends and network effects, which Jinhua directed us to. An **Arxiv paper on Nested Logit models (Aboutaleb et al., 2020)** gave us ideas on modeling choice behavior for our service (helpful in refining our [[Probabilistic Mental Modeling]]). Additionally, we used a “Choosing Technology Framework” (an internal slide deck nicknamed _ChooseTech_) to evaluate which core technologies to prioritize – balancing factors like feasibility, user value, and synergy with partners. Each of these tools came into play at different phases: early design, mid-stage validation, or strategic pivot points. By keeping a curated library of such references, we ensure our approach is **informed by the best available knowledge** and can map each big decision to either a person’s advice or a proven framework.
