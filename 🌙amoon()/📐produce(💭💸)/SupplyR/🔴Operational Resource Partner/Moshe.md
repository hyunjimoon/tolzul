**Moshe** is a technical advisor who engages deeply with our experimental methods. In conversations with Moshe, he often toggles between optimism and skepticism in a nuanced way – encouraging big ideas but also **insisting on disciplined validation**. A key insight from Moshe is the importance of _making sense of results_ just as much as running tests. He stresses **careful interpretation of experimental data**, a process we term [[Rational Meaning Construction]]. Moshe often reminds us that _“data shouldn’t be cherry-picked to fit our story; rather, our story must evolve from the data.”_ This perspective has influenced how we design our [[Test-and-Learn Experimentation]] cycles – with deliberate checkpoints to analyze and update our beliefs. Moshe’s incentive is to ensure our technology truly works (he won’t be satisfied with surface-level wins). He has been somewhat skeptical about quick fixes or hyped trends, nudging us to dig deeper. At the same time, he’s **optimistic about rigorous experimentation**: when we follow a solid methodology, Moshe is confident we’ll uncover valuable insights and achieve breakthroughs. For instance, he was supportive of our networked experiment approach (see [[Networked Learning Experiments]]), which treats each trial as part of a connected knowledge system. Overall, Moshe plays the role of a _rational coach_ – he fuels our ambition to innovate, but within a framework of evidence and learning.
