**Charlie** is an academic mentor (a seasoned professor in operations and strategy) who provides a big-picture outlook. He is firmly on the **optimistic** side of the spectrum when it comes to entrepreneurial ventures. Charlie constantly encourages us to **think ambitiously and leverage our strengths**. For example, he supported our decision to integrate cutting-edge frameworks into our venture – many of which align with his own work. Charlie introduced us to foundational tools like Fine’s _Manufacturing Strategy_ methodology and a recent Operations-for-Entrepreneurs paper (see [[Key Papers and Tools]]). These have helped shape strategic decisions such as our [[Strategic Choice - Architecture vs Value Chain]]. Charlie’s optimism manifests in his advice: he often says _“don’t be afraid to architect the future you want to see,”_ nudging us toward platform thinking and ecosystem play. Unlike more cautious mentors like [[Vikash]], Charlie tends to **minimize false negatives** – he’d rather we try a bold experiment and learn it doesn’t work than shy away and miss a big opportunity. This positive pressure ensures we maintain momentum. Charlie also has a collaborative ethos; he has connected us with other experts and potential partners, believing that a strong network can amplify our innovation (echoing our [[Innovation Ecosystem Strategy]] concept). In essence, Charlie serves as a champion for our vision, bolstering our confidence and providing theoretical frameworks to underpin our practical moves.
