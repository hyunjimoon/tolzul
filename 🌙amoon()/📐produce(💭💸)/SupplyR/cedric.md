# Required Survey Data Collection

## Missing Data Elements for the Bayesian Model

The current database contains valuable information about ventures but lacks critical elements needed for the Bayesian Decision Model. Below are the key data elements that need to be collected through surveys:

### 1. Stakeholder-Specific State Assessment (<span style="color:#4caf50">S Vector</span>)

**Required Data:**

- Current binary approval status (0/1) from each stakeholder
- Specific identification of key stakeholders in each category

**Survey Questions:**

- "Name your primary target customer segment: _______"
- "Has this customer segment committed to buying your product? (Yes/No)"
- "Name your most important operational resource partner: _______"
- "Has this partner agreed to collaborate with you? (Yes/No)"
- "Who is your primary potential investor or funding source? _______"
- "Have they committed to investing in your venture? (Yes/No)"

### 2. Action Cost Assessment (<span style="color:#f44336">C Matrix</span>)

**Required Data:**

- Time, money, and effort required for each action type
- Relative costs across different actions

**Survey Questions:**

- "How long would it take (in weeks) to acquire your first paying customer?"
- "How long would it take (in weeks) to secure a partnership with your operational resource partner?"
- "How long would it take (in weeks) to secure funding from your target investor?"
- "Alternatively, distribute 100 points across these three activities based on their difficulty/cost"

### 3. State Transition Assessment (<span style="color:#2196f3">D Matrix</span>)

**Required Data:**

- Probability estimates for how actions affect stakeholder approval
- Spillover effects between stakeholders

**Survey Questions:**

- "If you secured your operational partnership, what is the likelihood (0-100%) that your target customer would then decide to buy?"
- "If you secured a customer, what is the likelihood (0-100%) that your target investor would then decide to invest?"
- "If you secured investment, what is the likelihood (0-100%) that your operational partner would then decide to collaborate?"

### 4. Stakeholder Weights (<span style="color:#9c27b0">W Vector</span>)

**Required Data:**

- Relative importance of each stakeholder to the venture
- Industry-specific weight patterns

**Survey Questions:**

- "Distribute 100 points across these three stakeholders based on their importance to your venture's success right now:"
    - Customer approval: ___
    - Operational partner approval: ___
    - Investor approval: ___

### 5. Uncertainty Assessment (<span style="color:#3399FF">U Vector</span>)

**Required Data:**

- Current perceived uncertainty for each stakeholder
- Factors contributing to uncertainty

**Survey Questions:**

- "How confident are you (0-100%) in your understanding of what your target customer needs?"
- "How confident are you (0-100%) in your understanding of what your operational partner requires?"
- "How confident are you (0-100%) in your understanding of what your potential investor is looking for?"

## Survey Implementation Guidelines

Based on the Bayesian Entrepreneurship Lab transcript, the following implementation approaches are recommended:

### 1. Dynamic Survey Design

Start with identification questions that personalize later questions:

```
Page 1: "Who are your 2-3 target customer segments?"
Page 2: "Who are your 1-2 potential operational partners?"
Page 3: "Who are your 1-2 potential investors?"

[Later questions automatically include these names]
"How long would it take to get [Customer Name from Page 1] to commit to a purchase?"
```

### 2. Visual Matrix Representation

Use visual elements to make the state transition matrix more intuitive:

- Geometric figures showing states (000 â†’ 111)
- Color coding for different stakeholders
- Interactive elements to adjust probabilities

### 3. Industry-Specific Templates

Create different survey versions for key industries mentioned in the transcript:

- Materials (cement, asphalt, etc.)
- Hardware
- Software
- Climate tech

### 4. Comparative Difficulty Rating

Use ratio-based questions to simplify cognitive load:

```
"If persuading a testing facility has a difficulty of 1,
how difficult would it be to persuade:
- A customer? ___
- An investor? ___"
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Database

Design the survey to complement, not duplicate, existing database fields:

- Pre-fill known information
- Focus questions on dynamic state assessment rather than static venture attributes
- Capture temporal data (how states change over time)

### 6. Data Collection Timeline

The transcript suggests starting with the materials industry as a "beachhead":

1. Test survey with 3 materials companies first
2. Refine based on feedback
3. Expand to other industries
4. Create comparative industry models
