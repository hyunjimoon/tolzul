**MIT delta v** is the Martin Trust Center’s premier student venture accelerator, geared toward launching sustainable startups. It functions like an investor, providing seed funding, workspace, and intensive mentorship through the summer. To succeed in delta v, we must demonstrate **evidence of traction or validated learning** – they look for teams who have run experiments, learned from customers, and pivoted intelligently. Our emphasis on Bayesian, experiment-driven development is a selling point: we can show delta v mentors a clear history of hypotheses tested and insights gained. This aligns with delta v’s philosophy of quickly de-risking a venture. By the program’s end, we aim to present a venture with a **proven ecosystem strategy** and a clear path to impact in mobility, which will make us attractive for follow-on investors.
