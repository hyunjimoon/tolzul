| Understand                 | Define the core problem, identify whose problem it is, and determine who needs to be involved .                                            | [[Innovation Ecosystem Strategy]], [[Inclusive entrepreneurship]], [[Bayesian Entrepreneurship in Mobility Ecosystems]], [[Decision-making under uncertainty]], [[Stakeholder belief alignment]] | In this initial phase, teams adopt an outward-looking perspective: understanding the problem’s context encourages [[Innovation Ecosystem Strategy]] by considering all stakeholders and environmental factors. Engaging those who face the problem directly reflects [[inclusive entrepreneurship]], ensuring diverse voices shape the venture from the start. This evidence-gathering approach aligns with [[Bayesian entrepreneurship]]—founders begin with hypotheses about the problem and update their beliefs as they collect data. By clarifying stakeholder needs and expectations early, entrepreneurs lay the groundwork for [[stakeholder belief alignment]], building a shared understanding of the venture’s purpose. Altogether, deeply understanding the problem reduces unknowns and informs better [[decision-making under uncertainty]], empowering founders with a rational basis for subsequent design decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Design                     | Design a solution that best fits the problem and creates value; iteratively test, learn, and build that solution .                         | [[Test-and-Learn Experimentation]], [[Decomposing Experiments]], [[Founder empowerment]], [[Learning-through-experimentation]], [[Bayesian entrepreneurship]]                                    | The Design phase is driven by experimentation; teams rapidly prototype and test solution ideas, exemplifying a [[Test-and-Learn Experimentation]] approach. By breaking big assumptions into smaller tests (practicing decomposed experimentation), founders tackle uncertainty in manageable pieces and embody a [[Test-and-Learn Experimentation]] mindset, where the venture progresses via continuous feedback and adaptation. Such a process operationalizes [[Bayesian Entrepreneurship in Mobility Ecosystems]]: each experiment provides new evidence, and founders update their direction based on what they learn (just as one updates a prior belief with new data). Importantly, this phase empowers founders by giving them tangible validation of what works; seeing experiments inform progress builds confidence and decision-making autonomy. The focus on designing for value also ensures the solution remains aligned with stakeholder needs identified earlier, reinforcing the inclusive, evidence-driven ethos of Angie and Charlie’s model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Envision                   | Develop a sustainable business model and assemble a team to make the solution a reality .                                                  | [[Innovation Ecosystem Strategy]][[Stakeholder belief alignment]], [[Inclusive entrepreneurship]], [[Rational Meaning Construction]], [[Probabilistic Mental Modeling]]                          | In Envision, the venture’s scope widens from product to strategy as founders consider how their solution operates within a larger ecosystem—crafting a business model becomes an exercise in [[ecosystem strategy]], aligning the venture’s value proposition with partners, market forces, and long-term sustainability. This broader view naturally involves [[stakeholder belief alignment]]: entrepreneurs must ensure that co-founders, team members, and investors share a common vision of how the venture will create and capture value. If the startup’s mission addresses social or underserved needs, this phase also reinforces [[inclusive entrepreneurship]], embedding inclusivity into the business strategy (e.g., building a diverse team or accessible offerings). As founders articulate the venture’s story and model, they engage in [[Rational Meaning Construction]]—formulating a logical narrative that connects the problem, solution, and impact in a way that resonates with stakeholders’ beliefs. Angie and Charlie’s framework also encourages analytical tools here; for example, founders might use [[probabilistic modeling]] to project scenarios (market growth, revenue, costs) and make data-informed decisions about their model. By envisioning organizational structure and strategy under uncertainty, entrepreneurs practice strategic thinking while remaining adaptable, staying true to the learning mindset even as they plan for scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Deploy                     | Plan for scaling the venture’s impact, including go-to-market, fundraising, and communication strategies to deploy and grow the solution . | [[Ecosystem strategy]], [[Stakeholder belief alignment]], [[Founder empowerment]], [[Inclusive entrepreneurship]], [[Decision-making under uncertainty]]                                         | The Deploy phase focuses on execution and impact, bringing all strategic values to the forefront. Scaling a venture demands [[ecosystem strategy]]—founders must navigate relationships with partners, regulators, and competitors, ensuring the growth plan complements the wider ecosystem (e.g., leveraging networks or platform effects). Successful deployment also hinges on [[stakeholder belief alignment]]: founders align investors, customers, and team members around the venture’s goals and growth narrative, often through compelling storytelling and validated metrics (an outcome of prior learning and meaning-making). The act of fundraising and negotiating deals at this stage tests [[founder empowerment]]: equipped with a deep understanding of their venture (and tools like scenario analysis), founders can advocate for their vision on equal footing, making decisions that protect their long-term interests. [[Inclusive entrepreneurship]] remains pertinent as the venture scales—by reaching broader markets and fostering inclusive hiring or partnerships, the startup extends its mission of inclusivity into its growth strategy. Throughout Deploy, uncertainty persists (market reception, operational challenges), so founders continue practicing [[decision-making under uncertainty]] in real time. The [[Test-and-Learn Experimentation]] philosophy carries forward as well (e.g., pilot launches or iterative rollouts), ensuring the venture keeps learning and adapting even at scale. In sum, the Deploy phase translates the venture’s design into real-world impact while staying adaptive, stakeholder-aligned, and true to the inclusive, learning-driven values of Angie and Charlie’s framework. |
