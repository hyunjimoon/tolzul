Optimization Formulation Table

| U (Uncertainty Vector)   | Residual uncertainty about whether each stakeholder will accept the venture's value proposition                          | For Sublime Systems: Uncertainty about whether testing facilities will approve their low-carbon cement, whether construction companies will adopt it, and whether investors will fund it |
| S (State Vector)         | Binary representation of stakeholder acceptance (1) or non-acceptance (0) for customer, operations partner, and investor | Initial state might be (0,0,0) with the goal to reach (1,1,1) where all stakeholders accept                                                                                              |
| A (Action Vector)        | Entrepreneur's decisions on whether to segment (marketing), collaborate (operations), or capitalize (fundraising)        | For Sublime Systems: Deciding to focus first on collaborating with cement testing facilities                                                                                             |

| R (Resources)            | Available resources for the venture to use in actions                                                                    | Sublime Systems' available capital, time, and connections to pursue actions                                                                                                              |

## Understanding the Database to Matrix Mapping

Based on the transcript discussions and the database layout provided, I can now propose how the existing database structure would map to the optimization variables (B, C, D matrices) in the Bayesian entrepreneurship model.

### Mapping from Database to B Matrix (State to Uncertainty)

The B matrix represents how a venture's state impacts uncertainty across stakeholders. From the database:

- **CustomerValueProposition** table: Contains information about industry, venture type, and value proposition that would affect customer uncertainty
- **FounderBackground** table: Experience and background that would affect investor uncertainty
- **StartupJourney** table: Success indicators that would affect all stakeholder uncertainties

### Mapping from Database to C Matrix (Action to Cost)

The C matrix represents the cost of various actions (segment, collaborate, capitalize). From the database:

- **Funding** table: Contains information on resources available (total_amount_raised, latest_valuation)
- **Marketing** table: Represents some segmentation costs through marketing channels
- **StartupJourney**: number_of_pivots can indicate previous action costs

### Mapping from Database to D Matrix (State Transition)

The D matrix represents how actions change the venture's state. This is the most complex and might require additional data not currently in the database:

- **StartupJourney**: within_3_years_success and post_three_years_success could help derive historical transition probabilities
- **Funding**: funding rounds progression could show state transitions following capitalization actions

It's worth noting that while the database has extensive information about ventures, it doesn't explicitly track the three core actions (segment, collaborate, capitalize) or their impacts on state transitions over time. Additional data collection through the survey being developed would be needed to properly derive these matrices.

The proposed modeling approach uses binary states for simplicity at the early venture stage, with the goal of reaching a (1,1,1) state where all three key stakeholders (customer, operations partner, investor) accept the venture's value proposition, enabling scaling.

Would you like me to go deeper into any specific aspect of this mapping or further analyze how the database could be enhanced to better capture the B, C, D matrices?
