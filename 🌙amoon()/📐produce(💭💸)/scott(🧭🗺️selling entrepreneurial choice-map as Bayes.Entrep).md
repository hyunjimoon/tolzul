|                                                       | 2.Homo Entrepreneuricus                                                                 | introduces the Homo Entrepreneuricus model itself. It describes how entrepreneurs hold subjective priors that let them see opportunities others dismiss, and how they pursue theory-based experimentation to validate those beliefs. It explicitly maps to N1 (by explaining why an entrepreneur‚Äôs idiosyncratic opportunity valuation isn‚Äôt just bias but stems from private information/beliefs) and to N2 (by showing that entrepreneurs systematically update their beliefs via experiments rather than assuming a shared prior or passively waiting). The chapter highlights the ‚Äúbold, contrarian beliefs with a scientific approach‚Äù that define Homo Entrepreneuricus, directly underpinning both need areas. It is the cornerstone for understanding theory-driven learning under heterogenous beliefs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It aligns with N1, as it addresses the debate of behavioral bias vs. Bayesian rationality under constraints. The authors review how entrepreneurs make decisions under uncertainty and whether apparent over-optimism, heuristics, or ‚Äúclueless‚Äù behavior might actually reflect rational choices given their subjective priors and information limits. For example, what might look like overconfidence can be interpreted as an entrepreneur‚Äôs genuinely higher prior about success. The chapter‚Äôs findings support the idea that entrepreneurs are not simply erratic or biased, but often ‚ÄúBayesian machines‚Äù operating with imperfect information, consistent with N1‚Äôs focus on information-constrained belief formation. It reinforces that some biases may be adaptive responses to uncertainty, thus bridging to the Homo Entrepreneuricus perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It shows that the design of experiments is influenced by the entrepreneur‚Äôs prior and that those experiments generate signals which inform the entrepreneur‚Äôs own belief (learning) and help convince outsiders. This directly speaks to N2: entrepreneurs use market experiments to evolve their beliefs, and because others may not share their priors, the entrepreneur must sometimes engage in ‚ÄúBayesian persuasion‚Äù ‚Äì presenting credible experimental evidence to align investors or partners with their vision. The chapter demonstrates that what entrepreneurs test, and how, depends on their information and expectations, mirroring Homo Entrepreneuricus‚Äô resource-rational experimentation strategy. It also touches on an extended need of persuasion under heterogenous beliefs (since non-shared beliefs mean convincing stakeholders is crucial). In sum, Chapter 8 maps to N1 by acknowledging distinct priors in entrepreneurial finance, and to N2 by detailing theory-driven experiments and learning as well as the communication of those learnings to reduce belief divergence.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|                                                       | 9.Learning from Data                                                                    | This chapter centers on how entrepreneurs gather and interpret data from experiments, highlighting the ‚Äúscientific‚Äù learning process. It is a strong match for N2 (market-driven belief evolution) and the refined experimentation need. Chapter 9 underscores the central role of data and evidence in entrepreneurial learning, discussing methods to collect and analyze information so that updates to beliefs are meaningful and actionable. In the Homo Entrepreneuricus spirit, it stresses that accurate, timely, well-structured information improves belief updates and that entrepreneurs must manage noise and bias in experimental data. This speaks to the resource-rational updating aspect of N2 ‚Äì entrepreneurs strive to extract clear signals from limited market experiments. The chapter effectively maps to N2 by providing a framework for how subjective beliefs evolve through experimentation. It also implicitly supports N1: because data from experiments is often ambiguous, entrepreneurs rely on their prior frameworks to interpret results. Overall, Chapter 9 reinforces the importance of systematic experimentation and skillful data interpretation in the Bayesian approach to entrepreneurship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                                                       | 10.Charting (and Updating) the Path: A Bayesian Perspective on Entrepreneurial Learning | chapter examines continuous Bayesian updating and its impact on entrepreneurial strategy over time. It directly addresses N2‚Äôs theme of belief evolution by illustrating how iterative belief revisions from sequential experiments lead to better decisions. For example, it formalizes how entrepreneurs adaptively learn when to pivot, persevere, or stop a venture based on accumulating evidence. This is quintessential Homo Entrepreneuricus behavior ‚Äì using a stream of market feedback to continually update one‚Äôs course. Chapter 10 provides formal models showing that entrepreneurs benefit from a dynamic learning strategy, which is aligned with having a theory-based plan that gets constantly refined (mapping to the experimental aspect of the quadrant). It supports N2 by emphasizing that ongoing Bayesian updating is essential to navigate uncertainty, rather than assuming eventual consensus or a static decision rule. Additionally, by noting entrepreneurs‚Äô ‚Äúbias for action‚Äù to generate new data and the idea that the value of an experiment depends on one‚Äôs prior, this chapter also ties back to N1/N3: it acknowledges both the existence of heterogeneous prior beliefs (entrepreneurs are often more optimistic than others) and the importance of designed experimentation in entrepreneurial learning. In summary, Chapter 10 vividly maps onto N2 and the Homo Entrepreneuricus modus operandi by detailing how continuous, resource-rational updating drives venture success. |

It describes how entrepreneurs hold subjective priors that let them see opportunities others dismiss, and how they pursue theory-based experimentation to validate those beliefs. It explicitly maps to N1 (by explaining why an entrepreneur‚Äôs idiosyncratic opportunity valuation isn‚Äôt just bias but stems from private information/beliefs) and to N2 (by showing that entrepreneurs systematically update their beliefs via experiments rather than assuming a shared prior or passively waiting). The chapter highlights the ‚Äúbold, contrarian beliefs with a scientific approach‚Äù that define Homo Entrepreneuricus, directly underpinning both need areas.

It aligns with N1, as it addresses the debate of behavioral bias vs. Bayesian rationality under constraints. The authors review how entrepreneurs make decisions under uncertainty and whether apparent over-optimism, heuristics, or ‚Äúclueless‚Äù behavior might actually reflect rational choices given their subjective priors and information limits. For example, what might look like overconfidence can be interpreted as an entrepreneur‚Äôs genuinely higher prior about success. The chapter‚Äôs findings support the idea that entrepreneurs are not simply erratic or biased, but often ‚ÄúBayesian machines‚Äù operating with imperfect information, consistent with N1‚Äôs focus on information-constrained belief formation. It reinforces that some biases may be adaptive responses to uncertainty, thus bridging to the Homo Entrepreneuricus perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It shows that the design of experiments is influenced by the entrepreneur‚Äôs prior and that those experiments generate signals which inform the entrepreneur‚Äôs own belief (learning) and help convince outsiders. This directly speaks to N2: entrepreneurs use market experiments to evolve their beliefs, and because others may not share their priors, the entrepreneur must sometimes engage in ‚ÄúBayesian persuasion‚Äù ‚Äì presenting credible experimental evidence to align investors or partners with their vision. The chapter demonstrates that what entrepreneurs test, and how, depends on their information and expectations, mirroring Homo Entrepreneuricus‚Äô resource-rational experimentation strategy. It also touches on an extended need of persuasion under heterogenous beliefs (since non-shared beliefs mean convincing stakeholders is crucial). In sum, Chapter 8 maps to N1 by acknowledging distinct priors in entrepreneurial finance, and to N2 by detailing theory-driven experiments and learning as well as the communication of those learnings to reduce belief divergence.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It is a strong match for N2 (market-driven belief evolution) and the refined experimentation need. Chapter 9 underscores the central role of data and evidence in entrepreneurial learning, discussing methods to collect and analyze information so that updates to beliefs are meaningful and actionable. In the Homo Entrepreneuricus spirit, it stresses that accurate, timely, well-structured information improves belief updates and that entrepreneurs must manage noise and bias in experimental data. This speaks to the resource-rational updating aspect of N2 ‚Äì entrepreneurs strive to extract clear signals from limited market experiments. The chapter effectively maps to N2 by providing a framework for how subjective beliefs evolve through experimentation. It also implicitly supports N1: because data from experiments is often ambiguous, entrepreneurs rely on their prior frameworks to interpret results. Overall, Chapter 9 reinforces the importance of systematic experimentation and skillful data interpretation in the Bayesian approach to entrepreneurship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It directly addresses N2‚Äôs theme of belief evolution by illustrating how iterative belief revisions from sequential experiments lead to better decisions. For example, it formalizes how entrepreneurs adaptively learn when to pivot, persevere, or stop a venture based on accumulating evidence. This is quintessential Homo Entrepreneuricus behavior ‚Äì using a stream of market feedback to continually update one‚Äôs course. Chapter 10 provides formal models showing that entrepreneurs benefit from a dynamic learning strategy, which is aligned with having a theory-based plan that gets constantly refined (mapping to the experimental aspect of the quadrant). It supports N2 by emphasizing that ongoing Bayesian updating is essential to navigate uncertainty, rather than assuming eventual consensus or a static decision rule. Additionally, by noting entrepreneurs‚Äô ‚Äúbias for action‚Äù to generate new data and the idea that the value of an experiment depends on one‚Äôs prior, this chapter also ties back to N1/N3: it acknowledges both the existence of heterogeneous prior beliefs (entrepreneurs are often more optimistic than others) and the importance of designed experimentation in entrepreneurial learning. In summary, Chapter 10 vividly maps onto N2 and the Homo Entrepreneuricus modus operandi by detailing how continuous, resource-rational updating drives venture success. |

I'm devoted to combining Scott Stern and Charlie Fine's research on entrepreneurial strategy and operation. Scott's strategic choice among disruptor, architectural, value chain, IP strategy is a compassüß≠and Charlie's phase-based learning is a map üó∫Ô∏è. Combined they can serve personalized navigation and moreover suggest alternate routes.

Furthermore, early stage scholars have the right to be benefited from this tool. Knowing the existence of different strategy and paths in reaching their goal would encourage them to be more visionary.

nss_gps stands for nail-scale-sail global positioning system and it leverages genAI's information retrieval capability for operation and innovation management. Charlie Fine has been developed nss from early 2000 e.g. https://operations4entrepreneurs.com/.

From below, nss_gps is framed as a tool for startups just as an example. As the need for operation and innovation management (e.g. how and when to segment, processify, acculturate, professionalize, automate, collaborate, capitalize, platformize, replicate, evaluate) is shared by both startups (e.g. Lucid, VinFast, Rivian) and established companies (e.g. Hyundai, Tesla), nss_gps would architecturally support wide range of use-case. More in blueprint below.

# roadmap
![image](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/8325fcaf-388c-4ad4-8d6b-061a4ac8ecee)

## 1. solution development process: supply, design, develop, launch. 
### 1.1. supply
Introduce each individual's capability. Angie and Charlie shares experience of pivoting from an non-successful startup organization. In terms of domain, Angie and Charlie has experienced different types of business (B2B, B2C, B2G (government)). For educational organization, Charlie was initial dean of Asian school of business and Angie is manager of Bayesian computation community (StanKorea, 1.03k subscribers). We have not only expertise, but also  good network with MIT TIES group (Fiona Murray, Scott Stern, Bill Autlet, Eric von Hippel), Singapore SMART innovation center (Howard Califano), Korea SNU's innovation center (Janggil Kim, Ensuk Seo). 
### 1.2. design
NSS_GPS for entrepreneurs, which combines Charlie's NSS, TIES group's entreprenerial compass, and Angie's actionable workflow. 

1.2.1. NSS [1] is a sequential three time stages of startup in its lifecycle. The nail stage involves rapidly iterating to establish a viable value proposition and business model. The scale stage involves growing the company by building capabilities and processes to serve an expanding market. Finally, the sail stage is when growth slows and the focus turns to incremental improvement and sustaining the now-mature business. 

1.2.2. entreprenerial compass [2] is four strategical directions to develop ideas of each startup. Intellectual property strategy focuses on gaining control of innovations through patents and trademarks, and collaborating to reduce costs. The value chain strategy aims to be the preferred partner in a slice of an industry's value chain through strong execution and collaboration. The disruption strategy targets underserved segments and uses iteration and learning to expand. Finally, the architectural strategy creates an entirely new value chain by controlling a key resource or interface that coordinates multiple stakeholders to provide new consumer value.

1.2.3. Actionable workflow [3]  is an entrepreneurial decision making architecture. Iterative testing of how 1. needs of stakeholders, 2. structural knowledge of experts, 3. machine learning methods come together is the key. It hinges upon Simulation based calibration, widely adapted testing framework in Bayesian community, which can check whether the implementation of statistical and computational model align with our expectation (prior knowledge). Based on its graphical unalignment signal, one can converge to a consistent model, more quickly and reliably. 

### 1.3. develop (todo)
theory
- NSS needs simplification or dynamic introduction to prevent cognitive overload
- entreprenerial compass needs to dynamic learning component embedded
- Actionable workflow needs architectural update for automating the iteration so that its product, explainable policy, can be broadly distributed

- the three can be combined under Bayesian decision making [4] framework

tool: system architecture to combine the three is needed to establish database 

### 1.4. launch
theory (mens)
1st launch (Jan.2023): 15.785 digital product management projects
2nd launch (Spring.2024): 15.785 digital product management course

tool (manus)
1st launch (Sep.2023): AI product management demo day (with Charlie Fine)
2nd launch (Oct.2023): System dynamic research seminar (with Tom Fiddaman)
3rd launch (March.2024): Bayesian Entrepreneurship conference (with Scott Stern, Charlie Fine)

## 2. fulfillment process: supply, produce, distribute, sell, customer. 
### 2.1. supply
theory: scaling up experimental social, behavioral, and economic science (Abdullah Almaatouq [5], Thomas Mallone)

tool: combine LLM on probablistic programming language (PPL) framework (Vikash Mansinghka [6])
### 2.2. produce
theory: 1st (Aug.2023): this proposal
tool: 1st (Sep.2023): AI product management demo day (with Charlie Fine) - pivot after feedback from 1st production

### 2.3. distribute
theory: 1st (Fall.2023) project for Jinhua and Scott's class, combining AI and entrepreneurship, upload on arxiv
tool:1st (Sep.2023) make first version of strategy chat service available online

### 2.4. sell
theory: get positive response on theoretical contribution from TIES group and M3S project members
tool: get positive response on practical contribution  startsups, mentors, VCs

### 2.5 customer
alpha: delta v's eleven cohorts (~200), 15.785 digital product management students (~100), 15S.10 students (~30)
beta: startups using online NSS_GPS service

## 3. need development process: supply, design, develop.
Before the theory and tools become concretely proposed, we should develop its need by introducing the usefulness of NSS, entrepreneurial compass, actionable workflow to the public. 
### 3.1. supply

theoretical and practical discoveries as we go through solution development process and fulfillment process.
### 3.2. design (todo) 

construct three scenarios of how the proposed tool and/or theory can sovle the problem of potential customer

### 3.3. develop

Linkedin post like [7] show how quality and quantity of potential customers are updated.

### 64, 2, 1 >> 2, 1

Regarding implementing the entrepreneurial compass idea, I think this is connected to our justification of automatization and/or starting from the joint space then observe emergence. I wish to suggest auto_test 64, manual_test 2, choose 1 with computation & chatbot‚Äôs help in auto_test, outperforms choose 2 test 1 (c2t1). 

64 is from 4 scenario ([compete, collab] x [control, execute]  at each NSS).
Scott‚Äôs c2t1 logic from the attached paper uses Bayes rule which I summarized as below.

[[Bayesian Workflow and Startup Operations]]
## Reply from hyunjimoon on 2023-09-18T12:06:43Z

First Final draft based on https://chat.openai.com/share/a67aef02-7043-482e-99f7-286064507cc4

# Bayesian Workflow and Startup Operations

## 1. Analogy between Bayesian workflow and Startup operations
The Bayesian workflow is a principled approach to statistical modeling and decision-making, consisting of three main steps: model building, inference, and model checking/improvement. The Bayesian community has evolved from focusing on Bayesian inference to embracing a more comprehensive Bayesian workflow (Gelman et al, 2022). This shift parallels the transition in entrepreneurship from focusing on entrepreneurial compass, which suggests directions, to a more operational approach that provides the tools to move towards certain direction. This paper aims to draw an analogy between Bayesian workflows and startup operations, exploring how quick, easy, reliable model growth enabled by Bayesian workflow can be applied for entrepreneurial growth. Key analogy is, just as computational representation of mathematical model evolves to pair itself with observed data in Bayesian workflow, organizational representation of business model adapt itself with data from demand. This pair is also known as market-product or need-solution pair. Co-evolution of pair has been raised in Von Hippel and Von Krogh (2016). 

## 2: Bayesian Workflow Components and Models
The Bayesian workflow is organized around three main components: P (joint probability distribution), A (posterior approximator), and D (observed data). **P** represents the joint distribution over observable quantities $\tilde{y}$ and latent parameters $\theta$. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models and Bayesian linear regression. **A** is the tools, methods, algorithms used to approximate the true posterior distribution, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or Variational Inference. **D** refers to the actual data points observed, like measurements in a scientific experiment or user interaction data in a machine learning application. These components can be assembled to make different types of model: P, PD, PA, and PAD. **P Models** represent the foundational models describing data generation. **PD Models** combine P with observed data \(D\), yielding an analytic posterior. **PA Models** combine P with a posterior approximator \(A\). **PAD Models** integrate all three components to approximate the true posterior distribution. Formal definitions, details, examples in Appendix.

## 3: Startup Operations Components 
In the context of startups, P, A, and D components can be mapped to business model, scaling tool, and observed market data, respectively. P represents business model, starting from long term planning on orientation and investment to short term control on customer, technology, competition, product, organization. A represents scaling tools that can implement business models. D would be real-world market data, such as customer behavior and sales figures. These components can also be combined into different models in startup operations: P, PD, PA, and PAD. P Models could represent different business strategies. PD Models would combine the business model with real-world market data. PA Models would combine the business model with analytical tools. PAD Models would integrate the business model, scaling tools, and real-world market data. PAD is the ideal destination for a scaling startup but different evolutionary paths exist, so strategies could be dynamically adjusted along one's lifecycle.

![image](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/982e0642-b133-4b94-816d-32e02f27fb0f)
Figure 1: Analogy between Bayesian workflow and startup operations

#### P - Business Model
- **P** in startups could represent the core business model, including elements like product features, market strategy, and organizational structure. For example, a startup in the renewable energy sector might focus on solar panel efficiency, government subsidies, and partnerships with construction firms. A health tech startup's P model may include variables like patient engagement, telehealth features, and partnerships with healthcare providers. SaaS startup might have a P model that includes variables like subscription pricing, feature sets, and target customer demographics. 
- can be represented in three tier tree format from entrepreneurial strategy, business model feature, product feature. Entrepreneurial strategies are investment (execute or control) and orientation (collaborate or compete) and business model features are technology (length 4 vector), customer (length 4 vector), organization (length 4 vector), competition (length 4 vector). 
- e.g. of parameter space of organization (with @chasfine) are size, location (geographical - sitting in the office), direct report to ceo (decentralization), percentage of technical degree and college education (what kind of people you hire (mit vs macdonalds)), what is the average compensation relative to industry (investing in your people / churn a lot, turnover, pay more, lower turnover / good or bad job), average turn or tenure, how much money they've been funded, round of funding, gone through ipo? which needs to be segmented into 4.

#### A - Scaling Tools
- **A** could represent tools that help refine or approximate the optimal business model. This includes data analytics platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and even decision-making frameworks like SWOT or PESTLE analysis.

#### D - Observed Market Data
- **D** would be the real-world market data that the startup collects. This could include customer behavior, sales figures, and market trends. For instance, a fintech startup might look at user engagement metrics, transaction volumes, and regulatory changes.

## 4: Growth Path to PAD model in Startup Operations 
To scale well, three components (business model P, scaling tools A, and real-world data D) should be harmoniously orchestrated.  Starting from one nailed component (among P, A, D), different growth paths exists to reach PAD. Principled guideline on when to focus on which component could enable quick, easy, reliable growth toward PAD.

<img width="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/a1dda66e-1a57-4418-b2e8-58c5a4010740">
Figure 2: Growth Path in Startup Operations 

- **PAD Models** would integrate the business model (P), scaling tools (A), and real-world market data (D). For instance, a startup might use machine learning algorithms (A) to analyze customer behavior data (D) and dynamically adjust its product recommendation engine (P). Also, a startup can simulate the impact of platformization (A) on their existing customer base (D) and overall business strategy (P).

- **PD Models** would combine the business model (P) with real-world market data (D). For instance, if a startup in the e-commerce sector observes that organic traffic is not converting well, the PD model would adjust to focus more on paid traffic and customer retention strategies. PD Models would combine the business model with real-world data, such as customer churn rates and Lifetime Value (LTV) calculations. For instance, if a startup observes higher churn rates than expected, the PD model would adjust the expected LTV of a customer downward.

- **PA Models** would combine the business model (P) with scaling tools (A) to approximate the success of different strategies without yet incorporating real-world data. For example, a startup might use predictive analytics to model the impact of a price change on customer acquisition rates. PA Models would be hypothetical scenarios where the startup explores how different scaling strategies (A) would impact their existing business model (P). For example, they might model the effects of expanding into a new market or launching a new product line.

## 5: Future Work and Research Questions
### Ex-Ante
1. Designing surveys for 700 participants and 150 startups in delta-v to extract P, A, D components.
2. Classifying the evolution of their business models, such as transitioning from P to PA to PAD or D to PD to PAD.
### Ex-Post
3. Extracting P, A, D components from existing case studies.
4. Classifying the business model evolution from existing case studies.

5. finding 4~10 dims. representation of high dimension business model features (technology, customer, organization, competition) 

By exploring these research questions, we can further validate and refine the analogy between Bayesian workflows and startup operations, providing a robust framework for both statistical modeling and entrepreneurial decision-making.

## Appendix
Formal definition and examples of component and model in Bayesian Workflow for further analogy. Refer to sections from Burkner et al (2022) for detail.

### P component - $p(y,Œ∏)$ 
- joint probability distribution  over observable quantities y and unobservable parameters Œ∏
- often factorize into a likelihood p(y|Œ∏) and a prior p(Œ∏) and are generative, allowing random sampling from the joint distribution.
- can have explicit likelihoods (P_E models) or implicit likelihoods (P_I models) requiring simulation.
- e.g. linear regression model with likelihood p(y|Œ∏) and prior p(Œ∏) where likelihood could be Gaussian, and the prior could be a normal distribution centered around zero (Section 2.2), Gaussian Mixture Model, \(P\) would define how data points are generated from multiple Gaussian distributions.

### A component - Posterior Approximator $P_A(\theta|y)$
- mechanism used to approximate the true posterior distribution. For instance, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is often used for complex models where traditional MCMC methods like Metropolis-Hastings are inefficient.
- Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers like Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Section 2.3)
- Variational inference (VI) methods that find an optimal parametric posterior approximation (Section 2.3)
- Neural density estimators like normalizing flows or sequential neural posterior estimation (Section 2.3)

### D component - Observed Data  $\tilde{y}$
- D can comprise any number of observations with arbitrary structure (Section 2.2)
- In PD models, D is the observed data ÃÉy combined with the P model (Section 2.2)
- In PAD models, D is the actual observed data ÃÉy used by the posterior approximator A (Section 2.4)

### PD Models $(p(y,Œ∏), \tilde{y})$
- P models combined with observed data \(D\). They yield the analytic posterior, which is the updated belief about the model parameters after observing data
- yield the analytic posterior p(Œ∏| ÃÉy) which integrates the joint distribution p(y,Œ∏) with the data ÃÉy.
-e.g. in a Bayesian A/B test, the PD model would combine the prior beliefs about conversion rates with the observed conversion data.

### PA Models
- theoretical constructs that combine a P model with a posterior approximator \(A\) but do not yet include observed data
- allow studying the scope of a P model before observed data is collected.
- useful for understanding the behavior of different approximators. 
- can utilize amortized or non-amortized approximator.
- e.g. one might use a PA model to compare the efficiency of Variational Inference against MCMC methods for a given P model.

### PAD Models
- **PAD Models** integrate all three components‚ÄîP, A, and D. 
- Aim to approximate the PD model using the approximator A
- Properties depend on the data ÃÉy which may not come from P itself (model misspecification).
- e.g. in a Bayesian neural network, the PAD model would include the network architecture (P), the observed training data (D), and a method like Variational Inference for approximation (A).

From:  Bayesian Workflow and Startup Operations:  

Paragraph 2 says **_"P represents the joint distribution over observable quantities y and latent parameters Œ∏. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models and Bayesian linear regression."_**

Paragraph 3 says:  "P represents business model, starting from long term planning on orientation and investment to short term control on customer, technology, competition, product, organization."

It is not clear to me how to connect or map the second sentence onto the first , or vice versa.  Could you provide a concrete example?  You do expand on the second sentence in the text that follows the first diagram, and you expand on the probability model in the appendix, but I don't see how to map them together.  

It might be useful to share the simplest version of the Gelman model with an a=illustration that Gelman might use, and then show the parallels and mapping as to how ot do this for the PAD model you propose for entrepreneurship.  

As one might ask ChatGPT:  Explain it to me as if I were a high school student :-)

Example for updating P, A, D and its typified path in https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/bayesian-workflow-gps-to-navigation/32864 (@tomfid might also be interested).

Evidence based testing i.e. adjusting the standard for Mammography (recommended to age > 45 to age > 35 woman, give caution sign to > 2micro gram of ? to >1 micro gram (numbers may be inaccurate) @okaranfil explained in https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/156#discussioncomment-6858155 is example of adjusted "good enough diagnostics" that affects further action. Different standard for diagnostic are simulated and tested beforehand, among which one chosen standard is presented to society as a form of a prior policy. I'm lacking knowledge on what the exact analogue for prior predictive, simulation-based calibration, posterior predictive check diagnostics would be in the above evidence-based testing context, but it would be useful to lay out this mapping.

@hyunjimoon's GPT‚Äôs analysis on ministry of supply:

‚Äúfew thoughts on how I might use the PAD framework and Bayesian workflow navigation ideas to make decisions after receiving bad diagnostics for the Ministry of Supply case:

P (business model feature + strategy) - The business model and strategy for Ministry of Supply seems quite strong overall. Their focus on technology-enabled high-performance professional apparel is a compelling value proposition. However, some aspects of their business model may need refinement, such as their approach to managing inventory and supply chain.

A (scaling tools) - Ministry of Supply relies heavily on analytics tools and partners for inventory forecasting, supply chain management, and fulfillment. These tools and partnerships are critical for scaling the business. However, there may be opportunities to improve how they are leveraged. For example, enhancing information sharing and coordination with partners.

D (observed data) - The observed bad diagnostics, such as high inventory variability, stockouts, and cash flow issues, provide critical signals about problems in the system. Digging deeper into the drivers behind this variability could uncover useful insights.

After receiving bad diagnostics, I would first try to update the analytics tools and processes (A) to improve forecasting, inventory management, and coordination with partners. If issues persist, I would look at refining the business model (P) by reconsidering sourcing strategies, supplier relationships, and inventory policies. I would also gather more fine-grained market data (D) to better understand demand patterns and variability. An iterative process of updating A, P, and D could help navigate towards a model that yields improved diagnostics. Frequent checkpoint assessments of key metrics would guide next steps. Collaborating across functions and partners would be critical throughout this process.‚Äù

Prompt was:
Imagine you are Aman Advani from case study attached. Could you elaborate on how you'd use the theory in specificed in ## GPS2Navigation from Bayesian workflow navigator to decide which action to take upon receiving bad diagnostics (e.g. bad customer review)? To be specific, start by giving example of P, A, D in your case.


## PAD_components
P, A, and D components can be mapped to business model, scaling tool, and observed market data, respectively. P represents business model, starting from long term planning on orientation and investment to short term control on customer, technology, competition, product, organization. A represents scaling tools that can implement business models. D would be real-world market data, such as customer behavior and sales figures. These components can also be combined into different models in startup operations: P, PD, PA, and PAD. P Models could represent different business strategies. PD Models would combine the business model with real-world market data. PA Models would combine the business model with analytical tools. PAD Models would integrate the business model, scaling tools, and real-world market data. PAD is the ideal destination for a scaling startup but different evolutionary paths exist, so strategies could be dynamically adjusted along one's lifecycle.

### P - Business Model
P in startups could represent the core business model, including elements like product features, market strategy, and organizational structure. For example, a startup in the renewable energy sector might focus on solar panel efficiency, government subsidies, and partnerships with construction firms. A health tech startup's P model may include variables like patient engagement, telehealth features, and partnerships with healthcare providers. SaaS startup might have a P model that includes variables like subscription pricing, feature sets, and target customer demographics.
can be represented in three tier tree format from entrepreneurial strategy, business model feature, product feature. Entrepreneurial strategies are investment (execute or control) and orientation (collaborate or compete) and business model features are technology (length 4 vector), customer (length 4 vector), organization (length 4 vector), competition (length 4 vector).
e.g. of parameter space of organization (with @chasfine) are size, location (geographical - sitting in the office), direct report to ceo (decentralization), percentage of technical degree and college education (what kind of people you hire (mit vs macdonalds)), what is the average compensation relative to industry (investing in your people / churn a lot, turnover, pay more, lower turnover / good or bad job), average turn or tenure, how much money they've been funded, round of funding, gone through ipo? which needs to be segmented into 4.

### A - Scaling Tools
A could represent tools that help refine or approximate the optimal business model. This includes data analytics platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and even decision-making frameworks like SWOT or PESTLE analysis.

### D - Observed Data
D would be the real-world market data that the startup collects. This could include customer behavior, sales figures, and market trends. For instance, a fintech startup might look at user engagement metrics, transaction volumes, and regulatory changes.

## GPS2Navigation
GPS provides the raw data about a location, navigation systems use this data to guide users to their destinations. Diagnostics on Bayesian workflow allows construction of GPS in model space. How can the typifying paths idea (below) be improved to build good navigation system that provides each modeler localized decision support? I‚Äôm curious about relevant literature (e.g. Bayesian workflow casestudies with real data & specific application) that can help me flesh out navigation idea to provide documentation complementing SBC package vignettes e.g. Small model implementation workflow ‚Ä¢ SBC 1. Looking forward to learn from any inconsistencies between our internal world models!

As a modeler explores model space with Bayesian workflow map, which among joint probability p(y,Œ∏) (P), approximator pA(y|Œ∏) (A), data ~y (D) can he/she decide to update in which sequence based on what signal? Definition and example of P, A, D are in @paul.buerkner, @scholz, Stefan Radev‚Äôs paper 5 (which I highly recommend!) and for simplicity I divided this journey into decision node and paths.

Basic idea is a modeler‚Äôs journey is a sequential decision problem where signal at each time is high dimension diagnostics and actions are updating P or A or D. This naturally led to the question: can we typify paths to reach the state of good enough diagnostics? For instance, building on Birthday problem, a time series model for numbers of birth per day, let‚Äôs say a modeler start with a simple slow trend model (P) with optimization approximation algorithm (A) with birthday per day in USA from 1969-1988. After some modeling, he/she retrieved good enough community-recommended diagnostics (prior predictive check, simulation based calibration, posterior predictive check) using a time series model with long term, seasonal, weekly, day of year, and special floating day variation (P‚Äô), Markov chain approximation algorithm (A‚Äô), birthdays per year in USA from 1969-2018. However, there exists at least 20 paths (excluding give-up at each decision) that this modeler could have gone though.

### 3 types of decision

Q1. prior predictive check diagnostics?

bad: update P

good enough: go to step 2

Q2. simulation-based calibration diagnostics?

bad: update P or A

good enough: go to step 3

Q3. posterior predictive check diagnostics?

bad: update P or A or D

good enough: finish

good enough prior predictive check diagnostics (ppc1) := range of simulated observed data based on prior is not extreme: irrejectable.

good enough simulation based calibration (sbc) diagnostics:= ecdf-based plots is within confidence band with alpha for every test quantities (t))

good enough posterior predictive check diagnostics (ppc2) := range of simulated based on posterior is acceptable for every quantities of interest (observed data, utility)

Subjectivity in ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù diagnostics makes this a decision problem. Bars would be high in pharmaceutical and defense industry where human‚Äôs life is at stake. And even in the same industry, company with enough resource (computation, time, human capital) would have higher bars, and even in the same company, bar can be dragged down as project deadline approaches.

### >20 types of path

bad ppc1

1b_P (1): update P to retrieve good enough ppc1 diagnostics

good enough ppc1, bad sbc

1g2b_P, 1g2b_A (2): update P or A to retrieve good enough sbc

1g2b_PA, 1g2b_AP (2): update either P or A gives bad sbc, update P-A or A-P to retrieve good enough sbc

good enough ppc1 and sbc, bad ppc2

1g2g3b_P, 1g2g3b_A, 1g2g3g_D (3): update P or A or D to retrieve good enough ppc2

1g2g3b_PA, 1g2g3b_AP, 1g2g3b_PD, 1g2g3b_DP, 1g2g3b_AD, 1g2g3b_DA (6): bad ppc2 after updating one, retrieve good enough ppc2 after updating two

1g2g3b_PAD, 1g2g3b_PDA, 1g2g3b_ADP, 1g2g3b_APD, 1g2g3b_DAP, 1g2g3b_DPA (6): bad ppc2 even after updating two, retrieve good enough ppc2 after updating all three

[[ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èsampling based hypothesis testing for experiment]]
## 1. Testing Entrepreneurial Hypothesis and Experiment 
<img width="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/937c609f-7710-47e6-8869-e581d301ac43">

Entrepreneurs test hypotheses about value creation and capture from their ideas. However, due to high complexity and dynamics of startup operations, crystallizing hypothesis (what) and experiment (how) are challenging. Rent the Runway's founders Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss were one of the few who tested key value creation hypotheses, in a systematic, rapid, and cost-effective manner. Critical hypothesis of their business were (1) college students and young professionals would find renting previously worn designer gowns superior to purchasing those dresses new, (2) dresses would, in most cases, be returned by customers in an acceptable condition such that after dry cleaning, they could be rented again, and (3) leading designers would not only be amenable to their dresses being rented but also would partner with a young startup to enable this new avenue. Before fully committing to their idea, the founders sought insights from renowned designers, leading them to pivot from working directly with designers to becoming a new distribution channel for them. They also conducted targeted experiments at universities, with the constructive feedback guiding their strategic direction and validating their idea's worth.

With the purpose of supplying testing tools for entrepreneurs, we apply Bayesian workflow (BW) to add structure to entrepreneurs testing. BW introduces how to build statistical model from ground zero, adding inference, and checking/improvement, along with the comparison of diÔ¨Äerent models, not just for the purpose of model choice or model averaging but more importantly to better understand these models. 

 We start by defining optimality measure of experiment $\theta$ and hypothesis $\phi$ testing as:
$\mathcal{O}(\theta, \phi)=\frac{1}{ {ValidApproxBiasCost(\phi)} + {ValidStatBiasCost(\phi, N)}} \times \frac{1}{{VerifApproxBiasCost(\theta|\phi) +  {VerifConvgCost}}(\theta|\phi, M)} \times \frac{1}{{OpportunityCost}(\theta, \phi, N, M)} (1)$

(1) starts from a heuristic measure, Criticality X Fidelity / Opportunity Cost, introduced in 15.911, Entrepreneurial Strategy by Scott Stern. Each components are defined as "how much does the ideal version of this test (measured accurately and at low cost) meaningfully reduce uncertainty surrounding the core value creation and capture hypotheses? (Criticality)",  "Is there a (reasonable cost) test with a reasonable level of accuracy and precision? (Fidelity)",  "What are the resource, time, and strategic costs of an experiment? (How much) is there a tradeoff between faster, better, and cheaper? (Opportunity cost)".  

Connecting this with verification and validation developed in simulation[^1], product management[^2], software development [^3], scientific theory[^4] literature, criticality is validation test asking "are we making the right product?" whereas Fidelity is verification test asking "are we making the product right given that (or sometimes before knowing) we are making the right product?". Optimal testing is characterized with critical hypothesis, high fidelity, low opportunity. Statistical, approximation, optimization bias as three components of inductive bias from machine learning [^5]  literature is a useful framework to capture the tradeoff between the three, which is why we frame hypothesis criticality and fidelity as bias. Entrepreneurs take action to decrease associated cost. Table 1 introduces the definition of the costs.  

To test a pair of experiment and hypothesis, we can use conditional probability $p(\theta, \phi) = p(\phi) p(\theta|\phi)$. In other words, hypothesis $\phi$ and experiment $\theta$ joint distribution is sequentially tested. The first term of (1) is related to pure hypothesis $p(\phi)$ and second  term is related to experiment conditional on hypothesis  $p(\theta|\phi)$. Interpretation is, given that we have set the critical hypothesis for business, how faithful is the experiment to answer the hypothesis? Testing can also happen in $p(\theta) p(\phi|\theta)$ sequence. $p(\phi|\theta)$ means given that we have a faithful experiment to test any hypothesis, what is the critical hypothesis to ask? Both works, but let's focus on a more natural testing procedure, which first nail hypothesis then move on to experiment.

Table 1: Definition of Costs associated with Entrepreneurial Experiment $\theta$ to Test Hypothesis $\phi$

| -                   | def (related concept in E-strategy)                                                                                                                                         |

| ValidStatBiasCost($\theta, N$)   | Cost of statistical bias caused by approximating utility of beachhead customer population with that of N sampled customers |
| VerifApproxBiasCost($\theta$ \| $\phi$) | Cost of approximation bias caused by approximate testing hypothesis $\phi$ with designed experiment $\theta$                 |
| VerifConvgBiasCost($\theta$\| $\phi, M$)  | Cost of optimization bias caused by limited resource (represented as time $M$) early stops experiment $\theta$ to test $\phi$ before reaching to the optimal         |
| OpportunityCost($\theta, \phi, N, M$)     | Resource, time, and strategic costs of an experiment $\theta$ to test hypothesis $\phi$                                                                                                                       |

Table 1 lists costs associated with entrepreneurial experiment $\theta$ to test hypothesis $\phi$. The first component of criticality or validation is ${ValidStatBiasCost(\phi, N)}$. It is from statistical bias caused by approximating utility of beachhead customer population with that of N sampled customers. The second is ${ValidApproxBiasCost(\phi)}$ which is from approximation bias caused by approximating utility with testing hypothesis $\phi$. 

The first component of fidelity or verification is ${VerifApproxBiasCost(\theta|\phi)}$ which is from approximation bias caused by approximate testing hypothesis $\phi$ with experiment $\theta$. The second is ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$ induced from optimization bias.  This is due to limited resource (represented as time $M$) early stops experiment $\theta$ to test $\phi$ before reaching to the optimal. Decomposition of ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$ and ${VerifApproxBiasCost(\theta|\phi)}$ builds on the two distinct phases of iterative simulation: initial mixing of sequences towards the target distribution, often likened to "learning" or information propagation from the model to inferences, and the subsequent movement within that target distribution. Uncertainty of the first phase is epistemic and second is aleatoric. The first phase can represent a current state of knowledge, especially in scenarios where new information is being acquired or when tracking a changing process, while the second phase can be interpreted directly as inherent uncertainty of model parameter or time variability. An example of this is the study of radon gas exposure[^6], where high uncertainty in home radon levels was observed, even conditional on geographic data, and these levels were known to fluctuate over time[^7]. 

${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ is a function of $\theta, \phi$ and is a resource, time, and strategic costs of an experiment $\theta$ to test hypothesis $\phi$. Notice the first two costs are closer to demand side and last three costs are closer to supply side. 

Increasing the N decreases the ${ValidStatBiasCost(\phi, N)}$, but increases ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ capturing the first tradeoff.  Increasing the M decreases the ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$, but increases ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ capturing the second tradeoff.  Less specified hypothesis $\phi$ on customer, technology, organization, competition may increase ${VerifConvgBiasCost(\theta|\phi, M)}$, but generality of the test result may decrease  ${OpportunityCost(\theta, \phi, N, M)}$ capturing the third tradeoff.

### vision and T4
In the context of the Mens, Manus and Machina project, my interests align most closely with T4 Topic1, 2 (learning and improving dynamic human decisions).  My goal is to develop an AI mentor (nss_navigator) that helps guide entrepreneurs to build operations strategies and capabilities that support their chosen business strategies. The intent is to build on the ‚Äúoperations for entrepreneurs‚Äù framework of Fine, et al (2022) which proposes ten tools for scaling entrepreneurial ventures:  how and when to segment, automate, processify, automate, acculturate, professionalize, collaborate, platformize, capitalize, and evaluate. Furthermore, this framework encourages entrepreneurs to continuously test the business and operations model by providing smart and scalable hypothesis testing in an experimental design framework. ultimately, the goal is to create a ‚Äúsmart assistant‚Äù that can emulate a mentor's insights and democratize consulting. Below, I will elaborate how this vision and choice (entrepreneurs and AI mentor) can fit into and be supported by T4.

### customer: entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs have a critical role to play in economic development. (See, e.g.,  Roberts & Eesley, 2011; Eesley & Miller, 2018). Generative AI has catalyzed the blossoming of many AI startups, and many more will likely be created in the coming years.  Additionally, many more entrepreneurs will be affected by AI, as a tool to help them, or sometimes as a tool that puts them out of business, if they are not sufficiently nimble and clever. A large fraction of all startup  companies fails, yet there is also evidence that more experienced and mature entrepreneurs probabilistically have greater success.  Work at the MIT Sloan School by several entrepreneurship scholars/educators, including Charlie Fine (my advisor) on Nail, Scale, Sail framework on operations for entrepreneurs), Scott Stern on entrepreneurial strategy, Bill Aulet on disciplined entrepreneurship and tactics, seeks to codify some of the knowledge that may help entrepreneurs improve their likelihood of success. Admittedly, the decision space for entrepreneurs is large and complex. However, we believe that there are many case examples of successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurial ventures that can support a database to help us codify the knowledge we seek.

### technology: AI mentor
Based on (1) my practical experience of founding a startup that supplies demand forecasts and inventory optimization support for small businesses, (2) my theoretical preference of pre-asymptotic to asymptotic, instability/disequilibrium to stability/equilibrium, tools to reach normative to analysis from normative, growth diagnostics to growth theory; and (3) my interactions this summer with practitioners and scholars in entrepreneurship, I identified three areas to focus on:   (1)  pitfall modes describing existing problems (I felt or observed), (2a and 2 b) as-is  practice and academic approaches to these problems, and  (3) to-be options for direction of improvement. Our plan is to deploy generative AI to open up new avenues of research to speed the development of our codification of the knowledge most needed by entrepreneurs.

### organization
Other than ongoing communication on the above ideas with Charlie, Scott, Jinhua, and Sandy, I submitted nss_navigator to [MIT ignite](https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/mit-ignite/) (generative AI entrepreneurship competition) to get feedback. Also, I'm proactively reaching out to Singapore networks to ask for support: 
1.  Yanling Liu from Changi Airport Group (Sloan fellow). She offered support in applying the theory we learn in the class we're taking together (15.911 entrepreneurial strategy) using her experience and ongoing projects in Changi airport operations e.g. self-service check-in, biometric measures, using AV to transport baggage). 
2. Pengfei Chen from the Singapore Economic Development Board (Sloan fellow) can help analyze ventures in growth industries targeted by EDB and to distribute nss_navigator.
3. YoungGun Song(Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center in Singapore) can help Charlie and Angie visit local factory and we can discuss innovation strategies for established companies. Also we can learn auto-tech entrepreneur ecosystem in Singapore.
4. Howard Califano (Singapore Innovation Center) can possibly provide data and insights on local startups. 
5. Prof. Hahn Jungpil, Vice Dean at NUS. He could advise on AI governance perspectives. 
6. Prof.Moon Seung Ki from NUS Engineering. He could provide a technical perspective. Robert Fu, CEO of CellWave Technologies (SMART Catalyst¬¨¬¨). We can interview him to learn his entrepreneurial decisions and ask for some connection to other members of SMART ecosystem.

ORANGE: Brian, Angie
takeaway: 
1. need: features that affect ai mentor's tone (prescriptive vs propositional) and interview strategy to nail it
2. sol: expert system + ways to ask rhetorical questions (questions from the depth of that interaction e.g. shallow is target large or small audience VS what types of customers )

- start to interview from need (novice entrepreneurs), not the solution (mentors)
- mentor:= reflexive, consider what answer might be  VS advisor:= give you answer VS  vcs (sometimes board members) are more biased; have their own agenda
- better to critique rather than suggest i.e. co-develop (push back; not "no that's wrong", help me understand what I should do); we want flashlight, not laser
- similar to private company having more aggressive goals (and test quantities) than academia?

- posterior is latent space (inference)
- informative computer models  entrep. make
- pomdp (model of situation; latent state of the world, prob. of next utility)
- utility (goals in mind) - 100 when in goal; reward (sparse feedback)
- particle (current latent state of the world) - plannning (astar)
- particle filter keep track (every moment choosing an action)
- choicemap is datatype, depth msr of wall (p is the position of robot, take depth msr and compute prob distr of ; noisy)
- pomdp (or); inference (writing model) - robostics

Left applies inductive bias classification (approximation, statistical, optimization) to product development / entrepreneurial operation
Right explains how different entrepreneur profiles with different ownership (atom-supply, bit-supply, customer, demand) are formed from unfair advantage, then how it generates entrepreneurial path

I came by [this](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/presentations/parameterizationtalk.pdf) slide of Andrew which lists his examples of computation (implementation) affecting statistical model (concept) i.e. hand affecting mind as we've discussed. More excitingly üòÜ, past Andrew seemed to support my analogy between sampling algorithms and startup operations (p.59) which Vikash also agreed so I elaborated in https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/174#discussioncomment-7922743.

1. Universe, Ticker, Daily Updates, Weekly Updates, EBITDA, EBIT, Market Cap, Company Size [Ticker, EBITDA, EBIT, Market Cap] are mostly for post-IPO companies. These are not available for startups.
"Universe" could be M&A, Debt Financed, Venture Capital, etc, a joint list of financing status.
"Daily Updates" and "Weekly Updates" are subscription means for users of Pitchbook. If I sign up for daily updates, I will receive daily scraped news about this company.
"Company Size" is employee #.

2. difference btw [First Financing Valuation] and [First Financing Valuation Status]?
"First Financing Valuation" is ; "First Financing Valuation Status" can be Complete, In Progress, etc.

3. difference btw Last Financing Size and Last Financing Size Status?
Same as above.

4. Nothing special about status, just the real-time update of what round of financing a firm is at. If succeeded, all will be "Complete".

- Research on benchmarking (across industry) simulation tool (BST) is useful for biotech and semiconductor startups.

- Startups using BST will increase the demand and expected order rate of BST. Charlie Fine, Charlie Cooney, SMART's help on increasing `customer_adjustment_fraction2` can make this faster.

- Higher expected order rate of BST will incrase expected order rate of Bayes entrepreneurship academic field (BEAF). Scott Stern's help on increasing `need_adjustment_fraction1` can make this faster. Both increased expected order rate of BST and BEAF will increase desired production of BEAF.

- Higher expected order rate of BEAF will increase desired production of solution-based science.


Q1. what is the highest uncertainty?
Q2. how should I allocate energy between 
- push solution/tech :`solution adjustment fraction [2,1] `, `tech adjustemtn push fraction [1,2]` 
- pull need/customer: `customer adjment fraction2`, `need adjustment fraction1`
- fulfill: `fulfill adjustment fraction1`

Three chat snippet with Kris Ferreira on operations to nail and scale visionary research 

### empirical TOM seminar under NSS lens (Jan.22.2024)
nail stage
- test desirability and technical feasibility of our research question
- iterate between phenomena, theory, measurement to nail our value proposition that satisfies us, customer (paper reader or our future students), investor (advisor)

scale stage
- test operational feasibility and viability of our research before investing significant time and energy 
- collaborate with equipment providers (data and tool providers), sampled customers (trusted colleagues and faculty), investor (referee), using and to develop our profession
- segment customer and set beachhead (research outlet's audience)
- build community both from supply and demand side and acculturate our vision, share progress in the language of aligned evaluation metric

sail stage
- processify the above that helps us automate, replicate, platformize, capitalize the knowledge creation itself

### different structure of solo vs collaborator/empirical research (Feb.16.2024)
- precision of inferring desirability (tigher prior) is higher with more concrete product (research proposal)

### identifying core capability (Feb.16.2024)
- pure bits: social science research
- mix (increasing atomness): biotech, semiconductor
- pure atoms: construction domain startups (e.g. eco-brick, [unity homes](https://unityhomes.com/))

I love the way you are framing our research progress in the NSS way from a startup development perspective! Even tho we are still at nail stage, I feel we can iterate fast enough (fail fast too!) to lock a research question that is both valuable to us!!

i thought matt's theory could benefit from Sterman's WIDGETS (left [WIDGETS.MDL.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16193874/WIDGETS.MDL.zip)) WIDGETSW (right [WIDGETSW.MDL.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16193876/WIDGETSW.MDL.zip)) models

<img width="1321" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee1211e9-86f3-45a9-bc5b-e23083971d4d">

<img width="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24cbb314-8f13-43d4-bb5f-050410f15e7a">

## ask matt 
1. whether we'd need WIDGETS or WIDGETSW i.e. key difference is backlog stock in order fulfillment loop - what's backlog in matt's knowledge production chain?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ec3541-58e5-4b5b-8d6e-21be0b8aed37)

2. i think when knowledge (science) is an agent, empirical work and unit theory stock are sequential, but if knowledge producer is an agent, existing theory and empirics can be parallel i.e. mapping the two work with the goal of maximizing its application. this is the need-solution pairing model i shared previously in https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/190#discussioncomment-8672261

3. can we connect paradigm shift with entrepreneurial persuasion (which has root in contrarian dynamics) based on existing literature

3.1 SD view: [sterman-wittenberg-1999-path-dependence-competition-and-succession-in-the-dynamics-of-scientific-revolution.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16194232/sterman-wittenberg-1999-path-dependence-competition-and-succession-in-the-dynamics-of-scientific-revolution.pdf)

3.2 Bayesian entrepreneurship view: [4 Persuasion and Choice.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16194101/4.Persuasion.and.Choice.zip) from #234 

4. by "persuasion", to analogize science as elephant and scientist as blinds, this is saying what matters more is giving like-minded blinds utility by sharing theory or observation matters, rather than existing elephant) people u not sequential (as I've shown previously in

| SS | Work in Process Inventory = INTEG(Production Start Rate - Production Rate, Desired WIP) | Unit theories = INTEG(building - integration - comparison, Desired Unit theories) |
| S | Inventory = INTEG(Production Rate - Shipment Rate, Desired Inventory) | Programmatic Theories = INTEG(integration - redundancy, Desired Programmatic theories) |
| preparing | Production Rate = DELAY3(Production Start Rate, Manufacturing Cycle Time) | integration = DELAY3(building, Time to Integrate) |
| pping | Production Start Rate = MAX(0, Desired Production Start Rate) | building = MAX(0, Desired building) |

| DS | Desired Inventory = Desired Inventory Coverage * Expected Order Rate | Desired Programmatic theories = Desired Knowledge Coverage * Expected Research Questions |
| DSS | Desired WIP = Manufacturing Cycle Time * Desired Production | Desired Unit theories = Time to Integrate * Desired building |
| max delivering | Maximum Shipment Rate = Inventory / Minimum Order Processing Time | Maximum application = Programmatic Theories / Minimum Knowledge Processing Time |
| dping | Desired Production = MAX(0, Expected Order Rate + Adjustment from Inventory) | Desired building = MAX(0, Expected Research Questions + Adjustment from Programmatic Theories) |
| dpping | Desired Production Start Rate = Desired Production + Adjustment for WIP | Desired building = Desired building + Adjustment for Unit theories |
| adj s | Adjustment from Inventory = (Desired Inventory - Inventory) / Inventory Adjustment Time | Adjustment from Programmatic Theories = (Desired Programmatic theories - Programmatic Theories) / Knowledge Adjustment Time |
| adj ss | Adjustment for WIP = (Desired WIP - Work in Process Inventory) / WIP Adjustment Time | Adjustment for Unit theories = (Desired Unit theories - Unit theories) / Theory Adjustment Time |
| desired delivering | Desired Shipment Rate = Backlog / Target Delivery Delay | Desired application = Supported hypotheses / Target Knowledge Delay |
| EOR | Expected Order Rate = INTEG(Change in Exp Orders, Customer Order Rate) | Expected Research Questions = INTEG(Change in Exp Questions, Initial Research Questions) |

| INITIAL TIME | INITIAL TIME = 0 | INITIAL TIME = 0 |
| SAVEPER | SAVEPER = TIME STEP | SAVEPER = TIME STEP |
| TIME STEP | TIME STEP = 0.125 | TIME STEP = 0.125 |

Key concepts from Figure 1 in the attached document:
1. The knowledge production system focuses on the relationship between unit theories and programmatic theories.
6. Unit theories are built from supported hypotheses and can be integrated into programmatic theories.
7. Programmatic theories guide the development of research questions and influence the application of knowledge to management practice and education.
8. The system includes feedback loops, such as how the current stock of programmatic theories limits new research questions.
9. Novelty plays a role in balancing the system to prevent bloating of programmatic theories with obvious relationships.
10. The model emphasizes the importance of integration and coherence in programmatic theory development.

I wonder what form it would be if we decide to embed automation evaluation (like the table introduced in https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/scaling-automation-two-proven-paths-to-success/ article) in orbit platform.

Below is an example of the kind of scorecard used to rate opportunities for automation across multiple dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5 (low to high impact or opportunity), or with actual figures where appropriate (hard savings, hours, etc.). Leaders review scorecards to identify tasks that are good candidates for automation. Different organizations will weigh the various factors differently.

| Automation Fit |  | Level of Effort |  | Value Created |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| FEATURE | SCORE | FEATURE | SCORE | FEATURE | SCORE |
| Consistency of core <br> process |  | Development hours |  | Hours saved |  |
| Documentation of <br> use case |  | Development cost |  | Hard savings |  |
| Complexity of use <br> case |  | Development <br> runtime |  | Revenue gained |  |
| Level of discretion <br> and expertise <br> required |  | Complexity of <br> business processes |  | Risk mitigation |  |
| Homogeneity of <br> underlying data <br> sources |  | Exceptions to core <br> roles |  | Additional value <br> levers (job <br> quality, customer <br> satisfaction) |  |

my üí†diamond model (two by two supply and demand matching) is an internal üß≠compass for startups.
I'm making different case studies and asking for evaluation from experts, focusing on experiment/prototype stage: strategy, operations etc.

### quantum computing x diamond model
The key idea is that quantum computing has the potential to significantly accelerate and enhance the drug discovery process by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations of molecular systems. This could impact the pivoting decisions made by pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups. I interpreted my hypotheses R1, R3, and R4 in quantum computing for drug discovery  context:

R1: With quantum computing, there may be a higher signal in product pivoting (i.e., changing the molecule, strength, or dosage form) compared to market pivoting (i.e., changing the target disease or population). This is because quantum computers are particularly well-suited for simulating chemical systems and could provide more accurate insights into how changes in the molecule or formulation affect its efficacy and safety. This could lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio.

R3: The noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, which is the current state of quantum computing, is characterized by noisy and error-prone qubits. In this context, œÉ (the noisiness of the data) is high. As quantum computers become more reliable and move towards fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), œÉ will decrease. A higher œÉ in the NISQ era may lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio, as companies may focus more on optimizing the molecule and formulation to compensate for the noisy data.

R4: Larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources may have a larger k (the cost threshold for pivoting) compared to smaller biotech startups. With the advent of quantum computing, the cost of pivoting the product (i.e., running quantum simulations to optimize the molecule and formulation) may decrease relative to the cost of pivoting the market (i.e., conducting clinical trials in a new disease area or population). This could lead to a higher pivot product-over-market ratio, especially for larger organizations.

Additionally, quantum computing could impact the four key questions mentioned:

1. For a given target/disease, quantum computers could help identify the optimal molecule, strength, and dosage form more efficiently by enabling more accurate simulations of the molecular systems.

2. For a given molecule, quantum computers could help predict the most promising disease indications and patient populations by simulating the molecule's interactions with various biological targets.

3. Quantum computers could assist in deciding whether to continue, stop, or pivot an in-house drug discovery program by providing more accurate and timely data on the molecule's potential efficacy and safety.

4. When considering whether to buy or not buy an external drug candidate, quantum computers could help assess the candidate's potential more accurately, informing the decision to acquire the asset and potentially stop internal programs in the same area.

In summary, quantum computing has the potential to significantly impact the pivoting decisions and strategies in drug discovery by providing more accurate and efficient simulations of molecular systems. This could lead to a higher product-to-market pivot ratio, especially in the NISQ era and for larger pharmaceutical companies.

erin scott was interested in below, asking me to share saying she'd think more about it and i shared with explaining main motivation is from [decomposition of inductive bias](https://0599faed.streaklinks.com/CF4vmBJCQlL25oP-NwX-uhZU/https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FbIZB1hIJ4u8%3Fsi%3DKP3uRtpcw2NYyb0y%26t%3D395).

1) statistical error (difference between having infinite - finite samples)
2) approximation error (difference between having infite vs finite function space)
3) optimization error (difference between having convex - nonconvex function and hypothesis space)
+ reference error (I added the fourth component reference error based on gans et al's "competition" element). i wonder how this may be relevant with [computational reducibility](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputationalReducibility.html) i.e. opportunity where there exist a market one can serve better than its identified competitor (defined as firm that provides a similar product or service (or otherwise solves the same or similar customer need) to a startup‚Äôs chosen customer)

an machine learning example for using neural network. you'd need to 
- increase layers of neural network to decrease `approximation error` (same effect of increasing function space)
- increase sample size to decrease `statistical error` (same effect of increasing hypothesis space)
- increase time to run optimization algorithm till it converge to decrease `optimization error`
- not sure how to decrease reference error
 statistical error (expectation into finite samples), approximation error (finite function space), optimization error (distance from global optimal - due to nonconvexity)

related to this, i typified five uncertainties from chintan's thesis to create uncertainty-opportunity-learning mapping.
## agent
### value create

- technological uncertainty arises from inherent architectural differences across different technologies that lead to inherently different ability to attain quality levels, innovation levels, and cost structures. Technology is the tools, techniques, designs and knowledge used by a business to create practical value for consumers.

- customer uncertainty?? Customer is any person, group or organization who will pay the startup money for any of its goods or services.

- market uncertainty arises from the actions of firms and consumers. On the supply side, firm‚Äôs decision to affect switching costs and network effect, or to integrate/modularize introduces uncertainty. On the demand side, the consumers‚Äô preference for quality, innovation, price, and compatibility introduces the uncertainty.

### value capture 
- organizational uncertainty arises because of how agile or sluggish a firm may be in allocating resources to quality vs. innovation. In a single industry, modular industry structure makes firms more agile than when the industry structure is integrated. But across different industries, firms may be more or less agile depending upon the nature of product or service at hand.  Organization of a startup is its initial choice of capabilities it will nurture and resources that it will draw upon that are determined by the entrepreneur‚Äôs initial team and culture. Building organizations enables delivering value creation and capture; turning their vision into reality. The 

- competition uncertainty ?? Competitor is a firm that provides a similar product or service (or otherwise solves the same or similar customer need) to a startup‚Äôs chosen customer.

### value deliver

## environment
- regulatory uncertainty arises because firms are uncertain about the regulatory action. In the previous chapter, we discussed the scope and timing related uncertainty. In this chapter, we will study the impact of antitrust regulation, which more directly affects the resulting industry structure. 

- industry uncertainty arises from the actions of firms, regulators, and the nature of technology. Factors such as technological architecture‚Äôs influence on firm‚Äôs ability to integrate or modularize, or antitrust regulation‚Äôs influence on firm‚Äôs accumulation of market power introduces variation in the rate at which the industry structure becomes integral or modular.

## 1. experiment design with bayesian workflow and low vs high bar 
- [Bayesian Workflow and Startup Operations](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/159#discussioncomment-7033951) and gps2navigation 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd45bc59-7d12-47c0-90f3-3a1f5799c7a7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea6bdb3-d24a-4e9f-ae37-733026ffd23d)

low and high bar theory is applied to my situation in https://github.com/Data4DM/Tool4Ops4Entrep/issues/21#issue-2360360735

### Entrepreneurial experiments and their success measures.

- conducting low BAR experiments in entrepreneurship is important, which are easy to pass and provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn't.

- people often understand how to interpret low BAR experiments differently than high BAR experiments, with low BAR experiments providing affirmation and high BAR experiments providing the truth.

- importance of experimentation in product development, highlighting the value of minimal viable products (MVPs) in reducing false positives and startups.

- the concept of "high BAR" experiments, which require minimal effort and provide valuable insights into customer preferences. (??)

### Optimizing experiments for entrepreneurs.

- Entrepreneurs prioritize low-bar experiments over high-bar experiments, despite potential biases.

- Speaker discusses the use of noise in decision-making, with a focus on the Bayesian approach. (??)

### Entrepreneurial optimism and experimentation.

- Entrepreneurs choose high bar experiments to convince investors, as they are more optimistic and want to maximize upside potential.

- Minimum Viable experiments are valuable for businesses and investors, as they provide convincing evidence and demonstrate potential for growth.

- Entrepreneurs' optimism influences likelihood of starting a venture, with lower probability of success for those who need to persuade others.

- Pioneer of experiments on unbiased data to gain insights, but challenges remain in interpreting results and understanding data-generating process.

**Summary of the Three Scott's Points:** from [experiment strategy conference](https://otter.ai/u/4fG5h9whQpy13i1kAomL-0_wFw0?utm_source=copy_url  ) which led to development of #249 

1. **Different Experiments for Self-Persuasion vs. Persuading Others:**
   - In a **contested environment** where beliefs and incentives differ, the experiments an entrepreneur conducts to convince themselves about their idea are fundamentally different from those aimed at persuading others.
   - Entrepreneurs are often **contrarian optimists**, using experiments to validate their own beliefs rather than to convince neutral or skeptical parties.
   - This creates a **profound tension** in optimal design because what convinces oneself may not be sufficient to persuade others.
   - The concept of **agency** is crucial here, as highlighted in the Bayesian entrepreneurship framework, emphasizing how personal beliefs shape experimental approaches.

2. **Disagreement vs. Incentive Misalignment in Optimal Design:**
   - The area of designing optimal strategies in environments where there is **belief disagreement** or differing incentives is vast and not well-understood.
   - When parties **disagree**, the challenge is to create designs that can bridge differing beliefs.
   - If the issue is **incentive misalignment**, the focus shifts to aligning interests to achieve mutual goals.
   - Understanding whether the core issue is **disagreement** or **incentive divergence** is essential for effective design in contested environments.

3. **Alignment of Contrarian Beliefs Leads to Investment:**
   - Entrepreneurs don't need to convince the **average investor**; instead, they seek investors who share their **contrarian optimism**.
   - The venture capital model, organized around equity, allows for efficient **sorting** between optimistic entrepreneurs and like-minded investors.
   - When an investor shares the entrepreneur's vision of **unlimited upside potential**, despite widespread skepticism, this alignment leads to investment.
   - This principle also applies to attracting **employees and partners** who are willing to commit because they share the same optimistic beliefs.

**Connecting to the Central Statement:**

The overarching theme across these points is the challenge of designing optimal strategies in a **contested environment**, where differing beliefs and incentives require careful consideration. Understanding whether the differences stem from **disagreement** or **incentive misalignment** is crucial for tailoring approaches that can effectively navigate these complexities. The alignment of beliefs, especially in entrepreneurial contexts, plays a significant role in forming successful collaborations and investments despite the contested nature of the environment.

#243 is prototype that competes human and near-optimal bayes - it's goal is to 
1. show belief update visually
2. enhance human's belief on machine though improved thought product

@mugamma was looking for bayes-net based causal logic structure 
- [todd zenger's slide](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16649003/2a.What.is.Bayesian.Entrepreneurship.-.Zenger.BEC.2024.pdf) mentions griffiths and tenenbaum's research on causal induction from small samples (i don't understand why todd is framing "bayes net to causal theory" - isn't bayesian workflow (inference, model checking, extension) with bayes net model, what causal model is?)

to gain insights on enhancing game environments for `pivot-game` developed in #243 , I played Bocconi univ.'s [theory building games](https://imsl.unibocconi.it/play/). arnaldo shared his hope to add multi-armed bandit (which was suggested in chat with @mugamma) and graphical belief representation which i feel prob.prog. can contribute (arnaldo said he'd discuss with scott on ways mit and bocconi team can collaborate)

JB who has expertise on porsche helped me play porshce theory building game -  @jeanbaptiste may i ask for your input on below four probabilities - reason we couldn't proceed the game was because we further need to set probability on the edge:

This fundamentally challenges traditional economic models requiring shared priors. The group's research agenda aims to establish a cognitive/behavioral framework linking opportunity selection, learning/experimentation, and decision-making processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The key insight from Van den Steen's work is that "there's nothing about being overconfident about what you're doing in life that makes you irrational" - apparent overconfidence can emerge naturally from rational decision-making when people have different prior beliefs. Entrepreneurs aren't inherently irrational; they select into opportunities where they have more optimistic assessments than others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Entrepreneurs with optimistic priors (predisposed to launch) design "high bar" experiments that eliminate false negatives, while skeptics design "low bar" experiments that eliminate false positives. This explains patterns in entrepreneurial experimentation like "best foot forward" vs. minimum viable products, and has implications for investment decisions during market cycles.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Early-stage entrepreneurs have "mushy" mental models with unclear states and actions, which become more calibrated over time. This process involves navigating trade-offs between precision of probability judgments, theorizing costs, and utility estimation. Resource-rational frameworks can help explain how entrepreneurs make decisions under cognitive constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They diverge in novel situations, when shaped by different life experiences, when facing complex causal structures, and with limited feedback - all characteristics of entrepreneurship. This explains why rational entrepreneurs can maintain different beliefs even when exposed to the same information. Josh's work on intuitive game theory shows how humans evaluate new systems of rules and rewards (analogous to new ventures) based on depth-limited search with general game-based features.                                                    |

Two exemplary models were presented: Jovanovic's industry entry/exit model where firms learn about their efficiency through market feedback, and Mohadeseh Najafi's model of mentorship in startup accelerators. The latter shows how mentors update their beliefs about startup quality through direct observation (2.8%) and information sharing (71%), revealing high information transparency in mentor networks. Structural approaches help quantify previously unmeasured phenomena like the value of mentorship, showing strategic guidance significantly impacts startup quality and funding outcomes. |
