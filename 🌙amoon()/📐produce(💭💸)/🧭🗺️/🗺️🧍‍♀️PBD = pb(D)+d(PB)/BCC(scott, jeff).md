Comparison of Endogenous Choice Treatment

| Dimension                      | Gans & Stern (2017)                                                                                                     | Mackey & Dotson (2024)                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus**              | Theoretical model of endogenous strategy choice between control and execution                                           | Methodological approach to properly estimate endogenous choices                                                        |
| **Type of Choice**             | Binary choice between control (IP protection) vs execution (speed to market)                                            | General strategic choices (can handle multiple choices)                                                                |
| **Treatment of Heterogeneity** | Models firm heterogeneity in capabilities and market conditions that influence strategy choice                          | Emphasizes statistical modeling of firm-level heterogeneity through hierarchical Bayesian models                       |
| **Assumptions about Choice**   | Choices are made rationally based on expected returns                                                                   | Choices are deliberate but can accommodate both rational and behavioral factors                                        |
| **Time Dimension**             | Dynamic model considering both immediate and future payoffs                                                             | Can handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data structures                                                       |
| **Treatment of Uncertainty**   | Explicit modeling of uncertainty in innovation outcomes                                                                 | Can incorporate uncertainty through prior distributions and model structure                                            |
| **Key Mechanisms**             | - Trade-off between control and speed to market<br>- Learning from early market entry<br>- Protection through IP rights | - Hierarchical structure for firm differences<br>- Joint modeling of choice and outcome<br>- Flexible error structures |
| **Empirical Implications**     | Predicts patterns in strategy choice based on firm and market characteristics                                           | Provides tools to estimate these patterns while accounting for endogeneity                                             |
| **Limitations**                | - Simplified binary choice structure<br>- Assumes rational optimization                                                 | - Computational complexity<br>- Requires specification of priors                                                       |
| **Core Innovation**            | Shows how appropriability regime is endogenously chosen                                                                 | Shows how to properly estimate models with endogenous choices                                                          |
| **View of Firm Strategy**      | Strategy is chosen to optimize expected returns given firm capabilities                                                 | Strategy choice can be modeled as part of a broader system of decisions                                                |
| **Treatment of Causality**     | Clear theoretical causal mechanisms                                                                                     | Provides tools to estimate causal effects with endogenous choices                                                      |

*Note: While these papers take different approaches, they are highly complementary. Gans & Stern provide the theoretical framework for understanding why and how choices are endogenous, while Mackey & Dotson provide the statistical tools to properly analyze such choices empirically.
