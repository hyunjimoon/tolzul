Now each aspect has a single, carefully chosen emoji that best represents its core concept:
- 🎯 : Targeting success in risk management
- 🧩 : Individual piece of larger portfolio
- 💰 : Financial compensation
- 🤝 : Shared interests and collaboration
- 🛡️ : Protection through diversification
- 🔍 : Market testing and discovery
- 💵 : Financial structure
- ⏱️ : Time element
- 📢 : Information spread
- 📈 : Return patterns

This makes the table cleaner and helps focus attention while still maintaining visual memory aids.
The table now shows that while the fundamental principles of risk management and reward distribution are remarkably similar (✓), the main differences (≠) lie in:
1. Time horizons for value realization
2. Capital structure and investment patterns
3. Speed of market feedback and information flow
4. Process of market discovery and validation

This suggests that Hollywood pioneered many of the risk management techniques that VCs later adopted, but adapted them to different time scales and market dynamics.

"back-end points" system in Hollywood is particularly interesting as it represents an early version of modern equity-based compensation, where participants share in both the risk and potential upside of projects. This system, like modern startup equity, aims to align incentives between creators/founders and investors while managing risk through portfolio diversification.
