### 1 Introduction

Entrepreneurial strategy often grapples with the tension between careful planning and decisive action, a dichotomy that manifests in various forms across the literature. This tension can be understood through the lens of computational rationality (Gershman et al., 2015), which provides a unifying framework for understanding intelligence in minds, brains, and machines. At its core, computational rationality posits that intelligent agents seek to maximize expected utility while considering the costs of computation itself.

In the context of entrepreneurship, this framework allows us to view the optimization-action dichotomy as a problem of resource allocation under uncertainty. Entrepreneurs, like other intelligent agents, must make decisions about how to allocate limited cognitive and time resources between planning (optimization) and action, all while operating in highly uncertain environments. To bridge the gap, our research introduces Conversational Inference, an approach that enables faster iteration between optimization and action using translation from natural language to probabilistic program on which further probabilistic inference and optimization happens. It between optimization and action by framing optimization as a sequence of targeted actions converging towards an optimal payoff distribution. This approach can be understood through Marr‚Äôs three levels of analysis (Marr, 2010; Krafft and GriÔ¨Äiths, 2018). At the computational level, we define the goal as maximizing expected payoff for both founders and investors. At the algorithmic level, we represent the process of reaching this goal through negotiation and information exchange. At the implementation level, we consider the role of cognitive biases, communication strategies, and contextual factors. We view founders and investors as resource rational agents with computational minds, designing a decision support system that enables counterfactual reasoning (e.g., ‚ÄùWhat if we raised at a higher valuation?‚Äù), scenario planning (e.g., modeling different market conditions), and strategic choice testing (e.g., comparing different term sheet structures). Fig.1 shows the top two levels this paper will focus on to connect optimization and action. Based on this, design of implementation level will be addressed in sec.3.3 Figure 1: Compuation and algorithimc levels in sec.3.1, sec.3.2

To illustrate our approach, we focus on entrepreneurs‚Äô capitalization operations (Fine et al., 2022), where beliefs about the world models of founders and investors can be quantitatively inferred and represented in a financial value system (Ying et al., 2024). This focus provides a rapidly evolving environment, akin to the role of fruit flies in genetic research (Fine, 2000), allowing us to observe and analyze entrepreneurial decision-making in accelerated timeframes.

Our contributions include:

‚Ä¢ A unified framework that connects abstract optimization goals with concrete, iterative actions in uncertain environments, grounded in computational rationality.

‚Ä¢ The introduction of Conversational Inference as a novel approach to modeling founderinvestor interactions, incorporating principles of approximate Bayesian inference.

‚Ä¢ A model of entrepreneurial learning that accounts for the computational tradeoffs in sequential decision-making.

‚Ä¢ Insights on how principles derived from startup capitalization can be applied to other critical operations, such as market segmentation and process automation.

Our research focuses on entrepreneurs‚Äô capitalization operations as a starting point for several compelling reasons. Much like how fruit flies have become indispensable in genetic research due to their rapid life cycles and ease of manipulation (Fine, 2000), capitalization operations in startups offer a rapidly evolving environment that allows us to observe and analyze entrepreneurial decision-making in accelerated timeframes. The fast-paced nature of startup financing, with its frequent rounds of negotiation, valuation, and strategic pivots, provides a rich, dynamic context for studying the interplay between optimization and action. Moreover, capitalization decisions directly impact the financial value system of the startup, offering quantifiable outcomes that can be measured and analyzed rigorously. This approach is reminiscent of seminal discoveries in innovation research that emerged from studying the semiconductor industry (Christensen, 2015). By focusing on capitalize action to optimize term-investor fit, we can identify principles of entrepreneurial decision-making that can be applied more broadly to other operational contexts like segment action to optimize product-market fit, automate action to optimize machine-entrepreneur fit. Our study of capitalization operations serves as a microcosm for understanding how entrepreneurs optimize for term-investor fit, with insights that can be extended to other critical areas such as product-market fit in segment operations and program-entrepreneur fit in automation operations. In essence, capitalization provides us with a ‚Äôfruit fly model‚Äô for entrepreneurial strategy, allowing us to uncover fundamental principles that can illuminate the broader landscape of entrepreneurial decision-making.

### 2 Literature Review

The tension between planning and action in entrepreneurial strategy is reflected in several dichotomies in the literature, which can be reinterpreted through the lens of computational rationality:

#### 2.1 Dichotomy in Entrepreneurship: Theory vs Practice-driven, Optimization vs Act, Control vs Execute

Entrepreneurial strategy encompasses several interrelated dichotomies that can be understood through the lens of computational rationality. Theory-driven approaches, as described by Felin and Zenger (2017), emphasize the development and testing of theories about the entrepreneurial environment, aligning with model-based decision-making systems that use rich environmental models to form plans (Gershman et al., 2015). In contrast, practice-driven approaches focus on discovering workable strategies through practical experimentation (Bhide, 2000), resembling model-free systems that rely on cached values from experience. This dichotomy extends to the optimization versus action debate, where the optimization perspective, rooted in classical competitive strategy (Porter, 1980), emphasizes careful analysis and planning, while actionoriented approaches, such as the lean startup methodology (Ries, 2011), prioritize learning through incremental experimentation. Computational rationality reconciles these approaches by framing them as different solutions to maximizing expected utility under computational constraints (Gershman et al., 2015; Russell and Wefald, 1991). The control versus execute dichotomy further illustrates this tension, with control strategies emphasizing formal intellectual property rights (Teece, 1986), and execution strategies prioritizing first-mover advantages and dynamic market engagement (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988). These approaches reflect different strategies for managing uncertainty and computational complexity in entrepreneurial decision-making (Horvitz et al., 1989). Recent work by Chavda et al. (2023) suggests that these dichotomies can be understood as variations in entrepreneurial mindset, with theorybased entrepreneurs more likely to engage in non-monotonic search strategies and value expert opinions for their ability to reveal true distributions of strategy outcomes. This perspective aligns with the broader view of entrepreneurship as a process of theory refinement and testing (Camuffo et al., 2020; Ehrig and Schmidt, 2022), where entrepreneurs navigate the tension between optimization and action through a cycle of belief formation, experimentation, and learning (Agarwal et al., 2024; Felin et al., 2023).

#### 2.2 Machine Learning to Entrepreneurial Learning

Machine learning approaches, particularly Bayesian and Evolutionary methods, offer valuable frameworks for understanding the tension between action and optimization in entrepreneurship. Bayesian methods, grounded in statistical reasoning and probabilistic inference (Pearl, 2009; Jordan et al., 1999), align with optimization-focused strategies, excelling at handling uncertainty and making decisions under probabilistic conditions. These methods can model the process of belief updating and hypothesis testing in entrepreneurial decision-making (Camuffo et al., 2020), mirroring the approach of entrepreneurs who emphasize careful analysis and planning.

Conversely, Evolutionary methods, inspired by biological evolution (Holland, 1992), resonate with action-oriented entrepreneurial approaches. These methods excel at discovering structure in complex systems and optimizing solutions through simulated evolution, paralleling strategies that prioritize learning through experimentation and adaptation (Ries, 2011). The evolutionary perspective illuminates how entrepreneurs adapt and innovate in dynamic market environments (Aldrich and Ruef, 2006).

Recent work, such as the ‚Äùtheory-based view‚Äù (Felin and Zenger, 2017), suggests that successful entrepreneurial strategies might involve a blend of both approaches. This aligns with our prototype toolbox for startup pivoting, which employs a cognitive system‚Äôs multi-level framework to reconcile the tension between action and optimization. By modeling founders and investors as resource-rational agents, we can interpret inference-based proposals as actions, viewing negotiations as a convergence process toward optimal solutions.

This synthesis of Bayesian decision theory, evolutionary thinking, and computational rationality (Gershman et al., 2015) provides a unifying perspective. It allows us to view both approaches as strategies for maximizing expected utility under computational constraints (Russell and Wefald, 1991), facilitating counterfactual reasoning, scenario planning, and strategic choice testing in uncertain entrepreneurial environments.

#### 2.3 Computational Rationality in Entrepreneurship

The computational rationality framework offers a unifying perspective on entrepreneurial decisionmaking dichotomies, viewing them as processes of maximizing expected utility while considering computational costs (Gershman et al., 2015; Horvitz et al., 1989). This approach yields key insights: entrepreneurs engage in metalevel decision-making to allocate cognitive resources (Russell and Wefald, 1991), use approximate Bayesian inference to update beliefs based on limited feedback (Tenenbaum et al., 2011), and switch between model-based and model-free decision-making strategies at different venture stages (Daw et al., 2005; Keramati et al., 2011). These perspectives provide a rich framework for understanding how entrepreneurs navigate the tension between optimization and action, offering new avenues for research and practical implications for entrepreneurial strategy.

#### 2.4 Conversational inference as simulation-based calibration

Conversational inference enhances this approach by providing a structured way to calibrate one‚Äôs thought and boostrapping information out of pieces of information. This information spillover introduced as search stopping rule (Gans et al., 2019) has significant connections to established concepts in reinforcement learning and Bayesian calibration. Brown et al. (2010)introduced the concept of information relaxation in stochastic dynamic programs, allowing decisionmakers to access some future information while introducing penalties for violating information constraints. Conversational inference can be seen as a practical implementation of this concept, where entrepreneurs can ‚Äùrelax‚Äù current information constraints by exploring conditional scenarios. Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC) (Modr√°k et al., 2023) showed how user-supplied test quantities can shape sensitivity of existing methods for validating Bayesian computational methods. In our framework, conversational inference can be used to perform a form of SBC, where entrepreneurs can calibrate their beliefs and strategies based on simulated scenarios and conditional probabilities.

#### 2.5 Capitalization operation and SAFE

Capitalization operations are a critical aspect of startup management, involving the strategic acquisition and allocation of financial resources to support growth and scaling. As Feld and Mendelson (2019) emphasizes, understanding these operations is crucial for entrepreneurs navigating the complex landscape of startup financing. The process of capitalization often presents a fundamental dilemma for founders, who must balance the need for substantial capital infusion with the desire to maintain control over their company‚Äôs direction and operations. This challenge is exemplified by companies like Ministry of Supply, Novaconfort, and Tesla, each demonstrating how capitalization decisions can significantly impact operational capabilities, scaling strategies, and overall business trajectories (Fine et al., 2022). These cases illustrate a universal principle in operations management: the intricate interplay between financial resources, operational capacity, and strategic flexibility. Effective capitalization operations require a nuanced understanding of how financial decisions ripple through all aspects of a company‚Äôs operations, from supply chain management to product development and market expansion.

In recent years, Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs) have emerged as an innovative tool in the capitalization toolkit, particularly for early-stage startups. Created by Y Combinator in 2013, SAFEs represent a streamlined approach to early-stage investment, designed to circumvent the complexities of immediate company valuation. Unlike traditional convertible notes, SAFEs eliminate debt features such as interest rates and maturity dates, offering a more flexible and founder-friendly financing option. A key feature of SAFEs is the valuation cap, which provides investors with protection against future dilution while allowing founders to defer valuation discussions. This mechanism exemplifies a core principle in operations finance: the need to align investor incentives with company growth trajectories. However, the use of SAFEs also introduces new complexities in cap table management and conversion mechanics, highlighting the ongoing challenge in operations management of balancing simplicity with comprehensive stakeholder protection. As with all financing tools, the effective use of SAFEs requires careful consideration of their long-term implications on company structure, governance, and operational flexibility.

### 3 Three level architecture and implementation

#### 3.1 Theoretical Level: Bayesian Decision Theory and Problem Definition

At the computational level, we define the problem of equity valuation and term sheet optimization using Bayesian decision theory. This framework provides the foundation for conversational inference, offering a method for updating beliefs in light of new evidence‚Äîcrucial for adaptive decision-making in uncertain entrepreneurial environments.

The core computational problem is to maximize expected utility for both founders and investors. We can express this as an objective function:

x ‚àó (i, c) = arg max i,c E [utility(i, c, M, s, f)]

Where the utility function is defined as founder‚Äôs share √ó price per share. The future valuation is modeled as a Gamma distribution, represented by E[ ], which allows us to calculate expected payoffs under uncertainty.

This mapping illustrates how the theoretical constructs of Bayesian decision theory are practically applied in equity valuation and term sheet optimization. By defining the utility function U and incorporating constraints, we employ probabilistic reasoning E[ ] to make informed decisions that balance the interests of both founders and investors.

Calibration comes into play as we adjust our models based on investor feedback and market conditions, ensuring that our probabilistic predictions remain aligned with real-world observations. This approach enhances the reliability of our inference results and supports more effective entrepreneurial strategies.

These queries allow entrepreneurs to decompose complex problems into manageable components, effectively relaxing resource constraints. To concretize these concepts, we provide a summary that maps key elements such as utility functions, state variables, actions, and other components to their specific roles in our framework for equity value inference and term sheet optimization, as shown in Table 4.

The algorithmic level of decision-making in entrepreneurial contexts follows a cyclical process of perceiving, probabilistic reasoning, and planning. Perception involves breaking down complex situations into manageable components and forming beliefs about the current state. Probabilistic reasoning then uses these beliefs to model uncertainties and potential outcomes, updating probabilities based on new information. Planning takes these probabilistic assessments and develops actionable strategies, which, when implemented, lead to new perceptions and restart the cycle.

In the context of SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) investment negotiations, a founder applies this process to determine optimal valuation caps and investment amounts. The founder perceives current market conditions, company growth trajectories, and investor sentiments. They then use probabilistic reasoning to model potential outcomes of different SAFE terms, considering factors like future dilution and the likelihood of reaching certain valuation milestones. Based on this analysis, the founder plans negotiation strategies and decides on proposed terms. As negotiations progress and new information emerges, the founder continuously updates their perceptions and reasoning, adapting their plan to optimize the balance between immediate capital needs and long-term equity retention.

#### 3.3 Implementation Level: Psychological Factors and Technical Infrastructure

At the implementation level, we consider both the psychological aspects of founder-investor interactions and the technical infrastructure required to support conversational inference.

Psychologically, this level acknowledges the role of cognitive biases, communication strategies, and contextual factors that influence the negotiation process. These include Cognitive processes (How founders and investors perceive value, risk, and potential), Communication patterns (Verbal and non-verbal cues during negotiations), Social dynamics (Trust-building and power dynamics in negotiations), Psychological biases: Anchoring effects, overconfidence, and loss aversion)

Figure 2: Probabilistic computing lab‚Äôs stack supporting equity value inference and term sheet optimization domain

The Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Data-Driven Expert Systems forms the top layer of the probabilistic computing stack, providing a specialized framework for modeling complex financial scenarios such as equity valuation and allocation between founders and investors. In the context of SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) negotiations, this DSL enables the expression of intricate valuation models that account for market trends, growth projections, and the conflicting objectives of founders and investors. It allows for the formulation of optimization problems that seek to maximize expected utility for both parties while balancing constraints such as investment limits, minimum return expectations for investors, and ownership dilution concerns for founders. The DSL facilitates the representation of probabilistic models for future valuations, incorporating uncertainties in market conditions and company growth trajectories, thus providing a nuanced framework for decision-making in startup investments.

The lower layers of the inference stack comprise Inference Programs, Generative Programs, and Probabilistic Programming Platforms, which collectively enable the implementation and execution of conversational inference models. Inference Programs focus on robust and eÔ¨Äicient algorithms that can handle the complexities of financial modeling, offering capabilities such as sequential Monte Carlo methods for sampling from high-dimensional spaces of investment scenarios. These programs emphasize speed, parallelism, and uncertainty quantification, crucial for real-time decision support in dynamic negotiation contexts. Generative Programs provide a unifying representation for diverse probabilistic models, allowing for the specialization of modeling techniques tailored to equity valuation and allocation problems. They enable the expression of complex generative processes that capture the intricacies of startup growth and market dynamics. Underpinning these layers, Probabilistic Programming Platforms offer the foundational infrastructure for building and deploying conversational inference systems. These platforms automate many aspects of inference, ensure scalability to handle large datasets and complex model structures, and maintain soundness through rigorous verification techniques. Together, these layers create a powerful ecosystem for developing sophisticated, data-driven expert systems capable of navigating the complexities of startup valuation and investment negotiations.

1. update diagram to below which explains bimodality, explaining tradeoffs
a) Success scenario: If the startup receives sufficient investment and efficiently converts it into knowledge, it crosses the threshold and achieves a high valuation. This results in high founder utility despite some dilution.
b) Failure scenario: If the startup doesn't receive enough investment, or if the valuation cap is set too high (deterring investment), it may not reach the knowledge threshold before running out of cash. This results in low founder utility.

summary of bimodality in investment amount and valuation cap: The bimodal distribution of founder utility with respect to investment amount and valuation cap reflects the stark contrast between success and failure scenarios in startup ventures. 
‚¨áÔ∏è lower investment amounts or excessively high valuation caps may lead to insufficient funding to reach critical milestones, resulting in low founder utility. 
‚¨ÜÔ∏èhigher investment amounts can provide necessary resources to cross knowledge thresholds and achieve high valuations, but risk over-dilution if paired with low valuation caps.
üèúÔ∏èvalley between these outcomes represents a precarious middle ground where the startup has some funding but struggles to reach its full potential, creating a bimodal landscape that epitomizes the high-risk, high-reward nature of startup investments.
