## ⛰️Scale Stage: Integrating Operational Tools

Definition: "Scale it = Grow in parallel your market size and your production and delivery capability."

This stage focuses on the parallel growth of market size and production/delivery capability, framed as resource allocation between `segment` (market) and `collaborate` (for product) operations. The scaling process involves iterative experimentation in both domains, leveraging integrated reasoning for optimal decision-making.
### <span style="color:purple">💜 Theoretical Need Level (customer_action)</span>

| Component | Segment (Market) | Collaborate (Product) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| State (s) | Market adoption, revenue potential, target market | Production capacity, costs, quality levels, time to market |
| Action (a) | Choose target segment, product specifications | Select production method and location |
| Environment (Env) | MarketAdoptionModel | SupplyChainModel |
| Utility (U) | Market Adoption and Revenue Potential | Probability of scaling before fund depletion |
| Expectation (E[]) | Adoption rates in different segments | Production risks, cost variations, demand fluctuations |
| Argmax | Optimal segment-product fit | Optimal sourcing strategy |
| act* | Finalize segment and product specs | Finalize production decisions |
