abstract: This paper re-examines the relationship between the R&D intensity of an industry and its level of concentration, from the perspective of the Bounds approach to market structure. In so doing, it proposes an index which summarises those aspects of technology and tastes that are relevant to the determination of a lower bound to concentration.

|Section/Subsection|🔐Research Question|🧱Literature Brick|🔑Key Message|📊Empirical Evidence|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Background|What is the relationship between R&D intensity and market structure?|• Phillips (1971) on endogenous relationship<br>• Dasgupta & Stiglitz (1980) on equilibrium models<br>• Cohen & Levin (1989) review of empirical evidence|Previous studies show conflicting results on R&D-concentration correlation with weak effects once controlling for industry-specific factors. The mixed empirical results stem from inadequate measures of relevant technological characteristics and regression models failing to capture the "bounds" constraints.|• Scott (1984): Concentration explains only 1.5% of R&D intensity variance vs. industry effects explaining 32%<br>• Levin et al. (1985): Confirms weak correlation<br>• Casual observation of low-concentration but R&D-intensive industries|
|2. Linear Demand Example|🧠 How can an industry have high R&D intensity but low concentration?|• Sutton (1991, 1995) on market structure and quality investment<br>• Research on product differentiation models|For a given R&D-intensity level, concentration can vary widely depending on substitution parameter (σ) and cost elasticity of quality (β). Combining low σ (products are poor substitutes) with low β (quality is cheap to improve) creates industries with high R&D but low concentration.|📐 Mathematical model showing:<br>• N = 1 + (2/σ - 1)(β/2 - 1)<br>• R/Y = 1/[1 + (c/(1-c))(2+(N-1)σ)]<br>• Fig. 2: Graphical representation of how industries can maintain constant R/Y while concentration decreases|
|3. Bounds Approach|🌏 How can we systematically predict minimum concentration levels across industries?|• Shaked & Sutton (1987) on non-convergence<br>• Sutton (1991) on bounds approach<br>• Game-theoretic models of endogenous sunk costs|The parameter α (alpha) serves as a lower bound to both concentration (C₁) and R&D intensity (R/Y)M. This bound reflects the fundamental constraint that when equilibrium configurations have market shares spread too thinly, firms will deviate by outspending rivals on a single technology.|📐 Formal theorem showing:<br>• C₁ ≥ _C₁ = α<br>• (R/Y)M ≥ α<br>• Fig. 4: Relationship between α and observables (R/Y, h)|
|3.1. Uncovering Alpha|🗺️ How can we infer unobservable α from measurable industry characteristics?|• Research on product proliferation<br>• Literature on economies of scope in R&D|Alpha can be inferred from two observables: industry R&D intensity (R/Y) and proliferation index (h = 1/n, where n is number of technologies). Industries with high R/Y and high h must have high α, while industries with low h may have low concentration despite high R/Y.|• Fig. 5: Predicted relationship between concentration and observables<br>• Shows bounded region of possible market structures|
|3.2. Empirical Illustration|Do real industries show the predicted pattern of relationships?|• FTC Line of Business data (1977)<br>• US Census 7-digit product classifications|For high R&D industries (>4%), the lower bound to concentration increases with h, while for low R&D industries, h has no effect on minimum concentration, confirming theoretical predictions.|• Fig. 6: Scatter plots contrasting concentration vs. h for:<br>- Control group of low R&D industries<br>- High R&D industries (>4%)<br>• Shows clear lower bound rising with h for high R&D group|
|4. Aggregation Issues|Is the relationship between R&D and concentration simply an aggregation problem?|• Studies on industry definitions<br>• Research on market boundaries|Low alpha industries fundamentally feature fragmentation into many overlapping submarkets because technology and preferences favor proliferation over escalation. This isn't merely a measurement issue but reflects fundamental technology and preference structures.|• Flowmeter industry case showing multiple technologies (electromagnetic, ultrasonic, Coriolis) serving different applications<br>• Each technology based on different physical principles with distinct limitations|
|5. Case Studies|🧭 What historical patterns confirm the escalation vs. proliferation distinction?|• Industry histories in high vs. low alpha sectors<br>• Studies of technological trajectories|"Natural experiments" confirm theory: high-alpha industries show shakeout and concentration when R&D escalates (e.g., color film), while low-alpha industries maintain many viable mid-sized firms specializing in specific technologies.|• Photographic film industry: Escalation led to dominance by five firms (Kodak, Fuji, Konica, Agfa-Gevaert, 3M)<br>• Flowmeter industry: Mid-sized firms like KDG Mobrey (12-14 R&D staff) successfully compete on leading-edge technologies|
|6-7. Implications and Conclusions|👓 What are the broader implications for industrial organization theory?|• Schumpeter on theory and history<br>• Critique of regression-based approaches|Market structure is not uniquely determined by a "true model" but bounded by strong mechanisms. This suggests replacing traditional regressions with bounds-based approaches that recognize the multiplicity of equilibria consistent with fundamental constraints.|• Systematic empirical patterns across industries serve as validation of the theoretical constraints<br>• Case studies provide qualitative confirmation of theoretical mechanisms|


This analysis shows how Sutton develops a novel theoretical framework centered on the parameter α that explains previously contradictory empirical findings about R&D intensity and market concentration. The key insight is that concentration has a lower bound determined by technological opportunities (β) and substitutability (σ), but above this bound, many different market structures are possible depending on historical developments and firm strategies. This "bounds approach" reconciles the weak empirical correlations found in previous studies while providing a more nuanced understanding of how technology shapes industrial organization.
