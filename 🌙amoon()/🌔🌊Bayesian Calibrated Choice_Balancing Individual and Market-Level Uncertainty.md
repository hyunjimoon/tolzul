The final transformation from **BPD|E** to **BPDE** presents a cohesive framework that fully integrates belief, prior, desire, and environment functions. This state reflects how individual entrepreneurial cognition can align with societal-level uncertainty dynamics. This theoretical advancement illustrates how entrepreneurs can effectively synchronize their cognitive processes with market-level epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, thereby achieving Bayesian calibrated choices. Employing simulation-based calibration, we validate the conditions under which individual cognitive architectures maintain consistency with overarching market distributions. The integration of program synthesis models this alignment, reinforcing the Bayesian self-consistency equations that connect individual and market-level uncertainties. This sequential approach not only enhances theoretical insights into entrepreneurial decision-making but also offers practical methodologies for assessing and improving the effectiveness of entrepreneurial strategies in fluctuating environments.

    This paper challenges Arrow's impossibility theorem in entrepreneurial settings. While Arrow proved that perfectly combining different preferences is mathematically impossible, we show how entrepreneurs can achieve practical solutions through statistical learning. Studying ventures like Tesla and Waymo reveals two key challenges: managing conflicting motivations within teams (profitability vs. safety vs. environmental impact) and evaluating contrasting approaches across ventures (camera-only vs. multi-sensor autonomous driving). Our framework shows how statistical testing and simulation can turn these apparent conflicts into opportunities for innovation. Rather than adding complexity, considering team and market context through systematic testing actually simplifies decision-making by revealing hidden patterns. For example, when Tesla tests self-driving technology, each road test not only validates technical assumptions but also reveals how different stakeholders define success. These patterns help identify unexplored possibilities that satisfy multiple stakeholder needs. Through case studies of successful ventures, we demonstrate how entrepreneurs can navigate complex stakeholder preferences not by seeking perfect solutions, but by building better learning processes that reveal integration opportunities in seemingly impossible trade-offs.

\subsection{Simulation Bayesian calibration}
Simulation-Based Calibration Checking for Bayesian Computation: The Choice of Test Quantities Shapes Sensitivity. Simulation-based calibration checking (SBC) is a practical method to validate computationallyderived posterior distributions or their approximations. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of SBC to alleviate several known problems. Our variant allows the user to in principle detect any possible issue with the posterior, while previously reported implementations could never detect large classes of problems including when the posterior is equal to the prior. This is made possible by including additional data-dependent test quantities when running SBC. We argue and demonstrate that the joint likelihood of the data is an especially useful test quantity. Some other types of test quantities and their theoretical and practical benefits are also investigated. We support our recommendations with numerical case studies on a multivariate normal example and theoretical analysis of SBC, thereby providing a more complete understanding of the underlying statistical mechanisms. From the theoretical side, we also bring attention to a relatively common mistake in the literature and clarify the difference between SBC and checks based on the dataaveraged posterior. The SBC variant introduced in this paper is implemented in the SBC R package.
