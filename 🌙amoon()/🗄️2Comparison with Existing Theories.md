# ‚úçÔ∏è Key

- **Temporal Complexity** = How much uncertainty unfolds over time.
    
- **Spatial Complexity** = How many stakeholders/variables interact.
    
- **Reality Fit** = How closely the model matches real entrepreneurial conditions.
    
- **Need for New Approach** =
    
    - ‚úÖ = your _federated learning_ (for temporal) and _proactive proposal testing_ (for spatial) become essential.

### üéØ Why this structure works:

- Quickly shows that as we move **right ‚Üí**, reality fit increases but **tractability collapses**.
    
- Builds intuitive reason **why smart uncertainty minimization methods** are necessary.
    
- Shows **where** your methods kick in (middle-high complexity) without overwhelming readers.
    



The table below compares various entrepreneurial decision models, progressing from a simple single-stakeholder strategy to a highly detailed multi-stakeholder operational model. It shows how **temporal complexity** (time/horizon) and **spatial complexity** (breadth of stakeholders/variables) increase along this spectrum, leading to higher dimensionality, reduced tractability, and changes in phenomenological accuracy. At the extreme end, traditional optimization and heuristic methods become insufficient ‚Äì underscoring the need for new approaches like **federated learning** (to manage temporal complexity) and **proactive proposal testing** (to manage spatial complexity).
