choice (agent-based view, freedom view) entails
- bias (global, differential equation based model view)
- degeneracy in calibration (control view)

Owning unfair advantage matters in entrepreneurship.  
First, it lowers entrepreneurial threshold; optimistic bias nudges people to start their own entrepreneurial journey.

Real example: Having a comparative advantage on data supply (uncle in bio industry) gave courage for Ryan Hill and Carolyn Stein to pursue entrepreneurial research topic on "Priority races". 

Second, it shapes the geometry of entrepreneurial choice. It is cognitively tempting to ask "how to leverage my advantage to play the winning game" rather than to ask "how to globally optimize entrepreneurial choices given an decision making uncertainty agent with freedom of choice". 

Theory: [Neal's funnel](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/reparameterization.html#funnel.figure) cause: step size that works well in the body and neck differs; this is a function of the amount of data and separation of parameter (re parameterization)
- No-U-Turn sampler requires many steps when starting in the tail of the distribution; with a large step size, there will be too much rejection in the central portion of the distribution. This problem may be mitigated by defining the Cauchy-distributed variable as the transform of a uniformly distributed variable using the Cauchy inverse cumulative distribution function
- extremity of the correlation depends on the amount of data, with Neal’s funnel being the extreme with no data. In these cases, the non-centered parameterization, discussed in the next section, is preferable; when there is a lot of data, the centered parameterization is more efficient. See Betancourt and Girolami (2013) for more information on the effects of centering in hierarchical models fit with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Third, it shortens time to scale. Well-chosen unfair advantage that can readily become core capability shortens exploration and early stop nail it stage without loss.

Theory: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling has warmup phase which is parallel to nail it stage. Just as we seek new organization members, ideas, product concepts to improve producer-product-consumer match, MCMC warmup phase goes through automatic parmaeter tuning phase that explores discretization time ϵ, metric M, number of steps taken L to improve the mental model-implementation-data match. Due to existing degree of freedom in this match, it is easier to configure mental model than to rewire computational algorithm used to translate mental model to implementation. This means  Iterating the exploration in high and low dimension (lift to higher dimension, project to lower dimension) is more efficient (hierarchical gibbs sampling is fast as it can parameterically encode domain knowledge) and effective (lift and project cut vouches convergence to integral polytope) than monotonous exploration in the same dimension.
