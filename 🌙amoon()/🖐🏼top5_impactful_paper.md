## interesting

using Davis' Index of the Interesting. I'm aware of the [need for bridge from interesting to important](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.4002), but paper has interesting lowbar to pass to even be judged on its importance.

## implementable

it should have a tool to implement what the audience learn. 
- how to resolve "resistance to change"
- if supplying the research for the audience with economics background, i should camouflage the language to what they can (and don't have uncomfortableness in) digesting.
