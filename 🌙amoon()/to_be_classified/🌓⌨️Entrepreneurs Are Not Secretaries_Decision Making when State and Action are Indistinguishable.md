- using [subjective equivalence classes based on desire and belief cld](https://claude.ai/chat/55af53dc-bbc1-4785-a9ee-bdf451a6a460)

abstract: The optimal stopping theory, formalized in the Secretary Problem, assumes three key conditions: (1) perfect relative ranking between observed candidates, (2) irrevocable sequential decisions, and (3) fixed candidate quality independent of observation order. Under these conditions, the optimal strategy achieves a 1/e (‚âà37%) success rate by rejecting the first n/e candidates and selecting the next candidate who exceeds all previous observations. While this framework has been applied to entrepreneurial decision-making, we demonstrate why these assumptions fundamentally break down in entrepreneurship. Our analysis shows that entrepreneurial decisions simultaneously create and discover the space of possible states and actions - the very act of observing changes both what can be observed and how future observations are evaluated. Using a four-step state-action evolution framework, we formalize how entrepreneurs' beliefs and desires actively shape their opportunity landscape, unlike the fixed-state space of the Secretary Problem. This reconceptualization contributes to understanding belief heterogeneity in entrepreneurship and suggests new approaches for designing both societal matching mechanisms and individual path-finding algorithms that account for the co-evolution of knowledge states and action possibilities.



# üóÑÔ∏è secretary vs opportunity
| name of assumption | Secretary searching | Opportunities searching |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Fixed State Space | Nature presents n candidates in random order; perfect ranking possible between seen candidates | Nature presents evolving opportunities; ranking depends on entrepreneur's accumulated knowledge and actions |
| Fixed Exchangeability | All candidates are assumed exchangeable before seeing them; only their relative rank matters | Opportunities are not exchangeable - each exploration changes both the explorer and exploration space |
| Known Uncertainty Structure | Only uncertainty is about future candidates' ranks; no latent variables considered | Multiple uncertainties: about opportunity value, about how exploration changes understanding, about what's possible |
| Static Decision Rule | Simple stopping rule: reject first n/e candidates, then hire first best-so-far | Dynamic learning rule: each action both evaluates current opportunity and shapes ability to recognize future ones |

| Step | Entrepreneurs searching for opportunities |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 1. Choose Random (üîµ) | Start with seemingly conflicting goals/opportunities (like team's different perspectives) and treat them as random samples from possibility space |
| 2. Verify Exchangeability (üîµ‚û°Ô∏èüî¥) | Test if different goals/perspectives can be grouped into meaningful patterns; look for hidden connections between seemingly opposing views |
| 3. Represent Ignorance (üíö) | Acknowledge that conflicts might signal unexplored integration possibilities; represent uncertainty about how goals could complement rather than compete |
| 4. Make Knowledge (üî¥) | Transform conflicting perspectives into integrated knowledge; build shared understanding that combines multiple viewpoints into richer possibilities |
