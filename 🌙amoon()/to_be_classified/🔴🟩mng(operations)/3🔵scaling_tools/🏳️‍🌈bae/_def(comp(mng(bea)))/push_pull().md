- center is `inventory` and
	- pull strategy := supply(supply(`demand`)), 
	- push strategy := supply(`inventory`), demand(`inventory`) a.k.a. starting from methodology(hammer) vs problem (nail) (ready fire aim was )
- nail-scale-sail, hammer-fire-sail (recognition and fame-based)

-  [[mng(bit))]]  is easier to pull,  [[mng(atom)]]  is easier to push, but may change in nail, scale, sail stage #cfq


When should an early stage entrepreneur follow customer pull or technology push strategy? We endogenize this stakeholder prioritization decision by framing entrepreneur's objective as minimizing mismatch cost between supply and demand side commitments. In specific, an entrepreneur's reasoning to manage quality is modeled by combining discrete choice model and newsvendor model. Like manager choosing order quantity that minimize expected cost (opportunity cost and over stock cost) given predicted demand, entrepreneurs choose quality that minimize cost given stakeholders' predicted commitments. Resulting optimal quality then determines which stakeholder to prioritize.
