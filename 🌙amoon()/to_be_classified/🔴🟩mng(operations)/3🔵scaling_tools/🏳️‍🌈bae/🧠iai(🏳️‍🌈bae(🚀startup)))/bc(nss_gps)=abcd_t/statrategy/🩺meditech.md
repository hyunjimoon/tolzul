  The most detailed discussion about Meditech occurred on February 1, 2024 ([charlie <> angie](https://otter.ai/u/ZLcL-H03xNjOMkxMTBm4Qh5sae8)), where you asked Charlie whether Meditech was closer to hardware or software on the technology spectrum. In a June 17, 2024 meeting ([Angie & Charlie](https://otter.ai/u/-S4KopLNnb3Xhpuqvq_TcIklnoA)), you mentioned developing a Meditech case study and discussed an inference problem related to whether there exists a win-win strategy for the CEO and investors. You explained that Sunil needed to persuade the CEO about in-housing packaging assembly of cables without diluting equity share while maximizing profit. On June 20, 2024 ([Angie & Charlie](https://otter.ai/u/UhQ0xO-oyteW5AsqdFfeRoXYG3Q)), Charlie discussed potential parameters for the Meditech case, suggesting "image fidelity" as x1 and "processing time" as x2. He explained the importance of low latency for surgical applications, noting that even high-fidelity images aren't useful if they arrive with significant delay during surgery. In a later conversation on April 1, 2025 ([Angie & Charlie|choose three tools](https://otter.ai/u/WPrq-nqnXfXjvRs3sJDRVhwnB5c)), Charlie referenced Meditech as an example of a company that fundraises with clear purpose, stating "Meditech said we want to get FDA approval of our device. We know why we need funds." These conversations suggest Meditech was a medical device company seeking FDA approval that you used as a case study in your research with Charlie.
