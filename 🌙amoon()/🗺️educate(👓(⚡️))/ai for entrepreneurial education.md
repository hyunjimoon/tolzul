innovation policy for a nation is entrepreneurial strategy for an individual; 
action targeted for rational, political, cultural purpose have different time to realization but 
recognizing inside (nsp_recog), predict outside (nsp_pred)
learning curve

sol: bit and atom management of innovative augmented intelligence 
need: operations for entrepreneurs

desireabiliy * feasibility * viability

desireabiliy * feasibility_{op, tech} * 1/cost (opp. cost included)

criticality * fidelity / opportunity cost

- certain uncertainty has been greatly decreased perceptually
fired: opportunity cost

- demand:

definition : 
- startup failure: A venture has failed if early investors did not‚Äîor never will‚Äîget back more money than they put in

two improvements: #automate  operations like #evaluate with iai, 
action: testing, 
evaluate: objectifying, axis to project on for quality quantification)
estimate: 
- multiple paths, limited resource, uncertain environment, noisy learning 

- emotional maturity, adaptability, validation, multiple perspective, listening, managing up, productive inclusion, followship, humility, cognitive readiness
## iai: innovative augmented intelligence

what should we teach to entrep?

depending on what agents we are viewing, 
push not only the local but also global frontier

sharp skills: economics, 
smart skills: 
different time scale
