Introduction|How can AI agents rapidly adapt to unseen agents in mixed-motive environments?|• MARL algorithms for zero-sum games (Vinyals et al., 2019)<br>• MARL for cooperative environments (Barrett et al., 2011)<br>• Mixed-motive environment research (Dafoe et al., 2020)<br>• Sequential social dilemmas work (Leibo et al., 2017)|🧍‍♀️Mixed-motive environments require balancing short-term interests with long-term rewards while considering trade-offs between 🗺️self-interest and group benefit.
