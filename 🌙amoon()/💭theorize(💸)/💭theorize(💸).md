# Theorize: Bridging Bayesian & Evolution

**Process and product achieve consistency here.** In this outer orbital domain, I develop theoretical frameworks that connect Bayesian inference with evolutionary ([[📝🧭Vectorizing Adaptation]]) principles through probabilistic programming.

## Core Approaches

- **Bayesian Calibration**: Developing mathematical models that accurately represent uncertainty through prior knowledge and observed data
- **Evolutionary Entrepreneurship**: Studying how entrepreneurial approaches adapt and evolve in complex systems
- **Probabilistic Programming**: Creating computational frameworks that express probabilistic models as programs

## Key Projects

- **MIT Bayesian Entrepreneurship Research Lab**: Founded interdisciplinary research initiative connecting statistical theory with entrepreneurial practice
- **Bayesian Data Analysis Translation**: Made foundational statistical concepts accessible to non-specialists through translation work
- **A2S Ratio Development**: Pioneering metric for evaluating the balance between algorithmic and statistical components in decision systems

## Publications

- "Simulation-Based Calibration Checking for Bayesian Computation"

The theoretical domain exists not in isolation but as the foundation for both [[📐produce(💭)]] and [[💸Evaluate()]] domains. As the outermost orbit, it moves deliberately, creating space for deep thinking and rigorous foundation-building.
