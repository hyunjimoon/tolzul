| [[🌀culturate]] | Temporal, Process, Management            | Creating and maintaining a strong organizational culture that supports company goals. "Building, evolving, and nourishing a culture that supports the organization's goals and values is critical to efficient scaling." Culture starts with mission and values that must be consistently reinforced.                                                         |
| [[🟩collaborate]]     | Partnership, Risk                        | Involves partnering with suppliers, distributors, and technology partners to extend reach. "A collaborator is often both a value-adding partner and a competitor for a share of the total value-chain profits available." Successful collaboration provides mutual benefits based on complementary skills and goals.                                          |
| [[🔵capitalize]]      | Ownership, Pace, Process, Risk           | Managing capital requirements for scaling. "Capital requirements for scaling can vary very widely, depending on the nature of the business," and founders often face "the dilemma of needing to give up significant control if they want access to the necessary capital."                                                                                    |
| [[💜segment]]    | Market, Exploration, Focus               | Targets different market segments with specialized offerings. "Segmentation is not just bringing on new customers, but also requires the capabilities of differentiated production, distribution, and delivery." As companies scale, they need to expand beyond their initial "beachhead market" into adjacent segments, which adds complexity to operations. |
