We compare two modeling philosophies (System Dynamics, differential equation based (SD/DE) and Discrete Event/Agent-Based Simulation (DES/ABM) around the use of the model.  Their differences are highlighted around algorithm and tool building, model construction and analysis, policy design, stakeholder engagement, model adaptation which I call modeling value chain with two feedback loops.

Explanation for Table 9 (Inference Feedback):  The "Algorithm and Tool Building" group encompasses the fundamental approaches and tools used in each modeling paradigm, while the "Model Building and Analysis" group details the specific techniques and considerations in constructing and analyzing models within each approach. System Dynamics (SD) and Discrete Event/Agent-Based Simulation (DES/ABM) differ fundamentally in their approach to modeling time, system structure, and inference. SD models use continuous time representation with a global clock, while DES/ABM models use discrete events with a simulation clock [1,2,3,4]. SD is relation-based, using differential equations to identify structure and relationships within the system, whereas DES/ABM is object-based [3,4]. "Nonlinear DE models can easily encompass a wide range of feedback effects, but typically aggregate agents into a relatively small number of states (compartments)" [5]. In terms of stochasticity, it can incorporate as partially documented in [[Process noise and Feature noise]] and [[Noise and uncertainty]], "but not primary focus" in SD , while it's a "central feature" in DES/ABM [2,4,5]. SD often uses deconvolution for inference, while DES/ABM typically uses convolution. The treatment of time delays also differs, with SD using "distributed delays" and DES/ABM using "discrete waiting times" [1,4]. However, it's important to note that "even the best SD models are at least potentially problematical, if not outright mischaracterizations of the systems they purport to describe" due to aggregation issues [6]. For fun, Dirichlet problem is finding a function which solves a specified PDE in the interior of a given region which satifies boundary values.

Explanation for Table 10 (Decision Feedback):  The "Policy Design and Stakeholder Engagement" group focuses on how each modeling approach is applied in practical decision-making contexts and communicated to stakeholders, while the "Feedback and Iteration" group highlights the ongoing processes of model refinement, learning, and potential integration between the two approaches. The applications and policy implications of SD and DES/ABM models differ significantly, but there's potential for cross-learning. SD is typically used for "strategic, policy-level problems," while DES/ABM is more suited for "operational, tactical problems" [3,5]. "Here we focus on the policy context. Policymakers face a world of time pressure, inadequate data, and limited knowledge of parameters such as pathogen virulence, transmissibility, incubation latency, treatment efficacy, etc." [5]. In scenario exploration, SD focuses on "policy leverage points, long-term behavior modes," while DES/ABM emphasizes "operational improvements, resource allocation" [3]. For result communication, SD often uses "causal loop diagrams, behavior over time graphs," whereas DES/ABM utilizes "animation of processes/agents, statistical outputs" [4]. Both approaches can incorporate hybrid elements [2,4,6], and there's significant potential for cross-learning. As noted, "SD and agent-based modeling are a match made in heaven. At some level disaggregate models still need aggregate representations of agents; modelers could learn a lot from SD about good representation of behavior and dynamics, not to mention good habits like units checking that are seldom followed. At the same time, SD modelers could learn a lot about emergent phenomena and the limitations of aggregate representations" [6]. However, it's crucial to recognize that "models seldom inform policy directly; their influence occurs through improvement of mental models" [6], emphasizing the importance of effective communication of insights to decision-makers.
