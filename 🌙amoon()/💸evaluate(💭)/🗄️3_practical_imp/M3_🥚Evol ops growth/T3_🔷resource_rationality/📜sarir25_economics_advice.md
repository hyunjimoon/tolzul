## Key Research Question & Findings

The paper investigates how business advice from angel investors and venture capitalists shapes early startup development and success. The most significant findings include:

- Causal evidence that mentoring improves startup outcomes: An additional hour increases the probability of above-median funding by 3% and survival by 1%
- Mentors encourage founders to "do less and learn more" by prioritizing analysis and experimentation over implementation
- Angels are twice more likely than VCs to provide experimentation advice, driven by their greater operating experience
- VCs specialize in analysis and organizational development, helping establish business structure

## Need-Solution Mapping

The poster illustrates the problem (limited understanding of advice effects, investor differences, and mechanisms) and the solution (leveraging a global entrepreneurship program with detailed data on mentoring activities and outcomes).

## Methodology Visualization

I've included a framework showing the four conceptual categories of startup activities that the author developed:

- Analysis: Low-commitment learning
- Experimentation: High-commitment learning
- Implementation: Executing on ideas
- Resource Acquisition: Obtaining capital, talent, and IP

The visualization highlights a key tradeoff between learning and execution, showing that founders typically prefer implementation and resource acquisition, while mentors push them toward analysis and experimentation.

## Comparison with Existing Theories

The poster compares previous theoretical views with the empirical findings from this study, highlighting:

- Value of advice: Moving from theoretical assumptions to causal evidence
- Angel vs. VC value-add: Revealing complementary skills rather than competing assumptions
- Mechanism: Shifting from networks/reputation to learning and skill transfer

## Practical Applications

The poster concludes with implications for different stakeholders:

- Founders: Match investor type to business needs and focus on learning before scaling
- Policymakers: Consider human capital when designing entrepreneurship policies
- Accelerators: Balance mentor portfolio between angels and VCs

This poster effectively captures both the scientific contribution and practical relevance of the research on startup mentoring.
