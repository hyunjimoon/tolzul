Platform collaboration with pull, pool, push strategy
- pull: invest infrastructure (solar power), educate, 
- pool: information 
- push: separate (treat differently; acute and chronic)
- nation is platform for business and individual, business is platform for individual (order of capacity to endure worse then better dynamic)
- trust-building atomization
- test and update atomization (build balance loop, feature)

standalone, same side, other side (platform revenue being invested to and how user data create value)
Win-lose situation:

-  neighboring bakeries won't share information - B2C Paris Baguet CTO

#### Pull, Pool, Push 2 Prevent
- Inequality from national and global level
