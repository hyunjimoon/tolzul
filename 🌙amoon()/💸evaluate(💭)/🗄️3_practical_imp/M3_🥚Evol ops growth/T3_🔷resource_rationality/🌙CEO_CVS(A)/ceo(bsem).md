### prompt
wwh (why, what, how of the paper) is a backbone of abstract. based on the update from [old abstract] to [new abstract], give me [new wwh] 

### om_v1 wa
why: Level of cognitive and engineering science are matured enough to converge, which provides opportunities in structure learning and solving well-formulated problem with enhanced reasoning
what: Develop an AI-based framework for creating attentive, coherent, and actionable manufacturing strategies, integrating rational agency principles with manufacturing decision categories.
how:  the complexity of manufacturing strategy development by outsourcing


## strat_v4
Certainly! I'll organize the paper according to the CMO, CTO, and COO structure, incorporating the outline I proposed and placing the tables and figures in appropriate locations. Here's the reorganized structure:

1. Why: Resolve the paradox of entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty and dynamic environments
2. What: A Human-AI collaboration framework integrating rational agent theory with entrepreneurial cognition VS hierarchical bayesian for startup pivoting
3. How:
    - Dual decomposition of rational agent equation: component-wise and function-wise
    - Separation of AI-driven data processing from human-led strategic decision-making
    - Demonstration through Tesla Roadster case study

why: smarter and speedier decision for entrepreneurs 
what: probabilistic program for bayesian entrepreneurship for entrepreneurs
how: ground entrepreneurial choice axioms with bayesian statistics and optimization with two tables. first table grounds entrepreneurial choice axioms with bayesian statistics and optimization. second table grounds bayesian statistics and optimization with software program.

| CEO                                                              | Angie                                | 0.abstract<br>This paper introduces a Human-AI collaboration framework to enhance entrepreneurial decision-making in dynamic environments. Grounded in the fundamental equation of AI for rational agency, our approach treats equation components as a basis in entrepreneurial function space. We map these components to entrepreneurial axioms, while the equation's algorithmic representation gives rise to entrepreneurial functions. This dual approach reflects bottom-up and top-down perspectives: component-wise decomposition (utility, environment, action form and function, state, expected value) and functional expression (simplifying, optimizing, probabilistic reasoning, calibrating) respectively. Each function incorporates backward inference and forward planning processes. AI handles well-defined computational tasks, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on high-level strategy formulation and refinement. This framework enables choice in level of intervention, which helps mitigate the loss from unexpected pivoting, such as loss of time and momentum. Our research offers a new paradigm for efficient decision-making in high-stakes environments, advancing our understanding of entrepreneurial strategy by bridging biological adaptation and evolution strategies with AI-driven tools. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |      |
