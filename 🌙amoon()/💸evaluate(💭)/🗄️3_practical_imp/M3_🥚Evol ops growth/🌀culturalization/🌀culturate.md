A strong, positive, continually reinforced culture serves as the glue that keeps an organization together, especially once it has outgrown its single room with constant face-to-face communication amongst the founding team. (If that team room is a "Zoom room," the challenges of creating and nurturing the culture are even greater.)

Building, evolving, and nourishing a culture that supports the organization's goals and values is critical to efficient scaling. During rapid growth, the sheer number of employees and partners that are added creates significant challenges to acculturate every new joiner, as well as maintain the passion amongst the organization's veterans.

Entropy is a natural phenomenon in virtually all organizations, so a culture that is not constantly communicated is liable to fragment over time. Cultural reinforcement must remain the job of the top leadership team. Say it every day if you mean it.

Culture starts with the mission and the values. If these elements are expressed with authenticity and passion and are reinforced every day, they will inculcate habits of reinforcement throughout the organization. Such consistency is a tall order for large groups of people.

Further, as the organization grows, the culture will be dynamic.

Guiding this process requires thought, attention, and lots of communication, and when moving from the jungle to the mountain to the ocean, leaders should acknowledge publicly the evolution and transformation of this culture.

Mini Case Study: In their book "How Google Works" (2017), former CEO Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg paint a vivid portrait of the creativity and fluidity within Google culture in its early days.

More recently, many former employees and commentators have lamented the corporatization of Google and the diminishment of the culture that sparked so much success.

Yet, a March 2024 Wired story that relates the creation of the transformer model that has revolutionized Al, describes a serendipitous process that has delivered an innovation, so impactful that it literally has changed the world, just as Google Search did three decades earlier. So, despite the dramatic corporatization of the Internet giant, embers of the early innovation-encouraging culture live on.
