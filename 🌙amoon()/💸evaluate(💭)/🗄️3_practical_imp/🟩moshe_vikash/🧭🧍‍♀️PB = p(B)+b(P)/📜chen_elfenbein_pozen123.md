#### 2018 The Impact of Learning and Overconﬁdence on Entrepreneurial Entry and Exit
Empirical evidence suggests that entrepreneurs make mistakes: too many enter markets and, once there, persist too long. Although scholars have largely settled on behavioral bias as the cause, we suggest that this consensus is premature. These mistakes may also arise from a process in which entrepreneurs continually learn about their prospects and make entry and exit decisions based on what they have learned. We develop a computational model of this process that connects pre- and post-entry learning and can be directed to analyze Bayesian-rational or biased entrepreneurs. The model suggests that, to outside observers, rational entrepreneurs may appear overconﬁdent, seem to take too long to exit, and exhibit a positive correlation between entry cost and persistence in the market. When examining conﬁdence biases, the model suggests that entrepreneurs whose biases cause them to perform the worst after entry will be most likely to enter, that pre-entry learning induces a positive correlation between distinct conﬁdence biases among entrants, and that exit changes the prevalence of certain biases in the surviving population of entrants over time. Our study also speaks to recent work on pre-entry experience that documents the transfer of knowledge from parent to progeny ﬁrms, suggesting that, in addition to inheritance, differential performance may also be the result of heterogeneity in the length and quality of pre-entry learning during which an opportunity is assessed.

#### 2022: The Problems and Promise of Entrepreneurial Partnerships: Decision-making, Overconfidence, and Learning in Founding Teams 

How should decision-making be organized in entrepreneurial teams when founders exhibit confidence biases? New ventures are commonly founded by teams of entrepreneurs, who must employ a decision-making structure that implicitly or explicitly defines how individual beliefs are aggregated into team decisions. We consider this issue through the lens of organizational economics, which focuses on decision-making governance. Using a computational model, we consider three archetypal decision-making structures: partnership voting, a boss with employees, and a buyout option (partnership convertible to boss structure). We highlight the conditions under which partnership voting is an effective means of governing market entry and exit decisions when teams’ decision-making is informed by efforts to learn about the merits of uncertain opportunities. The promise of partnership voting is realized when entrepreneurs are either unbiased or optimistic about their likelihood of success. Partnership voting is problematic when entrepreneurs differ in their biases or respond too rapidly to new information, in which case a buyout option is better. From a policy perspective, we show that confidence biases may be managed by selectively matching the decision-making structure to entrepreneurs’ biases, and that doing so may substantially improve the performance of new ventures.
