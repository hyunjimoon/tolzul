## Abstract
This paper develops a computational framework for understanding entrepreneurial cognitive resource allocation during venture scaling. Through vector-based modeling of cost-reducing and revenue-growing activities, we demonstrate how seemingly biased allocation patterns emerge as rational adaptations to industry-specific returns and uncertainties. Our framework unifies entrepreneurial decision-making through two key dimensions: directional focus between market and operations, and execution speed in sampling and action.
## 1: Vector Formalization of Entrepreneurial Decision-Making

The foundation of our framework rests on a novel conceptualization: entrepreneurial decision-making as a dynamic vector in a cognitive resource space. This vector formalization captures two critical dimensions of entrepreneurial cognition - the direction of attention allocation between operational and market concerns, and the magnitude of execution speed. By modeling cognitive resource allocation as a vector, we bridge the apparent gap between observed entrepreneurial behavior and rational decision-making theory.

Our synthesis of computational rationality frameworks reveals how this vector operates within bounded cognitive constraints. Drawing from [[üìúGershman15_comp_rationality]] unified computational theory, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs' seemingly simplified heuristics can produce globally optimal decisions despite their apparent biases. This theoretical foundation is further strengthened by [[üìúBhui21_resource_rational_dm]] mathematical framework, which explicitly connects cognitive limitations to attention allocation patterns in repeated decisions.

The relationship between operational and market precision can be quantified through key parameter pairs:

| Parameter Pair                                           | Relationship                                                                                                                                                 | Industry Effect                                                                                                                                     |

This quantitative framework aligns with our mathematical formalization of the entrepreneur's cognitive process:

1. Belief formation through Bayesian updating: $\color{Green}{p_c} \sim Beta(\alpha_c, \beta_c), \color{Purple}{p_r} \sim Beta(\alpha_r, \beta_r)$
2. Prediction generation incorporating environmental noise: $\color{Green}{pred_c} = exp(N(\color{Green}{p_c}, \color{skyblue}{\sigma_c})), \color{Purple}{pred_r} = exp(N(\color{Purple}{p_r}, \color{skyblue}{\sigma_r}))$
3. Action selection maximizing expected utility: $\color{Red}{a^*} = \underset{\color{Red}{a \in {a_c, a_r}}}{\arg\max} : \Delta\color{Red}{U}(\color{Green}{pred_c}, \color{Purple}{pred_r}, \color{Red}{a})$

The power of this vector-based approach lies in its ability to explain diverse entrepreneurial behaviors as rational adaptations to different environmental conditions. ‚≠êÔ∏èJust as a compass needle responds to magnetic fields, the entrepreneurial decision vector aligns with the underlying probability structure of the environment. This alignment process raises a fundamental question that drives our subsequent analysis: How do different environmental conditions shape these decision vectors, and what determines their optimal orientation across various industry clockspeeds?
## 2. Vector Direction: Rational Adaptation to Environmental Signals

The directional component of entrepreneurial decision vectors emerges as a rational response to industry-specific probability structures. Our analysis reveals how different environments generate distinct success probability ratios ($\color{Green}{p_c}/\color{Purple}{p_r}$ ), which systematically shape entrepreneurial resource allocation patterns.

As depicted in our learning trajectories analysis ([[üéûÔ∏èüß≠.png]]), we observe distinct adaptation patterns across physical and digital industries:

Drawing from [[üìúfine17_e2e]]  analysis of operational decision interdependence, we demonstrate that what appears as modular decision-making‚Äîchoosing between operational efficiency and market expansion‚Äîactually represents an integrated system of cognitive resource allocation. This integration becomes particularly evident in how uncertainty bands ($\color{skyblue}{\sigma_c}$, $\color{skyblue}{\sigma_r}$) narrow over time as firms learn their environment's true probability structure.

The rationality of these allocation patterns emerges from the underlying probability structures rather than cognitive limitations or biases. We observe three key features in the adaptation process:
1. **Initial Uncertainty:** Both trajectories start at parity ($\color{Green}{p_c}/\color{Purple}{p_r}$ = 1) but quickly diverge based on environmental signals
2. **Learning Rate:** Digital industries show faster initial adaptation (steeper slope in first 5 time steps)
3. **Steady State:** Physical industries stabilize at higher operational focus while digital industries maintain market orientation

This evidence supports our theoretical prediction that environmental probability structures ($\color{Green}{p_c}$, $\color{Purple}{p_r}$) drive rational adaptation in resource allocation, rather than resulting from cognitive limitations. The systematic variation across industries raises a critical temporal question: Given these environmental signals, how quickly should entrepreneurs adjust their strategic vectors?

## 3. Vector Speed: Decision Speed Under Environmental Pressure

The magnitude of our entrepreneurial decision vector, characterized by execution speed, reveals how optimal decision-making evolves across both space (industries) and time (venture stages). As shown in  [[üéûÔ∏èüèéÔ∏è.png]], this evolution manifests in both delay cost structure (left panels) and decision framework complexity (right panels).

### 3.1 Time-Space Evolution of Decision Frameworks
The right panels of [[üéûÔ∏èüèéÔ∏è.png]] demonstrate three progressive relaxations of decision constraints:

1. Fixed Timestep (`.`): Assumes uniform decision speed across industries
2. Timestep with Spatial Variation (`_s`): Allows industry-specific speeds (e.g., rapid software engineering vs. slow diamond mining)
3. Timestep with Spatiotemporal Variation (`_st`): Enables phase-specific speeds (e.g. nail vs. sail) within industries

These relaxations can be formally expressed as: **‚ôªÔ∏è Space then Time (ST) Relaxation:** $\underset{\color{Red}{a}}{argmax} U(\color{Green}{\Delta c}, \color{Purple}{\Delta r}, \color{Red}{a}\color{white}{)}$ $\underset{üåè}{\rightarrow}$ $\underset{\color{Red}{a},s}{argmax} U(\color{Green}{\Delta c}, \color{Purple}{\Delta r}, \color{Red}{a}, s\color{white}{)} - \color{Pink}{c(s)} \color{Red}{t}$ $\underset{‚è∞}{\rightarrow}$ $\underset{\color{Red}{a},s,t}{argmax} U(\color{Green}{\Delta c}, \color{Purple}{\Delta r}, \color{Red}{a}, s, t\color{white}{)} - \color{Pink}{c(s,\color{Red}{t}\color{Pink}{)}} \color{Red}{t}$. If system is ergodic (time average equals space average), decision vector (which actions at what timestep) should be equivalent when solving **‚ôªÔ∏è Time-Space (TS) Relaxation Path:** $\underset{\color{Red}{a}}{argmax} U(\color{Green}{\Delta c}, \color{Purple}{\Delta r}, \color{Red}{a}\color{white}{)}$$\underset{‚è∞}{\rightarrow}$ $\underset{\color{Red}{a},t}{argmax} U(\color{Gr}{a}, t\color{white}{)} - \color{Pink}{c(t)} \color{Red}{t}$$\underset{üåè}{\rightarrow}$ $\underset{\color{Red}{a},t,s}{argmax} U(\color{Green}{\Delta c}, \color{Purple}{\Delta r}, \color{Red}{a}, t, s\color{white}{)} - \color{Pink}{c(s,\color{Red}{t}\color{Pink}{)}} \color{Red}{t}$.Of course the system is never ergodic and perhaps some bootstrapping tool that operationalizes the observed distance of outcome of applying different process to given latent information, to gather more information on external world without external reference (more in extending Causal Logic with benchmarking simulation tool to navigate uncertainty from [here](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/23#discussioncomment-10373944)).

These mathematical formulations show how decision optimization evolves from simple action selection to full spatiotemporal optimization. The TS path prioritizes temporal then spatial relaxation, while the ST path reverses this order. Both paths ultimately converge to the same fully relaxed optimization problem, demonstrating the robustness of our framework regardless of the relaxation sequence.

### 3.2 Industry-Specific Decision Patterns

| Component | Digital Industry ("Doer" üèÉ) | Physical Industry ("Thinker" üê¢) | Strategic Implication |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Timing Strategy** | ‚Ä¢ Early optimal point (t ‚âà 1.1)<br>‚Ä¢ Low-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ execution | ‚Ä¢ Later optimal point (t ‚âà 4.9)<br>‚Ä¢ High-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ control | Environmental $\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ determines optimal sampling speed |
| **Value Dynamics** | ‚Ä¢ Rapid early value gain<br>‚Ä¢ Quick plateau | ‚Ä¢ Gradual value accumulation<br>‚Ä¢ Sustained growth | Value curve shapes experimental design |
| **Delay Cost** | ‚Ä¢ Steep $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ slope<br>‚Ä¢ High opportunity cost | ‚Ä¢ Gradual $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ slope<br>‚Ä¢ Lower opportunity cost | Cost structure drives sampling frequency |
| **Value Retention** | ‚Ä¢ Sharp decay post-optimum<br>‚Ä¢ Higher time pressure | ‚Ä¢ Sustained positive value<br>‚Ä¢ Lower time pressure | Time pressure determines strategic flexibility |

### 3.3 Arrow's Replacement Effect Through Vector Speed
Our framework provides a computational foundation for Arrow's replacement effect through the lens of optimal sampling behavior. Incumbents' gradual $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ slopes and lower opportunity costs naturally lead to high-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ control strategies with delayed decision points (t ‚âà 4.9). This matches Arrow's observation that "preinvention monopoly power acts as a strong disincentive to further innovation." Conversely, entrants' steep $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ slopes and high opportunity costs drive low-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ execution strategies with early decisions (t ‚âà 1.1).

This analysis reveals Arrow's replacement effect emerges not just from market structure, but from rational adaptation to different uncertainty ($\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$) and delay cost ($\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$) environments. The apparent "replacement" pattern reflects optimal sampling strategies under different temporal constraints.

###  3.4 Theoretical Integration (todo)

Our vector speed framework unifies three distinct theoretical perspectives on optimal decision-making, all supporting Arrow's replacement effect through different lenses. [[üìústern17_control_exe(ent, strategy)]]'s control-execution trade-off explains why established firms prefer high-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ control strategies: their lower $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ enables upfront investment in future protection. [[üìúgans23_choose(ent, exp)]] experimental choice theory complements this by showing how incumbents rationally choose "high-bar" experiments (minimizing false positives) while entrants prefer "low-bar" experiments (minimizing false negatives) - precisely the pattern our model predicts based on differing $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ structures. Finally, [[üìútenanbaum14_1sample(1decide)]]'s (2014) sample optimization framework provides the cognitive foundation: when samples are costly in time, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions can maximize global returns. This explains why entrants' seemingly "imperfect" low-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ strategies are actually optimal given their steep $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ slopes, while incumbents' deliberate high-$\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ approach reflects their gradual $\color{Pink}{delay \; cost}$ curves - a computational validation of Arrow's classic insight about how market position shapes innovation incentives.
## 4. Future Research Directions (BPUTN Framework)

Our vector-based framework opens five critical dimensions for future research, each addressing distinct aspects of entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty.

### 4.1 Belief Formation (B)
Environmental shocks fundamentally alter the relationship between operational and market success probabilities, shifting the underlying $\color{Green}{p_c}/\color{Purple}{p_r}$ ratio in ways that demand systematic investigation. The emergence of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, for instance, has introduced new uncertainty structures that challenge traditional operational-market balance. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the transportation industry demonstrates how external shocks can rapidly reshape the relative importance of operational efficiency versus market responsiveness. Understanding the rate at which entrepreneurs update their beliefs under such fundamental uncertainty changes becomes crucial for predicting adaptation patterns.

### $\color{SkyBlue}{\text{4.2 Prediction Scenarios (P)}}$
Our analysis reveals three critical prediction scenarios that warrant deeper examination. First, asymmetric uncertainty (P1) emerges when market uncertainty dominates operational uncertainty ($\color{Purple}{\sigma_r} >> \color{Green}{\sigma_c}$), exemplified by the bullwhip effect in semiconductor industries where downstream variability creates reinforcing loops between productivity gains and market growth. Second, time-critical decisions (P2) in fast clockspeed industries introduce large $\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ environments where utility-maximizing actions become perishable, demanding novel approaches to optimal sampling under time pressure. Third, the correlation between operational and market uncertainties (P3), expressed as $\color{Orange}{\text{Corr(} \color{Green}{\sigma_c}, \color{Purple}{\sigma_r}\color{Orange}{\text{)}}}$, shapes optimal vector direction in ways that require formal modeling.

### $\color{Red}{\text{4.3 Utility Mechanisms (U)}}$
Understanding utility mechanisms requires investigating two interconnected dimensions. Market mechanism effects (U1) encompass how different industry structures influence GDP impacts and growth dynamics. Algorithm applications (U2) focus on implementing CGPP strategies that can effectively navigate these market mechanisms while maintaining computational tractability.

### $\color{Orange}{\text{4.4 Timestep Evolution (T)}}$
The evolution of decision frequency depends critically on monitoring and waiting costs. As these costs increase, we observe systematic transitions from Q-systems to P-systems, fundamentally altering how entrepreneurs approach decision-making. This relationship between timestep length and $\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ selection suggests a deeper connection between temporal granularity and uncertainty management strategies.

### 4.5  Freedom of Choices
Ultimately entrepreneurs has freedom as they simultaneously optimize signal subscription strategies, belief parameters (Œ±, Œ≤), $\color{skyblue}{\sigma}$ selection mechanisms, $\color{Red}{\text{utility functions}}$ (choosing between linear and quadratic forms), and $\color{Orange}{\text{timestep}}$ optimization. This multidimensional optimization problem requires novel theoretical approaches that can capture the interdependencies between these various choice dimensions while maintaining analytical tractability.
