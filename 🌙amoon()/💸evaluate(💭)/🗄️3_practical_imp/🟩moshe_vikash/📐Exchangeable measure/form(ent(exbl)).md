# (D) Problem Formulation for Entrepreneurship

🗣️REQUEST4:  A clear, jargon-free formulation of the problem you want to solve in entrepreneurship (both mathematically and verbally, with well developed notation and clear explanation, accompanied by a clear description of what you are modeling and why). Please include a discussion of how exchangeability is to be included, justified, and represented, as well as how and why exchangeability will be a useful, important feature of your model and reflective of the 👀phenomena you wish to model.

- ## Payoff-Centered Description of Moon (2025) Variables

Based on the Knightian Uncertainty framework, here's a payoff-centered description of Moon's key variables:

|Variable|Description|Payoff Relevance|
|---|---|---|
|φ (phi)|Idea's value/market viability (in [0,1])|Determines the probability of success (similar to p in Knightian framework)|
|θ(·)|Implementation strategy|Determines how effectively φ can be exploited (affects payoff magnitude)|
|α|Prior strength parameter|Reflects confidence in prior distribution on φ (similar to size of F in Knightian framework)|
|MVT|Market Viability Test|Direct test of φ at fixed cost cφ, yielding φtrue|
|GMT|Go-to-Market Test|Sample of size n at cost n·cy, updating prior on φ based on outcomes|
|V|Potential venture value|Payoff received if venture succeeds (identical to V in Knightian framework)|
|C|Launch cost|Cost incurred to launch venture (identical to C in Knightian framework)|
|n|Sample size for GMT|Affects information gain and cost of testing|
|y|Binomial outcome of GMT|Observations from n trials, follows Binomial(n, φtrue)|
|µ = a/(a+b)|Prior mean of φ|Expected value of idea's success probability under Beta(a,b) distribution|

The fundamental payoff equation in Moon's model mirrors the Knightian framework:

- Expected payoff from launching: n·φtrue - C
- Expected payoff with GMT: n·(a+n·φtrue)/(a+b+n) - n·cy
- Expected payoff with MVT: n·φtrue - cφ

## Critique of Linear Graphical Representation

Your critique about the linearity in the graphs is insightful. Both figures attempt to represent how uncertainty affects willingness-to-pay (WTP) for experiments, but they differ in how they model uncertainty:

### Analysis of Differences:

1. **Uncertainty Representation**:
    
    - **Figure 3.3 (Knightian)** uses a linear model where uncertainty is represented as a range [p, p̄]. As this range narrows (arrows pointing inward), uncertainty decreases.
    - **Figure 3 (Moon)** suggests a non-linear transformation where priors evolve from "triangle" to "circle" to "square" shapes as α decreases, indicating a more complex relationship between confidence and WTP.
2. **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty Effects**:
    
    - The Knightian model doesn't explicitly separate these types, treating all uncertainty as a distribution range.
    - Moon's model distinguishes between:
        - **Epistemic uncertainty**: Represented by the strength parameter α, which affects the shape of the prior distribution
        - **Aleatoric uncertainty**: Inherent randomness in market outcomes even with perfect knowledge of φ
3. **Impact on WTP Curves**:
    
    - In Figure 3.3, WTP curves are strictly triangular, suggesting a linear relationship between uncertainty and value of information.
    - Moon's model suggests that as α decreases (higher uncertainty), the WTP curve transforms non-linearly - becoming more like a circle or square - which better captures how different uncertainty types affect experimentation value.
4. **Theoretical Implications**:
    
    - The linear model oversimplifies how different types of uncertainty affect decision-making.
    - When epistemic uncertainty dominates (low α), the value of experiments likely follows a flatter, more uniform distribution across a wider range of prior means.
    - When aleatoric uncertainty dominates, the WTP curve should maintain a sharper peak near µ̃ (where µ̃V = C).

This distinction is crucial because epistemic uncertainty can be reduced through experimentation, while aleatoric uncertainty cannot. Moon's non-linear representation better captures how entrepreneurs' WTP for experiments should vary based on the relative proportion of reducible versus irreducible uncertainty they face.

The transformation from triangle to circle to square as α decreases suggests that high uncertainty entrepreneurs value experiments differently than the linear model would predict - they see value in experiments across a broader range of prior means rather than just near the indifference point.

| **1. Statistical Model**              | Introduces main parameters \(\phi\) (market potential) and \(\theta\) (implementation), plus a 3‐option algorithm (no test, test \(\phi\), test \(\phi\times\theta\)). | - **Variables:** \(\phi\sim\mathrm{Beta}\), \(\theta\sim\mathrm{Beta}\); cost terms \(c_\phi\), \(c_{\phi,\theta}\).  <br> - **Algorithm:** Compare \(\Delta E^\phi\), \(\Delta E^{\phi,\theta}\), or do nothing if both negative. | Provides a minimal but general framework for deciding if clarifying only demand vs. also clarifying operational feasibility is worth the added cost.                                                                                                              |
| **2.1 Coffee (Peet’s vs. Starbucks)** | Binary success model capturing whether American consumers want premium coffee (\(\phi\)) and whether a café or bean strategy is well‐executed (\(\theta\)).            | - **Beta–Bernoulli**: \(y=1\) iff \(\phi=1\land\theta=1\).  <br> - **Testing**: \(\Delta E^\phi\) for simple taste tests vs. \(\Delta E^{\phi,\theta}\) for pilot cafés.                                                           | If cost of a pop‐up café (implement test) is high but it resolves big uncertainty, \(\Delta E^{\phi,\theta}\) might exceed \(\Delta E^\phi\). Otherwise, do cheaper surveys first.                                                                                |
| **2.2 EV (Incumbent vs. Entrant)**    | Toyota (incumbent with partial knowledge of \(\phi\)) vs. Tesla (disruptor). Key question: Are incremental tests or bold EV pilot invests worth it?                    | - **Normal–Beta** approach to \(\phi\times\theta\).  <br> - Toyota’s prior on \(\phi\) partly informed by hybrid experience; Tesla invests heavily in \(\theta\).                                                                  | Shows how an established brand’s constraints can lower the incremental value of “idea‐only” tests, whereas a disruptor might find full implementation tests more urgent to outmaneuver incumbents.                                                                |
| **2.3 EV (Entrant vs. Entrant)**      | Better Place vs. Tesla, both new players in a still‐emerging EV market. \(\phi\) is uncertain overall demand; \(\theta\) depends on battery or charging solutions.     | - Both rely on posteriors about consumer adoption + technical feasibility.  <br> - **Algorithm** remains: do no test if cost too high or all payoffs negative, else pick bigger \(\Delta E\).                                      | Illustrates head‐to‐head “Disruptor vs. Disruptor” scenario; if either believes a partial pilot yields crucial synergy info, that test can pay off, but resource constraints may favor simpler tests if \(\Delta E^{\phi}\) outweighs \(\Delta E^{\phi,\theta}\). |
| **3. Implications**                   | Summarizes the cost–information tradeoff, highlighting exchangeability and Bayesian updates as critical in entrepreneurial decisions.                                  | - Testing \(\phi\) alone vs. testing \(\phi\times\theta\) shapes how quickly and precisely beliefs update.  <br> - **Resource constraints** force a “test 2 choose 1” approach.                                                    | Provides practical guidance for founders:  <br>1) If neither test is affordable or beneficial, skip.  <br>2) If clarifying idea cheaply is enough, test \(\phi\).  <br>3) If synergy or big payoff, test \(\phi\times\theta\).                                    |

This structured comparison highlights how the decision framework extends from a **binary success model in coffee** to a **continuous outcome model in EVs**, justifying the transition to a normal distribution in Section 2.2.
## 2.1☕️
## 🌉
While coffee quality perception is often discrete (good vs. bad), decision-making in industries like electric vehicles involves continuous trade-offs, such as battery range, cost, and manufacturing efficiency. EV success depends on **gradual variations in both idea quality (market demand) and implementation effectiveness (cost efficiency, supply chain constraints),** requiring a model that captures **incremental improvements, investment trade-offs, and continuous learning from market signals.** This motivates our shift to a normal distribution framework in Section 2.2, allowing for more nuanced updates and strategic adjustments.

## 2.2🚗




"An entrepreneur can learn about their venture in two ways:
- Test idea quality directly (e.g., customer surveys)
- Test specific implementations (e.g., pilot products)
Each test has a cost, and the entrepreneur needs to decide which testing approach to use."

2. Mathematical Model:

```
Core Setup:
Let y = φ * θ (profitability = idea quality × implementation effectiveness)
where:
φ ∈ {φ_bad, φ_good}     // idea quality
θ ∈ {θ_bad, θ_good}     // implementation effectiveness

Two Testing Options:
1. Test φ directly: Observe φ at cost c_φ
2. Test (φ,θ) pair: Observe y at cost c_y

Key Exchangeability Property:
p(y_1, y_2 | φ) = p(y_2, y_1 | φ)   // order of implementation doesn't affect inferred value of idea quality
```

3. Why Exchangeability Matters:
- Business Reality: Entrepreneurs often test multiple implementations of the same idea's 
- Exchangeability means: Order of testing implemented ideas doesn't affect what we learn about idea quality
- Example: Testing "coffee shop in location A then B" vs "B then A" should give same information about the quality of the core business idea

4. Decision Problem:
```
max_{d∈{test_φ, test_y}} E[V(π)] - c(d)

where:
V(π) = Expected value under belief state π
π(φ,θ|test_φ) = Direct learning about idea
π(φ,θ|test_y) = Indirect learning through implementation
```

5. Key Questions This Answers:
- When should entrepreneurs test idea vs implemented idea?
- How does exchangeability help us learn about idea quality from implemented idea tests?
- How do testing costs affect optimal learning approach?

🫀prior belief (μE) about idea quality + 💰cost ratio of learning idea and profitability distribution (sampling cost ratio) should influence which test you choose: If optimistic (high μE): Do low bar test (test profitability), If pessimistic (low μE): Do high bar test (test idea)

🚨🚨🚨todo3: imagine how [[🗄️ 🧩correlation examples]] relates

Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching ½ of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by “success” is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. “Statistical significance” plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental “cuteness” and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.

### D1. Phenomenon and Purpose

Entrepreneurs often face **two contrasting** domains in product management:

6. **Atom (Physical/Hardware).** Here, founders expect **tight, uniform** performance across products (e.g., identical batteries from a factory). Any deviation (e.g., one battery charging 30 minutes vs. another 45 under the same conditions) signals that the underlying “physical process” is not truly the same—an important discovery for process improvement.
7. **Bit (Software/Behavior/Market Segments).** Here, founders **expect** variation (e.g., how different customer groups adopt a new app). Surprisingly _similar_ outcomes can be the big news (e.g., both “luxury buyers” and “eco-conscious buyers” giving equally high ratings)—revealing an unexpected _common_ acceptance factor.

This duality implies **asymmetric testing**: hardware-like domains benefit from “physics-grade” tight thresholds (Meehl’s “strong tests”), while psychology-like domains risk “crud factor” false positives if we rely solely on a p-value. We aim to integrate **exchangeability** so that the model can systematically handle _when_ items (or data points) should be treated as “essentially the same” versus “likely different.”

$P(X_1 = x_1,\dots, X_n = x_n \mid \theta_{\text{atom}}) \;=\; P\!\bigl(X_{\pi(1)} = x_1,\dots, X_{\pi(n)} = x_n \;\bigm|\; \theta_{\text{atom}}\bigr)$,

as long as all $X_i$ share the same underlying process. **A single surprising deviation** (e.g., a large outlier) can falsify “perfect exchangeability,” prompting the entrepreneur to refine or subdivide the process model.

On the **software/psychological** side, we start with a prior assumption that different market segments $Y_j$ or product variations might _not_ be exchangeable. Instead, we specify a **hierarchical** or **partial-exchangeability** prior:

$(Y_1,\dots, Y_m) \;\sim\; \int p(Y_1,\dots, Y_m \mid \phi)\; dP(\phi)$

where $\phi$ is a higher-level parameter capturing potential commonalities. Observing an unexpected _similarity_ (i.e., data showing that segments are more exchangeable than presumed) is an important revision—akin to discovering a single “core adoption driver” across groups.
