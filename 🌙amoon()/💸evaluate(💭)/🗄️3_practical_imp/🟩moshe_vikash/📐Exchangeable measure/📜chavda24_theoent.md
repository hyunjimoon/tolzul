## **Comparative Table: Theory-Based vs. Practice-Based Entrepreneurial Search**

| **Key Distinction**                               | **üß† Theory-Based Search**                                                             | **ü§ú Practice-Based Search**                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Guiding Principle**                           | Guided by formal hypotheses or conceptual frameworks (theories)                         | Guided by on-the-ground actions, routines, and emergent adaptations                                   |
| **2. Primary Search Approach**                     | Structured, hypothesis-driven tests across multiple domains or markets                  | Iterative, trial-and-error learning driven by local insights, tacit knowledge, and incremental tweaks |
| **3. Role of Large Sample or Data**               | Tends to rely on broader, more systematic data (e.g., ‚Äúbig‚Äù samples such as Amazon‚Äôs)    | Often works with smaller, situation-specific data; draws on direct practice in local contexts         |
| **4. How Learning Updates Occur**                  | Learns globally via formal updating (akin to hierarchical Bayesian: pooling across many) | Learns locally; each new venture or action is treated as a distinct experiment with limited pooling   |
| **5. Overfitting/Underfitting Trade-off**          | More emphasis on generalizable findings; risk is missing local nuances (underfitting)    | More emphasis on local fit, but risk of being siloed or ignoring global patterns (overfitting)        |
| **6. Example Contexts**                            | Large platforms systematically testing new ideas (e.g., A/B testing at scale)            | Small-scale entrepreneurs iterating prototypes and pivoting based on direct feedback                  |
| **7. Relation to Hierarchical Modeling**           | Naturally maps onto multilevel models: each idea/venture is partially pooled via a global theory | May not explicitly pool across contexts; tends to treat each action as unique unless aggregated later |

This table encapsulates how **Theory-Based Entrepreneurial Search** (left column) naturally aligns with the **hierarchical Bayesian** perspective from ‚ÄúModels With Memory,‚Äù pooling evidence systematically from many contexts. In contrast, **Practice-Based Search** (right column) learns from smaller, direct experiments and is less likely to use an aggregate theory across multiple data clusters‚Äîthough it can still benefit from partial-pooling ideas when insights from different local experiments must eventually be combined.
