Measuring and Managing Entrepreneurial Ecosystems • Entrepreneurship and the National Systems of Innovation • Measuring Entrepreneurship: From Small Firms to Young Firms • The Startup Cartography Project • Assessing the Impact of Institutions and Policies in Entrepreneurial Ecosystems

A Simple Model of Entrepreneurial Quality• Firm quality: 𝑞 ∈ (0, ∞) observable to the entrepreneur but not the analyst • Corporate Governance: The entrepreneur chooses a set of 𝑁 governance options 𝐻 = ℎ1, … , ℎ𝑁 , ℎ𝑖 ∈ 0,1 • Growth outcome: 𝑔𝑠 is a measure of performance observable (by the firm and analyst) 𝑠 years after founding, 𝑔𝑠 ∈ 0,1 • Under intuitive assumptions on the relationship between q, H, and g, E(H*) is (weakly) increasing in q

measuring vision + ambition + capability

Estimation of Entrepreneurial QualityConsider a mapping 𝑓−1 𝑔| 𝐻 → 𝜃 which estimates the probability of growth for a given bundle, H. Proposition #2: 𝐸 𝜃 𝑖𝑠 𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑙𝑦 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝑞 𝑓−1 𝑔| 𝐻 → 𝜃 identifies a monotonic function of q

Two Key Insights • If corporate governance choices H satisfy the SCP (i.e., a separating equilibrium for each corporate governance choice), then early corporate governance choices are signals of the underlying θ • The mapping from governance choices to growth outcomes allows us to recover the probability of growth, conditional on corporate governance choices (but NOT a causal interpretation on h’s)

Data Coverage Total observations: 38,506,776. 1988 to 2014: All firms registered in 49 US states (excluding Delaware) and Washington D.C. 2014 to 2016: 46 states (excluding Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, South Carolina) These states account for 99.6% of US GDP in 2014

What is the impact of entrepreneurial quantity and quality on subsequent economic performance and social progress?

The Startup Cartography Project Built around two principles: • Measurement of Entrepreneurial Quality: • Using predictive analytics and business registration records • Apply the ‘Entrepreneurial Quality’ approach developed at MIT to account for the vast differences between different types of firms. • User Focused Design: 1. Visualization of entrepreneurial ecosystems (at multiple geographic levels) and an ability to track entrepreneurial dynamics over time. 2. Data repository for use in a wide range of research and policy purposes. 3. Research archive to learn about entrepreneurial quality
