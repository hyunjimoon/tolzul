[[atom(abcd_t)]] framework is explained using case studies from Sergey's master thesis.
- `atom_supply (a)`: fulfillment supply chain, manufacturing, contracts / operational capability
- `bit_supply (b)`:  capability supply chain, strategy, technology, organization, network, talent ecosystem / operational capability
- `customer (c)`:  sampled from `d` and has experimenter's bias, adopters
	- survey skill
	- need elicitation skill
- `demand (d)` : can be developed with slower clockspeed (facebook metaverse), potential adopters

- score (good, bad) and focus order (1,2,3)

Q1. order of ⚡️anwell: g1, g2,? how well did they manage `atom_supply`? with `atom_supply` and `bit_supply` both good, can they chill about `customer` (as they can pivot)?
Q2. does chosen component (`atom_supply`,`bit_supply`,`customer`,`demand`) to nail first, determine `tech push vs market pull` after? 
- anwell chose to focus on manufacturing and R&D capabilities (`bit_supply`) and became tech push (hence kept pivot)
- bgi chose to build capabilities then found markets (tech push)
Q3. was ministry of supply able to success, in spite of bad `atom_supply`, due to its good `bit_supply`  and `customer` ("core capability on advanced material and innovative product design")?


### didn't scale well
- novaconfort: bad `atom_supply`, `bit_supply` (nail, no scale)
