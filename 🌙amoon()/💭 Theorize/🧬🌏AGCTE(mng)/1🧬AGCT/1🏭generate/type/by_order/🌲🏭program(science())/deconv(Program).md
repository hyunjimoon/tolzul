#operator Inverse of [[Operator Convolute()]]

Random Variable and Independence
I wish to verify the following thm. with Susie:

i) 
> #RandomVariable" is [[Operator Convolute()]] (a.k.a. lifting or convexifier[^1]) which maps unordered to ordered i.e. lifting to the fullest #independence system. 

Tangled time means circuit.

ii) whehether i) can be paraphrased as following:
> "random variable" is a reconstruction map from pre-matroid to matroid.

iii) seek the role of "independence" w.r.t random variable and matroid.
> Independent random variable is matroid-making map. what is (S, I)?

Independence is related to weak existence or #copy and associated with orthogonal image

> The Mebius invariant $\mu$, essential to the classification of surfaces, is less useful in the study of exchange geometries (matroids) because it undergoes sizeable fluctuations as a result of minor structural changes, such as the lengthening of an arc. The number $\beta$, investigated here, is not only a geometric invariant, like $\mu$, but is also a duality invariant, and provides a complete determination of separability.
