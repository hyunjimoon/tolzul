Platform collaboration with pull, pool, push strategy
- pull: invest infrastructure (solar power), educate, 
- pool: information 
- push: separate (treat differently; acute and chronic)
- nation is platform for business and individual, business is platform for individual (order of capacity to endure worse then better dynamic)
- trust-building atomization
- test and update atomization (build balance loop, feature)
