### ## Architect vs. Analyst

An **entrepreneur** acts as an **architect of a proposition**, generatively designing the very structure of uncertainty they present to the world. Their goal is to craft a compelling hypothesis—the venture itself—by strategically choosing its ambition and precision to persuade stakeholders. In contrast, an **experimenter** acts as an **analyst of a procedure**, methodologically designing a process to reduce inferential uncertainty about a pre-existing hypothesis. Their goal is to ensure the reliability of their conclusion through procedural rigor, such as setting the sample size and using controls. The entrepreneur creates the _what_ to be tested; the experimenter perfects the _how_ of testing it.

### ## Proposition vs. Procedure

- A **proposition** is the _substance_ of the claim. It is a strategic statement of value with designed ambiguity, like a venture's promise. Its quality is judged by its ability to attract belief and resources.
    
- A **procedure** is the _methodology_ for testing a claim. It is a rigorous sequence of actions designed to produce a reliable measurement or conclusion. Its quality is judged by its objectivity, replicability, and statistical power.
