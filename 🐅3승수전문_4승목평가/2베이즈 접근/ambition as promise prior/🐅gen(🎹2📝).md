### Session 1: Framework Alignment and Korean Translation
- **Key pattern discovered**: Strong consistency across all theoretical documents (Marr3lev, Scale, Theory) with unified Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ) framework and matching empirical cases
- **Implementation completed**: Translated Abstract and Conclusion sections to Korean; added structured tables to all 4 Korean module files following the prescribed format
- **Next step identified**: Deepen theoretical analysis incorporating committee perspectives (Charlie's operations lens, Scott's Bayesian entrepreneurship, Vikash's probabilistic programming)

[[2025-08-22|Progress Report #5 2025-08-22]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Major consistency issues between Marr's levels, Scale framework, and main theory document - terminology mismatch (Bayesian jargon vs plain English), mathematical notation inconsistencies, and insufficient committee member expertise integration
- **Implementation made**: Created management science draft following update plan - cut jargon, added plain English propositions (P1-P4), locked in key figures (Financial Tightrope, Learning Trap heatmap), aligned with committee strengths (Charlie's operations, Scott's Bayesian frameworks, Vikash's probabilistic programming)
- **Next step identified**: Develop specific figures based on attached visualization example, ensure committee member value propositions clearly addressed, validate mathematical formulations across all documents

[[2025-08-14|Progress Report #4 2025-08-14]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Literature review must mirror methodological progression through constraints—from baseline (promises matter?) through finance (self-fulfilling power) to physics (operational bounds) to flexibility (learning requirements) to precision (information costs)
- **Implementation made**: Restructured literature into constraint-aligned sections (2.1-2.5) that build toward Beta(μ,τ) framework, emphasizing entrepreneurial priors as future-oriented social coordination devices that reverse temporal causality
- **Next step identified**: Draft methodology section showing how each model reveals constraints through mathematical progression: deterministic (M1) → linear (M2) → multiplicative (M3) → distributional (M4) → cost-optimized (M5)

[[2025-08-14|Progress Report #3 2025-08-14]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Literature streams converge on uncertainty architecture—from operations (existence before efficiency), decision science (belief-value co-evolution), to entrepreneurship theory (social priors as coordination devices)
- **Implementation made**: Created comprehensive literature table organizing 30+ citations by theoretical frameworks, showing how promise architecture unifies disparate streams through Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ) formalization
- **Next step identified**: Develop empirical methodology section detailing how to extract (μ,τ) from natural language promises and validate against venture outcomes

[[2025-08-13|Progress Report #2 2025-08-13]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: The evolution from promise-level (φ) to belief-structure (μ,τ) design reveals precision as universal constraint creating both operational failure and fraud through identical mathematical mechanisms
- **Implementation made**: Drafted unified management science paper bridging operations-strategy divide through four constraint architecture (physics, finance, flexibility, precision) that resonates with all committee perspectives
- **Next step identified**: Formalize Model 4's learning trap mathematics showing |μ(t+1)-μ(t)| > ε/(τ+1) requirement and extract (μ,τ) trajectories from Tesla/Nikola public communications

[[2025-08-12|Progress Report #1 2025-08-12]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Academic writing style requires complete sentences with subordinate clauses that pack theoretical density while maintaining logical flow through careful use of em-dashes and colons
- **Implementation made**: Updated Marr's 3-level and Scale files to incorporate formal mathematical notation (μ, τ, φ) with rigorous definitions and explicit functional forms like d(φ) = (1-φ)ⁿ
- **Next step identified**: Develop fuller mathematical appendix showing derivations of optimal τ* = max(0, [(V_sd - V_snd)μ(1-μ)/c] - 1)
