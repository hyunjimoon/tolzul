First, the committee recognizes that you invested a huge amount of effort into this paper.  The payoff is that the committee believes that there is a kernel of an idea in the paper that is important and meaningful to entrepreneurs and to the operations/entrepreneurship literature.  The work has also earned praise for capturing and analyzing the tradeoff you identified in a straightforward model, and that the Tesla/BetterPlace example provides a helpful, concrete illustration of the issue you wish to highlight.

However, numerous concerns were also expressed, including:

1.  The literature review is quite inadequate and doesn’t do a good job of placing the paper in the contracting/experimentation literature or the operations literature. 

2.  The introduction is also weak and doesn’t communicate well what the paper will contribute.  

3.  Qualitatively, the results are not particularly surprising.  Where is the “aha” and core contribution?  To deliver on this, you would need a much more fine-grained review of the literature, identify what has and hasn’t been done in adjacent papers (e.g., Bolton, et al, and others), and then slot in your contribution.  But, you would also need results that would likely influence the thinking of others who have worked in this space.  
> I'm persuading charlie the language "bayesian entrepreneurship" has potential to include the "menus" portion of "operations for entrepreneurs". The idea of bayesian computation and sampling algorithms are what I've been using to introduce 


4.  The paper does not show an appreciation of what constitutes a PhD-level contribution the field.  The paper is stronger than an undergraduate paper, but below the bar of what is expected for doctoral work.  The abstract claims "contributions to both theory and practice" which seems grandiose relative to what is delivered, especially given the absence of any empirical support for the theory.  Also, the writing is self-referential and playful in surprising ways that seem "out of genre" for an academic paper, e.g. "Given the bold and precise promise of this paper, we plan to pay for precision as follows.”
> disagree with the self-referential and playful -> the two are what i recognize as a sign of intelligence so i can't help including them. i.e. it's my faith to let the paper be the first user of its invention (self-referential) and contain inconsistency (playful)

5.  Overall, the paper is well below the bar of what is expected.  One path to get over the bar might be to use the baseline model in some interesting/creative way, develop the literature in a precise way that characterizes the "contribution" clearly, and elaborate on potential empirical predictions that could be validated (at least in principle) with data.

# GPT Summary (what the paper does and claims)

The manuscript offers a formal theory of **entrepreneurial promise design**—how founders should choose both the _level_of aspiration and the _precision_ (specificity) of what they promise when success requires (i) selling the promise to secure resources and (ii) ultimately delivering it. The core ideas are:

- Treat “deliverability” as a prior constraint on “sellability.” With increasing **operational complexity** nn, bolder promises become exponentially harder to deliver, so the optimal aspiration falls as nn rises (baseline result: ϕ\*=1/(n+1)ϕ\*=1/(n+1)).
    
- Treat **precision** ττ as an endogenous choice rather than a fixed requirement. High early precision creates a **learning trap** (posterior mean hard to move), so ventures should “pay for precision” gradually via verification.
    
- Provide a reduced-form cost of precision C(τ)=cln⁡(τ+1)C(τ)=cln(τ+1) to derive a joint optimum (μ\*,τ\*)= ⁣(1n+1,max⁡{0,Vnc(n+1)2−1})(μ\*,τ\*)=(n+11​,max{0,c(n+1)2Vn​−1}).
    
- Use Tesla vs. Better Place as an illustrative contrast: flexible early promises with staged verification vs. precise early promises that proved rigid. 
    

# Topline assessment relative to a “Management Science” bar

**Big picture:** The paper pursues an important and under-theorized question at the interface of entrepreneurship, economics, and operations: _how to design uncertainty itself_. The angle—optimizing aspiration and precision jointly—has novelty and practical resonance.

**Strengths**

- Clear, decision-analytic framing that can unify disparate intuitions (signaling, persuasion, reliability/complexity, learning/flexibility).
    
- Clean, teachable comparative statics (ϕ\*=1/(n+1)ϕ\*=1/(n+1); precision rises with V/cV/c and falls with nn).
    
- Potential to generate falsifiable predictions (e.g., early numerical specificity vs. pivot capacity vs. survival).
    

**Gaps to close for a premier outlet**

1. **Microfoundations and identification:** Some functional forms (e.g., p(ϕ)=ϕp(ϕ)=ϕ, d(ϕ)=(1−ϕ)nd(ϕ)=(1−ϕ)n, C(τ)=cln⁡(τ+1)C(τ)=cln(τ+1)) are convenient but feel ad hoc. A stronger microfoundation will be expected.
    
2. **Equilibrium with audiences:** Investors, customers, and regulators are strategic. The model is essentially single-agent. A high-end journal will want a game-theoretic treatment (or at least robustness checks) where audiences anticipate overpromising and penalize it.
    
3. **Dynamic path of (μt,τt)(μt​,τt​):** The theory is essentially static with comparative statics on ττ. A dynamic program (staged investment/verification, reputation, financing frictions) will markedly raise the contribution.
    
4. **Measurement & empirical validation:** To clear the bar, you’ll need either (a) a field or natural experiment, (b) a large-scale empirical study with credible measures of “precision,” “aspiration,” and “complexity,” or (c) a lab/online experiment that manipulates precision and aspiration and measures sellability, learning, and pivoting.
    
5. **Positioning within established literatures:** The connections to Bayesian persuasion, reliability/complexity, real options, entrepreneurial experimentation, and product-development/OM need to be explicit and technically integrated (not just cited).
    

# Detailed critique and suggestions

## 1) Modeling primitives and microfoundations

- **Sellability p(ϕ)p(ϕ)** as linear in promise level is too strong. Consider (i) an S-shaped demand/funding response (logit), (ii) decreasing returns to boldness, and (iii) an _ex ante_ penalty for perceived hype (audiences anticipate bias). These alternatives may preserve the interior optimum but yield richer comparative statics.
    
- **Deliverability d(ϕ)=(1−ϕ)nd(ϕ)=(1−ϕ)n** implicitly assumes nn independent, series-system “miracles” with identical sensitivity to boldness. Provide a reliability-style microfoundation: d(ϕ)=∏i=1nqi(ϕ)d(ϕ)=∏i=1n​qi​(ϕ), where qi′(ϕ)<0qi′​(ϕ)<0, and show that if qiqi​ are affine or log-concave, you still get ϕ\* ⁣≈1/(n+1)ϕ\*≈1/(n+1). This both grounds and generalizes Proposition 2.
    
- **Precision cost C(τ)=cln⁡(τ+1)C(τ)=cln(τ+1)** implies _declining_ marginal cost of added precision, which is counterintuitive for many technologies. Either (a) provide a microfoundation (e.g., each verification adds a pseudo-count at roughly constant cost → ττ is additive and costs are linear in increments, but the _value_ of variance reduction is concave), or (b) explore a convex alternative (e.g., C(τ)=κτα,α ⁣> ⁣1C(τ)=κτα,α>1). Show which qualitative results survive.
    
- **Consistency of notation:** Early models use ϕϕ (promise), later sections use μμ as the Beta mean. Make the mapping explicit (e.g., ϕ≡μϕ≡μ) and keep it invariant throughout. Add a clear table of symbols and units.
    

## 2) Learning, “precision,” and flexibility

- The **learning-trap** condition μ(1−μ)/(τ+1)<ϵμ(1−μ)/(τ+1)<ϵ uses change in posterior mean after a failure as a proxy for flexibility. Consider more principled measures: (i) **posterior variance** (effective sample size), (ii) **expected value of sample information** (EVSI), or (iii) **mutual information** of the verification signal. Show monotone links to ττ and derive thresholds without relying on a specific ϵϵ.
    
- Clarify the **mechanism of paying for precision**: model a choice of milestone experiments that increase ττ by adding pseudo-counts (evidence). This creates a natural budget constraint and connects to staged finance.
    
- Consider **endogenous evidence credibility**: some evidence is verifiable (certifications, trials), some is soft (slideware). Tie precision to verifiability (Grossman–Milgrom unraveling logic) and show when ventures optimally disclose vs. remain ambiguous.
    

## 3) Multi-player and dynamic extensions

- **Two-sided optimization (entrepreneur vs. investor/customer):** Investors set funding terms anticipating delivery risk; customers form expectations and may penalize misses (reputation). A simple Stackelberg or Bayesian persuasion extension would strengthen external validity.
    
- **Dynamic path (μt,τt)(μt​,τt​)** with carry-over reputation and cash constraints. Solve a two-period or finite-horizon DP to show (i) start vague, buy precision once evidence passes a threshold; (ii) optimal “promise ramps” under capital scarcity; (iii) how penalties for misses (legal or reputational) shrink the feasible region.
    
- **When bolder promises _raise_ deliverability:** In some environments, ambitious promises attract talent/partners that _increase_ success probabilities (network externalities). Model qi(ϕ)qi​(ϕ) as non-monotone (Inverted-U). Characterize parameter regions where ambition pays because it crowds in complementary resources.
    

## 4) Empirical strategy and testable predictions

_What to measure:_

- **Aspiration**: degree to which claims exceed incumbent benchmarks in external communications (press releases, pitch decks, product pages).
    
- **Precision**: share of numeric/point claims, presence of exact deadlines, digits reported, ranges vs. point estimates.
    
- **Complexity nn**: count of critical subsystems (tech, regulatory, supply-chain), TRLs of each, architectural coupling (e.g., product modularity or NK-style ruggedness proxies).
    
- **Outcomes**: fundraising success, pivot frequency, delivery slippage, product-market fit timing, survival.
    

_Designs to consider:_

- **Field/archival:** Text-mine startup disclosures at seed/Series A, link to outcomes 3–7 years later. Instrument precision using exogenous shocks to verification costs (e.g., regulatory testing queue length, certification fee changes) or sector norms.
    
- **Field experiment:** With incubators/accelerators, randomize _how_ teams are instructed to phrase promises (precise vs. directional; early verification milestones vs. none) and follow funding/pivot outcomes.
    
- **Lab/online experiment:** Randomize promise frames to investor-participants; measure funding offers and posterior beliefs; allow staged evidence to “buy” precision and measure updating.
    

_Predictions:_

1. U-shaped hazard of failure in early precision: too vague → underfunded; too precise → rigid and brittle.
    
2. Interaction V/cV/c: where verification is cheap or value high, optimal precision rises earlier.
    
3. As nn increases, optimal aspiration and precision decline; overshooting either predicts fewer pivots and worse survival.
    

## 5) Exposition and writing

- Tighten the **Tesla vs. Better Place** narrative and add citations for every factual claim (dates, ranges, funding, station counts). Avoid numbers that could be contested without sources.
    
- Replace rhetorical flourishes with **concise definitions, assumptions, and propositions**. Move stories to a short motivating example; keep proofs in an appendix.
    
- Add **figures**: (i) sellability vs. deliverability tradeoff; (ii) heatmap of optimal (μ,τ)(μ,τ) over nn and V/cV/c; (iii) learning capacity as a function of ττ for different μμ.
    
- Remove “TODO” markers and unify references (years, venues) to top-tier standards.
    

# Concrete “revise & extend” plan (what to do next)

1. **Re-specify primitives and prove robustness**:
    
    - Replace p(ϕ)=ϕp(ϕ)=ϕ with a logit; replace d(ϕ)d(ϕ) with ∏qi(ϕ)∏qi​(ϕ); test convex C(τ)C(τ). Prove interior optima persist and state comparative statics cleanly.
        
2. **Add a short two-period dynamic model**:
    
    - Period 1: choose (μ1,τ1)(μ1​,τ1​), invest k(Δτ)k(Δτ), get signal; Period 2: update and choose (μ2,τ2)(μ2​,τ2​). Show thresholds for “buying precision” and characterize optimal ramping.
        
3. **Introduce an audience**:
    
    - Simple investor who sets a funding cutoff anticipating misreporting. Show how penalties for misses change optimal (μ,τ)(μ,τ) and can rationalize sector-specific norms.
        
4. **Design the empirical component** (one strong study or two complementary ones), pre-specify measures, and align each prediction to a test.
    
5. **Reposition contributions**:
    
    - 🌙“We endogenize both the _content_ and the _fidelity_ of entrepreneurial claims, unifying persuasion, reliability, and staged experimentation in a single optimization problem.”🌙

# Bottom line

You have a compelling unifying idea and several elegant, managerially resonant prescriptions. To meet a _Management Science_ bar, I recommend (i) stronger microfoundations and robustness for primitives, (ii) at least a two-period dynamic extension with an audience, and (iii) a credible empirical design (or a clean experiment) that operationalizes _aspiration_, _precision_, and _complexity_. With those additions—and tighter exposition—this can become a distinctive contribution at the intersection of entrepreneurship, economics, and operations.
