## System Model for Mental Discovery (Decision, Global)
### 1. Discover
- problems of maintenance

## Statistical Model for Computation (Draws, Local)
### 2. Infer-Predict-Generate

## System Model for Mental Discovery (Decision, Global)
### 3. Act

|    | Math               | Mental          |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------- |
|     | Differentiation    | global to local |
|     | Integration        | local to global |
|     | rate               | absolute scale  |
|     | ratio              | relative scale  |
|     | prior distribution | prior knowledge |

With the action of Policying - Estimate - Analyze - Decide, we reach the state of Policy - Estimation - Anslysis - Decision. 

System and subsystem are relative but we often call them global and local. Between the parent-child in the hierarchy we use  decompose and interger
