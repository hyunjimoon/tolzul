Prolonged indecision in the face of market volatility can be detrimental to the startup's survival and growth prospects.                                                                                            | In an unstable market, such as during a global pandemic or significant regulatory changes, a biotech startup developing a COVID-19 vaccine may take longer to pivot to a different product or market segment. The instability in the market may require the startup to gather more data, assess the changing landscape, and adapt their strategies before making a pivoting decision. In contrast, in a stable market, the startup may be able to make quicker decisions based on clear market signals and trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | In an unstable market, a biotech startup developing a novel drug for a rare disease may quickly pivot to a more promising market segment if the initial target market experiences significant disruptions or regulatory hurdles. The rapid changes in the market landscape may prompt the startup to swiftly reallocate resources and adapt its strategy to ensure survival and capitalize on emerging opportunities in alternative market segments.                                                                                                                                                          | Gans et al.

The larger market size offers higher potential revenues and allows for larger sample sizes in clinical trials, which may encourage the startup to persist longer in this segment before considering a pivot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A biotech startup targeting a large market segment, such as developing a new type of insulin for diabetes management, may pivot more quickly to a different market segment if they face intense competition from established players. The presence of multiple competitors in the large market may pressure the startup to differentiate itself rapidly or risk losing market share, thereby prompting a faster pivot to an alternative segment where it can establish a stronger competitive position.                                                                                                       | Bhide (1994) discusses how entrepreneurs craft strategies that work, which may involve persisting in larger markets with higher potential revenues, as suggested by the hypothesis.<br>Hsieh (2010) presents a case study of Zappos, where the company persisted in the large online shoe retail market despite challenges, aligning with the idea of startups taking longer to pivot in bigger markets.                                                                                          | Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf (2016) discuss financing entrepreneurial experimentation, which may be more readily available in larger markets, enabling startups to pivot faster.<br>Cohen et al. (2019) study the role of accelerator designs in mitigating bounded rationality in new ventures, suggesting that the support and resources provided by accelerators may help startups pivot more quickly in larger, competitive markets.                                                                                                   |
| BR: belief and real gap<br><br>(optimism)               | HIGHER BR, LONGER T2CS<br>**Hypothesis BR2T2CS:** The larger the gap between belief and real market conditions, the longer the time to pivot.<br><br>**Rationale:** When there is a significant discrepancy between the startup's beliefs and the actual market conditions, it may take longer for the startup to gather enough evidence to challenge their assumptions and make the decision to pivot. The larger the gap, the more experiments and data points are needed to bridge the difference and trigger a pivot.      | HIGHER BR, SHORTER T2CS<br>**Hypothesis BR2T2CS:** The larger the gap between belief and real market conditions, the shorter the time to pivot.<br><br>**Rationale:** When faced with a significant discrepancy between expectations and reality, startups may be more inclined to pivot quickly to minimize further losses and realign their strategy with actual market conditions. A larger gap may serve as a strong signal that a change in direction is necessary, prompting a faster pivot.                                                           | A biotech startup may initially believe that there is a high demand for a new type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for treating solid tumors. However, if the actual market demand is lower than expected or if the development of the ADC faces unexpected scientific challenges, there will be a gap between the startup's beliefs and reality. In this case, the startup may need more time and experiments to validate their assumptions, potentially leading to a longer time to pivot to a different approach or market segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A biotech startup may have a strong belief in the potential of their novel gene editing technology for treating a specific genetic disorder. However, if clinical trials reveal that the therapy is less effective than anticipated or faces unexpected safety concerns, the large gap between the startup's initial optimism and the actual market reception may prompt them to pivot quickly to a different application of their technology or a new therapeutic area altogether, in order to minimize further resource investment in an underperforming direction.                                         | Agrawal et al. (2021) discuss how entrepreneurs choose among alternative visions for their ideas and companies, which may involve taking longer to pivot when there is a larger gap between their beliefs and reality, as they seek to validate their assumptions.<br>Camuffo et al. (2020) show how a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision-making involves testing and updating beliefs, suggesting that larger belief-reality gaps may require more experimentation before pivoting. | Jiang & Liu (2019) explore the impact of managerial optimism on competition and firm outcomes, which may prompt startups to pivot faster when faced with a large discrepancy between their optimistic beliefs and actual market conditions.<br>Astebro et al. (2014) discuss insights from behavioral economics on entrepreneurship, including the potential for entrepreneurs to adjust their beliefs and strategies more quickly when confronted with strong evidence contradicting their initial optimism.                      |
| DB: Diffuseness of prior belief<br><br>(confidence)<br> | HIGHER DB, LONGER T2CS (CHOOSE ONE)<br>**Hypothesis DB2T2CS:** The more confident (or diffused) the prior belief, the longer the startup will adhere to the chosen market segment before considering a pivot.<br><br>**Rationale:** Higher confidence in initial beliefs leads to resistance against changing these beliefs despite new evidence. Startups with strong initial convictions require more substantial proof to reconsider their strategic direction, thereby prolonging the decision-making process.<br><br><br> | HIGHER DB, SHORTER T2CS<br>**Hypothesis DB2T2CS:** The more uncertain (or diffused) the prior belief, the shorter the startup will adhere to the chosen market segment before considering a pivot.<br><br>**Rationale:** Higher uncertainty in initial beliefs leads to more openness to changing these beliefs based on new evidence. Startups with weaker initial convictions require less substantial proof to reconsider their strategic direction, thereby shortening the decision-making process.                                                      | - A biotech startup focusing on developing a novel gene therapy for a rare genetic disorder (Dravet syndrome) may stick with this market segment longer if there is high uncertainty about the therapy's efficacy and market potential. They may conduct more preclinical to gather evidence and reduce uncertainty before considering a pivot to a different therapeutic area or indication.<br><br>- A biotech startup that has invested heavily in the development of a particular drug based on strong initial evidence might delay pivoting, even in the face of emerging research that suggests limited efficacy. Their high confidence in the original research and commitment to the drug's potential may make them less responsive to new, contradictory information, thus extending the time needed to reassess their market strategy and possibly pivot to alternative treatments. | A biotech startup with a novel drug delivery platform may have a diffused prior belief about which therapeutic area to target. As they gather more evidence from market research and scientific studies, they may quickly pivot to a specific disease area that shows the most promise for their technology, as their initial uncertainty allows for more flexibility in adapting their strategy based on new information.

This financial cushion allows them to gather more comprehensive data before deciding whether to pivot to a different drug candidate or therapeutic area. In contrast, a startup with limited capital may need to make pivoting decisions earlier based on a smaller set of experimental results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A well-funded biotech startup developing a novel gene therapy may be able to simultaneously test its application in multiple rare genetic disorders. With the financial resources to conduct parallel experiments, the startup can quickly gather evidence on the therapy's efficacy across different indications. This approach allows the startup to rapidly identify the most promising target market and pivot accordingly, as they can compare results from multiple experiments and make a data-driven decision in a shorter timeframe.                                                                 | Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf (2016) discuss how financing entrepreneurial experimentation allows startups to gather more evidence before making pivoting decisions, supporting the hypothesis.<br>Manso (2016) explores the relationship between experimentation and the returns to entrepreneurship, suggesting that higher capital enables startups to conduct more experiments and take longer to pivot.                                                                                               | Kerr et al.
