Recent empirical literature describes an industry’s clockspeed as a measure of the evolutionary life cycle, which captures the dynamic nature of the industry. Among other factors, the rate of new product development is found to be associated with an industry’s clockspeed. Yet the notion of an industry clockspeed and the essential factors driving suitable decision making in this area have remained relatively unexplored. We develop a simple deﬁnition and a corresponding analytic model which explains the interdependent relationship between a ﬁrm’s own new product development activities and an industry clockspeed. Results from the single ﬁrm model show the conditions under which particular ﬁrms have an incentive to accelerate their new product development activities. Moreover, we link the single ﬁrm’s NPD clockspeed decisions to the industry level by creating appropriate metrics which characterize different types of industries. Examples from high-tech industries such as the personal computer and aerospace industries are included to illustrate our ﬁndings. Our intention is not only to offer analytical insights into factors driving the clockspeed for these industries, but also to establish a fundamental structured decision making approach, thereby stimulating future research on this important topic.
