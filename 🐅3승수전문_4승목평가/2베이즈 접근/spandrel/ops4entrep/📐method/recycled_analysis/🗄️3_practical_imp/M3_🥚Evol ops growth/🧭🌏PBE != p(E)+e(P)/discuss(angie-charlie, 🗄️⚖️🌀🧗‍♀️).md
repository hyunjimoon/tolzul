Theorem: Exchangeability Verification Let X1..Xn be a sequence of observations from entrepreneurial experiments. Observations are exchangeable if and only if their joint probability distribution satisfies the following condition for any permutation : P(X1,X2,…,Xn)=P(Xπ(1),Xπ(2),…,Xπ(n)). This states that the joint probability distribution of observations remains invariant under any permutation π.This property implies the existence of a latent variable such that: This indicates that exchangeability implies the existence of a latent variable θ governing the distribution of the observations. Proof: By de Finetti's theorem, if are exchangeable, there exists a latent variable θ governing the probability distribution of the observations. This decomposition demonstrates that verifying exchangeability is both necessary and sufficient for identifying latent structures that enable systematic learning. ¬ ¬Ironing Out Path Dependencies with Bayesian Statistics Path dependencies in entrepreneurship arise when early choices and unforeseen events irreversibly shape a venture’s trajectory, constraining subsequent strategic options (Gans et al., 2019; Murray, 2004). Path-dependent processes reflect how entrepreneurs, once committed to certain courses of action, become increasingly anchored to them as new knowledge and capabilities emerge (Alvarez et al., 2020; Nelson & Winter, 1982). Incorporating Bayesian statistics into entrepreneurial decision-making frameworks provides a systematic way to acknowledge and adjust for these evolving opportunities and constraints over time. Specifically, Bayesian entrepreneurship introduces two key updating mechanisms. First, Reverse Bayesianism describes how entrepreneurs update their belief distributions as they gain awareness of previously unknown contingencies, proportionally adjusting probabilities of known options (Karni, 2013; Karni & Safra, 2017; Camuffo, 2023). Second, the Hypothesis-Testing Model allows for the updating of higher-level priors when entrepreneurs encounter low-probability events that challenge established assumptions (Ortoleva, 2012; Karni & Safra, 2022). By continuously refining their beliefs, entrepreneurs can strategically navigate emerging constraints, effectively “ironing out” the path dependencies that accumulate as opportunities unfold. This Bayesian lens aligns naturally with how Bayesian statistics in strategy models essential heterogeneity (Mackey, 2024), addressing a fundamental paradox in management research. Traditional methods, such as instrumental variables or treatment effects models, implicitly assume that an entrepreneur’s capability to pursue an opportunity is uncorrelated with strategic choices. This presupposition contradicts the inherently path-dependent and often irreversible nature of entrepreneurial ventures, wherein capabilities and choices co-evolve. In reality, entrepreneurs must simultaneously discover unforeseen contingencies, update their probability assessments, and then commit to actions whose consequences may be difficult or impossible to reverse (Gans et al., 2019). Hierarchical Bayesian approaches embrace this complexity. Rather than artificially partitioning execution capability from opportunity quality, they integrate both into a unified probabilistic model of learning and action. As entrepreneurs engage in what Camuffo (2023) calls “methodic doubt,” they repeatedly question their current models, incorporate new signals about feasibility and desirability, and realign their strategies accordingly. Through Bayesian updating, entrepreneurs avoid becoming trapped in path dependencies; instead, they adaptively recalibrate their beliefs and decisions. This process acknowledges irreversibility as part of the entrepreneurial condition and uses it as a catalyst for continuous learning, ensuring that strategic paths remain open to revision as more evidence accumulates.

With regard to the Word doc you attached.  I think it is useful in addressing the path dependence issue,  However, I do not believe that it makes the case that Bayesian approaches negate the irreversibility of path dependence.  I agree that a Sharp Bayesian Entrepreneur (SBE) can observe and learn quickly, but still cannot reverse history.   Let’s suppose our SBE has $1M in venture capital and faces the choice of pursuing experiment A vs experiment B, each of which will cost .75M to pursue.  One of these will lead to success and prove/provide the path to a great business.  The other will lead to failure and a complete loss of the .75M.  The SBE assesses that the probability of success for each path is .5.  Further, suppose there are no cheaper methods to get the information about A vs B’s likelihood of success.  The SBE has already done a large amount of customer research and that research has led to this point of the 50/50 coin toss and the need to run this final expensive experiment to confirm which path will work. In this admittedly simple/simplistic example, I believe there is an irreversibility of path dependence.  If our SBE takes the winning path, the firm will prosper without delay and without the need to raise further funds. Plus our SBE will not experience equity dilution risk with a need to raise more money, nor will SBE face the risk of new competitors entering during the delay, or having discouraged employees quitting the company, etc.  If SBE chooses the losing path, life will be much different, even if the firm can successfully raise more money and then pursue the winning path. Of course this is a simplistic example, but the principle is general, I believe.  In many situations, we are all subject to the previous paths we have chosen in life, despite the fact that we may be very fast learners.  Of course, if one can find cheap, quick experiments, the risk of ending up on an undesired path can be reduced, but the availability of such experiments is very situation dependent.

- bayes doesn’t lower not suggesting full irreversible, exchangeability is the only measure to gauge how reversible one’s actions are. action made after updating one’s belief (probability measure; filtration) exchangeable is more reversible compared to (q. finer filtration can make events more exchangeable as there are more to conditin on)three problem of current models: - lives in vacuum- there exist no stable format of desire- cannot model desire update with the goal of selecting“maximum growth/learning”environment, I suggest utility function epistemic uc/ aleatoric uc. i explain why action chosen under this utility function is reversible if at each step agents updates its probability measure so that additional observations are exchangeable to experimenting on both actions 
- eg testing disruption and architectural strategy given an idea is exchangeable as max(V1,V2) = max(V2,V1) decision: uncertainty class (H, L) and how many samples within one world?
- resource-constrained: argmax_(k,C) E[var(phat|k)]/ var(p) st k<=ko, p~{H,L}, phat_k ~ Binom(k,p)💰
- resource-relaxed:argmax_(k,C) E[var(phat|k*)]/ var(p) st p~{H,L}, phat_k ~ Binom(k,p)resource makes time exchangeable1. value of turning aleatoric to epistemic uncertainty is not captured (related to intention-based action)2. can be modeled by ability to construct deeper hierarchy ie quality if prior. 1/2 is ignorance prior or informative prior3. using in reverse - ——bookextendability to more tosses further constrains the exchangeableprobabilities, with them approximating the mixtures of independentones, just as sampling without replacement from a large urn approxi-mates sampling with replacement. loosen the assumption that the imputedchances make the trials independent to the assumption that thetrue chances make the trials Markov dependent.
