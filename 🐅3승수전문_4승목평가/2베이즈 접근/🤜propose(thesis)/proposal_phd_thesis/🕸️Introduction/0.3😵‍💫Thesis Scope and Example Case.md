# Three-Part Solution Framework

**Section 1: Bottleneck Breaking (Individual-level Internal Optimization)** _Problem:_ Entrepreneurs must sequence actions optimally under resource constraints but cannot estimate uncertainty reduction per cost directly. _Solution:_ At each time t, entrepreneurs minimize residual UC(a)/C(a) by selecting action a‚ààA, subject to constraint Da(Ae, Se)=S'e. This decomposes the complex metric into estimable components through bottleneck identification. _Mechanism:_ The entrepreneur iteratively selects actions that minimize uncertainty per unit cost, where the state transition follows deterministic dynamics in the short term. _Key Insight:_ Instead of exhaustively searching action sequences, entrepreneurs can make myopic decisions based on current bottlenecks.

**Section 2: Proactive Testing (Individual-level External Coordination)** _Problem:_ Multiple stakeholders (investor, customer, operational partner) create circular dependencies with interdependent decisions. _Solution:_ Entrepreneurs minimize residual WBS'e/C(A'e) for action set A'e, subject to D'e(S'e, A'e)=S'e^(t+1). This enables simultaneous multi-stakeholder engagement rather than sequential negotiation. _Mechanism:_ Actions are selected to maximize weighted uncertainty reduction across all stakeholders, recognizing that state transitions affect multiple parties simultaneously. _Key Insight:_ The entrepreneur acts as a central coordinator, choosing actions that create positive spillovers across the stakeholder network.

**Section 3: Expectation Propagation (System-level Calibration)** _Problem:_ Individual ventures and social planners have misaligned expectations about state transitions and outcomes. _Solution:_ A two-step calibration process:

1. Social planner proposes state transitions: s's = DÃÇs(as, ss)
2. Entrepreneur generates state transitions: DÃÉe ~ N(DÃÇe, œÉ¬≤)
3. Entrepreneur updates state: Da(ae, se) = s'e
4. Social planner updates expectations: E[s'e] = s's _Mechanism:_ The system enables bi-directional learning where entrepreneurs' actual transitions inform planners' models, while planners' aggregated knowledge provides better priors for entrepreneurs. _Key Insight:_ This creates a feedback loop that continuously improves both individual decision-making and system-wide resource allocation.

# Need: Improve Usability of Current Entrepreneurial Decision Models 

Current entrepreneurial decision models (EDMs) are not realistically tractable by entrepreneurs due to three fundamental problems, each operating at a different level or complexity:
## Individual Level Complexity

**Individual Level - Operational Complexity** Entrepreneurs struggle to sequence actions optimally under resource constraints. They must decide which bottlenecks to address first‚Äîshould they pursue testing facility collaboration or customer segmentation? Traditional approaches either rely on pure theory (lacking real-world applicability) or pure data-driven methods (lacking strategic structure). This complexity manifests in the challenge of estimating uncertainty reduction per unit cost, which we decompose into three parts: uncertainty per state (B), state transitions per action (D), and action cost (C). By breaking down this complex metric into estimable components, entrepreneurs can make systematic decisions about which actions yield the highest uncertainty reduction for their limited resources.

**Individual Level - Multi-stakeholder Complexity**  
Entrepreneurs face circular dependencies among stakeholders with interdependent decisions. Investors wait for customer validation, customers require operational approval, and operators need investment proof. The challenge lies in understanding how actions create spillover effects across stakeholders‚Äîfor instance, how validation from a testing facility builds customer trust. Traditional sequential negotiation approaches fail to break these feedback loops, leading to prolonged commitment cycles.

The key distinction is:

- Operational Complexity = How to sequence and prioritize actions given limited resources (internal optimization)
- Multi-stakeholder Complexity = How to manage interdependent stakeholder decisions and spillover effects (external coordination)

## Institution Level Complexity
At the broader ecosystem level, insufficient modeling education and poor coordination between ventures and public stakeholders create fragmented, non-cumulative learning. This results in system-wide planning failures.

# **Solution**

To address these interconnected problems, I propose three targeted solutions:

**Solution 1: Bottleneck Breaking (ü§úüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)** _Problem:_ Entrepreneurs struggle to sequence actions optimally under resource constraints (operational complexity). _Approach:_ We decompose the complex metric of uncertainty reduction per unit cost into three estimable components: uncertainty per state (B), state transitions per action (D), and action cost (C). This enables systematic prioritization of bottleneck-breaking actions. _Example:_ In our cement startup case, instead of directly estimating which action (collaboration vs. segmentation) yields better uncertainty reduction per cost, we:

- Estimate B: How much each stakeholder's uncertainty relates to current state
- Estimate D: Probability of state transitions for each action (80% for collaboration, 20% for segmentation)
- Estimate C: Resource costs (2 years vs. 3 months)
- Optimize using ‚àáw[U/c(a)] = ‚àáw[BS/c(a)] to find optimal action sequence

_Implementation:_ Sections 3.1-3.3 detail theory development, production methods, and evaluation framework.

**Solution 2: Proactive Testing (üßêüë•)** _Problem:_ Stakeholders create circular dependencies with interdependent decisions (multi-stakeholder complexity). _Approach:_ Instead of sequential negotiations, we use simultaneous hypothesis testing across stakeholders to trigger positive spillover effects. The dynamic transition model D(S,A)=S' captures how actions affect multiple stakeholders simultaneously, while matrix B helps anticipate accept/reject responses. _Example:_ Rather than separately approaching investors (who want customer validation) and customers (who want operational approval), we design experiments that demonstrate value to all stakeholders at once - such as a pilot project that simultaneously validates technical feasibility, customer demand, and financial viability. _Implementation:_ Sections 5.1-5.3 cover theory development, solution production, and evaluation methodology.

**Solution 3: Expectation Propagation (ü§úüë•)** _Problem:_ Institutional-level fragmentation prevents ecosystem-wide learning and coordination. _Approach:_ We develop mechanisms for calibrating expectations between individual ventures and institutional stakeholders, enabling shared learning and coordinated resource allocation across the ecosystem. _Example:_ Instead of each startup independently learning optimal paths, institutions aggregate uncertainty patterns across ventures to provide better priors for new entrants, while startups' experiences update institutional understanding of evolving market dynamics. _Implementation:_ Sections 7.1-7.3 present theoretical foundation, production approach, and evaluation framework.

Each solution addresses its corresponding complexity level - operational (internal optimization), multi-stakeholder (external coordination), and institutional (ecosystem alignment) - creating a comprehensive framework for usable entrepreneurial decision-making.

#### üß™ Illustrative Use Cases

1. **$C$ (Cost):** Should we run internal tests ($10K) or wait for official testing ($100K)? Matrix $C$ guides uncertainty-reduction per dollar tradeoffs.
    
2. **$D$ (Dynamics):** Does validating with a third-party testing lab improve customer and investor sentiment? $D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A})$ may show multi-stakeholder transitions from a single action.
    
3. **$B$ (State-to-Uncertainty):** Why is $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_i}$ still high after pilot demos? Because the investor‚Äôs perceived risk remains until formal validation (as encoded in $B$).
    
### üîç Examples Anchored in Sublime Systems

#### **1. Cost Matrix $C$ Example (Operational Constraint):**

> ‚ÄúShould we run internal lab tests or pay for external validation?‚Äù

- $\textcolor{red}{A}_1$ = Internal pilot ‚Üí $\textcolor{#8B0000}{R}_1$ = $10K
    
- $\textcolor{red}{A}_2$ = ASTM facility ‚Üí $\textcolor{#8B0000}{R}_2$ = $100K
    
- Use **$C$** to evaluate which action yields more uncertainty reduction per dollar spent.
    

#### **2. Transition Matrix $D$ Example (Stakeholder Dynamics):**

> ‚ÄúWhat happens to customer trust if we succeed with third-party testing?‚Äù

- $\textcolor{green}{S} = [0, 0, 0]$
    
- $\textcolor{red}{A} = \text{Collaborate}$ with lab
    
- $D(\textcolor{green}{S}, \textcolor{red}{A}) = \textcolor{green}{S'} = [0.5, 0.9, 0.3]$: High feasibility lift (ops partner says yes), modest investor and customer spillover.
    

#### **3. Uncertainty Mapping $B$ Example (State-to-Uncertainty):**

> ‚ÄúEven if we‚Äôve done internal testing, why is investor uncertainty still high?‚Äù

- $\textcolor{green}{S} = [1, 0, 0]$
    
- $B \cdot \textcolor{green}{S} = \textcolor{#3399FF}{U} = [0.5, 0.9, 0.8]$: Customer is cautiously optimistic, but lack of ops partner validation keeps $\textcolor{#3399FF}{U_s}$ high.

## SOL

## FULFILLMENT
from [[moshe_benAkiva]]
- you mentioned "1.Experimental (proactive)" is impractical or infeasible, but this is very usual in entrepreneurship where previous collected data hints the next experiment. I believe ultimate outcome of every model should be an action that triggers data based on which next action is chosen. Incidentally I don't trust any data collected by others (measurement issues) so my preference is experimental > hypothetical > observational
