which is  cost you'll  enhances our cost effectiveness and actually   be a 
valuated feature of the apps right the insurance company app
and example of compete would be to replace the existing government providing emergency response. Example of execution is based on 
they went around to some Silicon Valley venture capitals and they're like oh this is Uber for ambulances  some insurance companies came to them pretty much that 

to talk to domestic violence agencies non-profits the American Heart Association American epilepsy Association who  had  essentially a burning platform type customer and they were actually able to use this process to  actually say actually some of those options are really good down the line but aren't good for us right now or 

if we start working with insurance companies right now who are willing to put money on the table so we can keep the business afloat and not lose a lot of equity well that's actually going to divert us from really  solving this at scale for the entire industry and so they were able to use that process over time to really settle in this particular case they
