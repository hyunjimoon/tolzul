#ProgrammingLanguages

Why are we working so hard as to implementing a $[\![  ]\!]$ operator? Can't we just identify the meaning of a program by just looking at its code? Take for example the following code in Java and Python:
```
// Java
Integer x = 1;
Integer y = 2;
System.out.println(x.compareTo(y) == 1);
```

```
#Python
x = 1
y = 2
print(x > y)
```

Both programs possess the same meaning, that is printing out whether variable x is greater than variable y. But the program is *described* in different syntax. Notice the disparity between the programming language's syntax, but having the same semantic meaning. Do you feel why separating semantics from syntax can be useful? It allows us to evaluate the semantics of computer programs, *independent from how they are written*.

In this chapter, we will discuss how syntax is specified.

## Syntax
Recall in [[1. Inductive Definition]], how we defined the set of integer expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &\rightarrow n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \\
& \ \ | E + E \\
& \ \ | -E \\
& \ \ | E * E \\
& \ \ | (E)
\end{aligned}
$$

Let's augument this with a set of acceptable commands, making a mini-language of integer expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &\rightarrow \textbf{skip} \\
& \ \ | x := E \\
& \ \ | \text{if} \ E \ \text{then} \ C \ \text{else} \ C \\
& \ \ | C \ ; \ C \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We specified a set of rules denoting a valid (intexpr) program. We can think how each rule can be represented as a tree. For example, $E_1 + E_2$ will have two childs, each representing $E_1$ and $E_2$. The "+" node, which is their parent, can be used as a child of another rule, like $(E_1 + E_2) * E_3$. In tree form, this can be represented as:
```
    *
   / \
   +  E_3
  / \
 E_1 E_2 
```
Such rules, which define a tree structure, is called an *abstract syntax*. When we "write" a program, we will do so inductively, making the tree bigger and bigger as we add expressions. A programmer can use these rules to create their own "tree". 

But this isn't enough when we want to "read" a program that's written with abstract syntax. When we receive a program as an input, rarely do we input them in the form of a tree, but as a string. Therefore, we need another set of rules, that tell us how to recreate a tree from the string.

*Concrete syntax* is the rule used to parse a program, that is, translate a string to a tree. A set of concrete syntax rules has no ambiguities in figuring out how a tree should be constructed. Resolving `-1 + 2` with just the above abstract syntax rules can result in two different trees:
```
    -
    |
    +
   / \
   1 2
```
or
```
    +
   / \
   -  2
   |
   1
```
We can't decide which tree is correct, without another set of syntax rules:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E &\rightarrow n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \\
& \ \ | E + E \\
& \ \ | E * E \\
& \ \ | -F \\
F &\rightarrow n \\
& \ \ | (E)
\end{aligned}
$$

With this new rule, `-1 + 2` can only be parsed as `(-1) + 2` (the second tree).
