## Mission: affordable analytics for all
 
 - Reinforcement AI loop (user to user data to increased analytics of quality which pulls latent needs to induce greater number of users) cannot be initiated for small business people. Two reasons. First is the lack of infrastructure which prevents them from experiencing the benefits of analytics, second this ignorances which further makes them hesitant to invest in infrastructure. These problems needed a collaborative approach of business and small business people and further governments.
