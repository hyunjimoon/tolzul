Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complex prediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework of technical debt, we ﬁnd it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-speciﬁc risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, conﬁguration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.
