| Research Phase 🧭 | Core Question 🤔 | Theoretical Framework 🗺️ | Mathematical Formalization 📐 | Empirical Evidence 📊 | Key Findings 🎯 |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Problem Definition | How should entrepreneurs make decisions under uncertainty? | Scientific approach framework: Theory + Hypotheses + Testing + Evaluation | SI = (Theory + Hypotheses + Tests + Evaluation)/4 Range: 0-5 for each | Fig 1: Treatment effects on termination/pivoting showing higher termination rates | Scientific approach can be taught and leads to superior results |
| Decision Process | How do entrepreneurs choose between continuing, pivoting, or terminating? | • Methodic doubt theory • Efficient search theory | Decision Rules: • Commit if pi > p̄ • Pivot if pi < p̄ and p̂i+1 > p̄ • Terminate if pi < p̄ and p̂i+1 < p̄ | Fig 2: Marginal effects showing selective pivoting patterns | Treatment group shows more selective pivoting and earlier termination |
| Mechanism Analysis | What drives the effectiveness of scientific approach? | • Search efficiency • Methodic doubt | Mechanism Effects: • ↑p̄ → ↑termination (methodic doubt) • ↑search efficiency → ↑pi and p̂i+1 | Fig 3-4: Decision process framework showing choice patterns | Methodic doubt dominates over search efficiency |
| Implementation | How does scientific approach affect firm behavior? | Treatment effect pathways: • Direct effects • Behavioral changes | IV Analysis: y = β0 + β1(Scientific_Intensity) + ε Scientific_Intensity = α0 + α1(Treatment) + η | Fig 5: Efficient search probability patterns across stages | Treatment increases: • Scientific intensity by 0.319 • Revenue by €6,999 • Termination by 9.8pp |
| Performance Outcomes | What are the long-term effects? | • Learning mechanisms • Decision optimization | Revenue Model: Rev = β0 + β1(Treatment) + γX + ε Where X = control variables | Revenue growth trajectories comparing treatment vs control | Higher performance through: • Better resource allocation • More efficient pivoting • Earlier termination |
