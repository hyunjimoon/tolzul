simulation-based calibration can integrate.

- Integration of theory and practice through causal inference
- Pure inference without intervention misses opportunity for active learning

| **Practical Morality**     | üîçBrobdingnag                    | üèáHouyhnhnms                     |

- **Lilliput** represents a society consumed by petty disputes and rigid adherence to nonsensical rules, such as which end of an egg should be broken. Though technically primitive, their conflicts illustrate a focus on impractical ideals rather than ethical progress, placing them in the "Pure Rational Morality" and "Less Developed" quadrant.
- **Brobdingnag** embodies a society rooted in practical morality, emphasizing wisdom and simplicity over technological advancement. Their focus on examining human flaws in magnified detail reflects their pragmatic and morally grounded worldview, earning them a spot in the "Practical Morality" and "Less Developed" quadrant.
- **Laputa** showcases a technologically advanced society overly preoccupied with abstract science and speculative theories, often detached from practical human concerns like ethics. Their impractical intellectual pursuits place them in the "Pure Rational Morality" and "More Developed" quadrant.
- **Houyhnhnms** symbolize an ideal of moral and rational perfection, living by reason and ethics in harmony with nature. Their advanced moral philosophy aligns with "Practical Morality," while their societal structure and intellectual maturity suggest a "More Developed" classification.


----
- Lilliput: The conflict over egg-breaking symbolizes religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, particularly the absurdity of wars fought over minor doctrinal differences.

- Brobdingnag: The magnifying glass revealing skin imperfections symbolizes how closer examination of human nature exposes its flaws and imperfections.

- Laputa: The floating island's inhabitants represent Swift's satirical view of impractical intellectuals and scientists who are so absorbed in theoretical pursuits that they lose touch with practical reality.
  
- The Houyhnhnm-Yahoo relationship symbolizes the conflict between reason and passion, with logical horses representing humanity's aspirational rationality and bestial humanoids representing our baser instincts, while the stark division ultimately satirizes both pure reason taken to an extreme and humanity's capacity for self-deception about its own nature.
