- **First Light**: What is on your mind? What is your focus today?
	- i need facts to give advice to entrepreneurs. wish to do this as a researcher (goto person; this is the need for writing thesis)
	- i like serious people. met [[eze_ burts]] and would like to collaborate on removing obstacle (team, funding, scaling from prototype to product)for commercialization using quantum computing data (research + data collection + )
	- hi eric, you know i take your advice very seriously (e.g. don't learn the research methodologies too early before finding research topic that excites me, pleasing others is should not be the main goal of research, one needs luck (e.g. your user innovation meeting internet era)) on absorbing other's need. i acknowledge its importance, but to be very very honest, part of it comes from my chosen identity as a moonshooter. to wit, i attached the qualification exam paper i submitted and the feedback i received. i admit i lack formality and depth of understanding of one field, but i still believe this research is at the core of what scott and charlie cares: flexibility and commitment in entrepreneurship.

- **Last Light**: What were wins today? What's on tap for tomorrow?
