# what i agree
buy an option on information. Vagueness defers commitment until uncertainty resolves.
AV industry's double bind: high capital intensity forces early commitment, but fast clockspeed punishes those who can't pivot.


# what i disagree
- The Transformation: From Anxious Dreamer to Rational Designer
	- DREAMER to BELIEVER narrative is wrong as they are two different profiles
# what i question
Q1.: is confusing as the dreamer and the beliver are different profiles. e.g. waymo is beliver and tesla is dreamer. 
designer are those who manage strategic ambiguity wisely
Q2. be clear on whose option it is, founders vs investors. connect with ambiguity (sign) leads investors to interpret optimistically to their own agenda
Q3. be clearer on mechanism of “trap” (mid review)
- mech1:endogenous appropriability. believe they have pivoting option, but the fact that they chose the integrated system solution makes increases the strike price (??)
- mech2: attracts like-minded people. 

Q4. check what happend to comma.ai
