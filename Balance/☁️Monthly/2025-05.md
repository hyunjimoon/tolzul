# Established the mathematical foundation with the Newsvendor model

## Foundation: Mathematical Metaphor

**Core Contribution:** Introduced the Newsvendor model as a framework for entrepreneurial decision-making

**Key Concepts:**

* Underage costs (Cu) vs. Overage costs (Co)  
* Critical ratio: r = Cu/(Cu+Co)  
* Stakeholder sequencing problem

**Mechanism:** Translated abstract stakeholder prioritization into concrete optimization problem

## Context from Evolution

May established the mathematical foundation that would evolve through June and July:
- **May (peach)**: Newsvendor model foundation
- **June (blue)**: Added strategic complexity â†’ [[2025-06]]
- **July (green)**: Final synthesis with "Promise Vendor" â†’ [[2025-07]]

### Key Insights
ðŸ”„ **Progressive Refinement**: This month established the mathematical foundation that June would add strategic complexity to, and July would synthesize into the final "Promise Vendor" concept.
