# Synthesized everything with the "Promise Vendor" concept and matching value

## Synthesis: Final Model

**Core Contribution:** Named the "Promise Vendor" and introduced matching value (V)

**Key Concepts:**

* Closed-form solution: q* = ln[...]/Î¼  
* Value maximization framework  
* Ecosystem design implications

**Mechanism:** Completed mathematical model enabling strategic prescriptions

## Context from Evolution

July synthesized May and June into the final "Promise Vendor" framework:
- **May (peach)**: Newsvendor model foundation â†’ [[2025-05]]
- **June (blue)**: Added strategic complexity â†’ [[2025-06]]
- **July (green)**: Final synthesis with "Promise Vendor" (current)

### Evolution of Key Ideas: May â†’ June â†’ July â†’ Final Framework

#### ðŸ”„ Progressive Refinement
Each month built systematically on the previous, with May establishing the mathematical foundation, June adding strategic complexity, and July achieving the final synthesis with the "Promise Vendor" concept.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Convergent Evolution
The four themes (Problem, Model, Math, Synthesis) evolved in parallel but converged into a unified framework that addresses entrepreneurial overpromising as a rational response to asymmetric costs.
