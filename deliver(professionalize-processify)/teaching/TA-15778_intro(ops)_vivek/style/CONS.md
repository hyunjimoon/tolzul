# CONS Framework + Strategy Synthesis

The CONS framework analyzes how operations create value. When combined with entrepreneurial strategy ([[üóÑÔ∏èüß†scott]] stern's class) types, it reveals that different ventures need different evidence at the nail stage.

## Core Framework
```
Capability?                   Needs?
     ‚ï≤                          ‚ï±
      Deliverable? ‚Üî Sellable?
      ‚ï±                          ‚ï≤
Solutions?                    Offering?
```

## Key Insight: Evidence Standards Vary by Strategy

**Component Innovations (IP/Value Chain):**
- Serve EXISTING customers with COMPONENT innovations
- Must show immediate value and profitability
- Evidence: Revenue, contracts, profitable pilots

**System Innovations (Disruptor/Architectural):**
- Serve NEW customers with SYSTEM innovations  
- Must prove new behaviors/markets possible
- Evidence: Engagement, behavior change, network formation

## Evaluation Guidelines by Strategy Type

### For VALUE CHAIN/IP Ventures:
Ask: "Are they profitable serving existing customers TODAY?"
- ‚úì Clear performance improvement over status quo
- ‚úì Existing customers willing to pay
- ‚úì Unit economics positive from start
- ‚úó Vague promises of future optimization

### For DISRUPTOR/ARCHITECTURAL Ventures:
Ask: "Have they proven the new behavior/market exists?"
- ‚úì Users adopting new behavior (even at a loss)
- ‚úì Clear mechanism for future profitability
- ‚úì Network effects or scale economies evident
- ‚úó Assuming "build it and they will come"

### Red Flags Across All Strategies:
- Trying to be multiple strategy types at once
- No clear evidence for their chosen approach
- Can't articulate path from nail to scale
- Building features before validating core assumption
