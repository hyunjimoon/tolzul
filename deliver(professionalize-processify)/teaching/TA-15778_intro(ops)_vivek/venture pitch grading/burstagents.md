🚀 Dragons: BurstAgents
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONS EXTRACTION:
Capability?              Needs?
Multi-cloud routing      Location-bound AI creates
<30ms latency guarantee  costly delays and vendor
GPU cost optimization    lock-in for AI agents
       ╲                   ╱
        Deliverable? ↔ Sellable?
        Package AI anywhere  Half the cost vs
        Auto-route every 5s  traditional solutions
       ╱                   ╲
Solutions?               Offering?
API Gateway routing      "Run AI faster,
Multi-cloud packaging    cheaper, anywhere"

🚨 WEAKEST LINK: Bottom - Can they actually deliver 50% cost savings with <30ms latency?
🧪 BREAK TEST: Benchmark against existing solutions with real workloads
- Cost: 1 month, $5K cloud credits
- Decision rule: If <30% savings OR >30ms latency → adjust pricing/SLA, if both targets met → scale

EVIDENCE SHOWN:
✗ Weak: No performance benchmarks or customer validation shown

GRADE: 3/6
- Focus (2): Clear problem (AI infrastructure costs) and customers (AI companies)
- Evidence (0): Claims without proof points
- Experiment (1): Technical risk understood but not tested

ONE LINE: Compelling value prop but needs performance validation before scaling.
