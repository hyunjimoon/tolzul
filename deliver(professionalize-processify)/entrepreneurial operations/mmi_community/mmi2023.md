[[Flexibility and Coordination in Transportation.txt]]

# Comparison of Routing Formulation Approaches

Based on Professor Jacquillat's presentation on flexibility and coordination in on-demand transportation, I've created this comparison table of different routing formulation approaches:

| Feature                     | Arc-Based Formulation                                                                               | Route-Based Formulation                                                      | Subpath-Based Formulation                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**             | Optimizes decisions for connections between individual stops (e.g., "Do I pick up Alice then Bob?") | Optimizes over entire routes (complete sequences from origin to destination) | Optimizes over subpaths (segments between empty vehicle states) |
| **Variables**               | Individual arcs between stops                                                                       | Complete vehicle routes                                                      | Partial routes that begin and end with empty vehicles           |
| **Polyhedral Structure**    | Very weak                                                                                           | Much tighter                                                                 | Tight while maintaining manageability                           |
| **Number of Variables**     | Fewer variables                                                                                     | Exponential number of variables                                              | Moderate number of variables                                    |
| **Scalability**             | Poor for large instances                                                                            | Limited by exponential growth                                                | Good balance of tractability and performance                    |
| **Solution Method**         | Direct formulation                                                                                  | Branch and price algorithms                                                  | Time-space network optimization                                 |
| **Flexibility Integration** | Difficult to incorporate flexibility                                                                | Can incorporate flexibility but at high computational cost                   | Efficiently incorporates vehicle-customer coordination          |
| **Real-time Applicability** | Not suitable for real-time applications                                                             | Computationally intensive for real-time decisions                            | Capable of solving large instances in seconds                   |
