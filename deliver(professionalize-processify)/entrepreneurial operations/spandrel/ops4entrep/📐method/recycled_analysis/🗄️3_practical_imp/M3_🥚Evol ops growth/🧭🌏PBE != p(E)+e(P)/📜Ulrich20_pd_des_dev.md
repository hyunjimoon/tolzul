### üé≤ High-Risk Products

The product development process addresses various types of risk, including:
- **Technical risk** (Will the product function properly?),
- **Market risk** (Will customers respond positively to the developed product?), and
- **Budget and schedule risk** (Can the team complete the project on time and within budget?).

High-risk products involve substantial uncertainties related to technology or market, leading to significant technical or market risks. To mitigate these risks early, the generic product development process is adapted to address the largest risks in the initial stages. For example:
- **Market Uncertainty**: If customer acceptance is highly uncertain, concept testing with renderings or user-interface prototypes is conducted early to reduce market risk.
- **Technical Performance Uncertainty**: When there is high uncertainty about technical performance, building and testing working models of key features early in the process can help. Multiple solution paths may be explored simultaneously to increase the chances of a successful outcome.

Design reviews should regularly assess risk levels, ensuring that risks are systematically reduced rather than postponed.

### üèüÔ∏èComplex Systems

Large-scale products, like automobiles and airplanes, are complex systems composed of many interacting subsystems and components. When developing these complex systems, several system-level issues modify the generic product development process. Key aspects include:

- **Concept Development Phase**: This phase evaluates the architecture of the entire system, often considering multiple competing concepts for the overall system.
- **System-Level Design Phase**: During this phase, the system is broken down into subsystems and further into components, with dedicated teams assigned to develop each. Additional teams focus on the integration of components into subsystems and, ultimately, into the complete system.

Detail design of components occurs in parallel, with numerous development teams working independently. Systems engineering specialists manage the complex network of interactions among components and subsystems. The **testing and refinement phase** not only integrates components and subsystems but also includes extensive validation at all levels.

What Is an Opportunity?

In the context of product development, an opportunity is an idea for a new product. An opportunity is a product description in embryonic form, a newly sensed need, a newly discovered technology, or a rough match between a need and a possible solution. At the earliest stage of development, uncertainty clouds the future, so an opportunity can be thought of as a hypothesis about how value might be created. For a consumer-products company like Procter & Gamble, an opportunity might be a new type of cleaner suggested by a customer. For a materials company like 3M, it might be a new polymer with unusual properties. Some opportunities ultimately become new products while others never warrant substantial further development.

An opportunity for a new product is usually articulated with less than one page of information, often including a descriptive title, a narrative explaining the idea, and sometimes including a sketch of a possible product concept. Exhibit 3-2 shows the opportunity eventually pursued by FroliCat as it was first articulated following a brainstorming session by members of the team. The opportunity was for an interactive cat toy consisting of a swinging object hanging from the underside of a table, which would be moved around by a hand from above. This is an example of an opportunity that includes a possible solution concept, which is typical for efforts focused on identifying opportunities for new products in a well-defined category like cat toys.

Types of Opportunities

While there are many ways to categorize opportunities, two dimensions are particularly useful. They are (1) the extent to which the team is familiar with the solution likely to be employed, and (2) the extent to which the team is familiar with the need that the solution addresses. For technology -based products, these dimensions can also be thou g ht of as knowledge of the technology and knowledge of the market. These two dimensions are illustrated in Exhibit 3-3.

Because risk of failure increases as opportunities deviate from what the team already knows well, we can divide the opportunity landscape into categories based on the uncertainty ‚Äúhorizon‚Äù faced b y the team. Horizon1 opportunities are largely improvements, extensions, variants, and cost reductions of existingp roducts for existing markets. They are relatively low-risk opportunities. Horizon 2 opportunities push out into less-known territory in one or both of the dimensions of the market or the technology . Horizon 3 opportunities represent attempts to exploit opportunities that in some way are new to the world, embodying the highest level of uncertainty.

Because of the need to launch a product within about a y ear, the FroliCat team explicitly avoided Horizon 3 opportunities. The team wished to build on its initial success with the Bolt cat toy , and so focused on its existing customers and the existing needs it already addressed. It sought a next- generation solution for the existing need to entertain cats, and thus focused on Horizon 2 opportunities.
