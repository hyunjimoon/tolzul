On replication vs segmentation: My thinking was that replication is entering a new (probably geographic) market with a (virtually) identical process, e.g, McDonald's builds virtually identical restaurants in new (USA locations) with the exact same marketing, product offerings, processes, etc. Pure replication. Software products, (e.g., Microsoft office) require even simpler replication -- essentially license and download a copy (which is identical to what everyone else gets). For Microsoft, replication is virtually effortless, for McDonald's it takes significant work.

Segmentation, on the other hand, in my thinking, requires a new product variant for a new market. So, if McDonald's or Microsoft is offering a Korean version of their model to that local market, they have to do (perhaps far) more customization in product, marketing, and perhaps process, to achieve adoption in the new language, culture, etc.

Perhaps this discussion raises the issue that replication and segmentation might occur on some continuum, rather than be orthogonal dimensions.


NSS_GPS induces a startup to commercialize its idea by providing ten scaling tools. Tools are classified to atom_supply (A1_processify, A2_Automate), bit_supply (B1_Professionalize, B2_Collaborate, B3_Acculturate), customer_demand (C1_Segment, C2_Evaluate) and help startup update its marginal utility or belief or wealth. 

produce, distribute, sell, 
concept dev -> poc -> mvp -> scaling
poc (feas_tech)-(feas_ops-)> mvp
viability : baseline matters

five axis (d,v,f_o,f_t + TIME)  -> can we use perspective function d/t, v/t, f_o/t, f_t/t

mit: hand, brain, cag: computer, hand
collaboration of atom and bit (computer and human, mit and cag)
- computers can do the task with low cost than human
- human can test the quality of computer's task easily
- computer's work is usable quality, but not perfect

mit: computer, cag: human
- mit can do the task with lower cost than cag
- cag can test the quality of mit's task easily
- mit's work is usuable quality, but not perfect for cag

reduce three man to one man
- test quality 
	- resolve problem statement: cag should be allocated `feas_op`,  mit should be allocated `feas_tech`, 
	- constant updating 

mit: hand, brain, cag: computer, hand
collaboration of atom and bit (computer and human, mit and cag)
- computers can do the task with low cost than human
- human can test the quality of computer's task easily
- computer's work is usable quality, but not perfect
cag's request during collaboration : 1. fresh look, 2. do it in a time frame potentially feasible, 3. flexible

not too narrow need for not to scale

atom_supply(bit_supply(customer_demand)); analogy mapping of (need-sol)_1 to other (need-sol)_2

changi: desirability, feasibility (technology, operation), viability
- operational feasible and financially viable
- jet airplane, 
- sensor maintained in harsh 

to lower need uc, customer: more information to shrink uc (smaller and homogenous segment; N smaller) vs hedging (larger segment; N larger)
- cauchy distribution (digitization); 
- core user (sir, prey-predator)- discrete event and agent based modeling (different expectations); signal from user (user group1, user group2)


pair: optimization on conceptual space
fulfill: optimization on implement space

-> need(), sol() -> pair(need(), sol()) ->            -> fulfill(customer(need()), tech(sol()))
- segment is fulfill() stage

need is stronger for tesla / tech: ev architecture, 
ppl aren't actively looking for alternatives
- assembly 
fringe vs central customer (election dynamics, political opinion change - ventity)

greenant: sol() -> tech(sol()) ->

locked into sol we're devloped

u(x): utility of investors, customer, employee, //  growth, revenue, cost: need to be separated 
investor utility: is a function of growth, revenue,  free speech absolutism
employee utility: cost (except )
customer utility:
