through this problem and solution table, my goal is to 
1. introduce entrepreneurial decision making to probabilistic machine learning community 
2. Introduce Bayesian software to entrepreneurship community (scientist, educator, practitioner). 
3. engineer entrepreneurial mind with Bayesian software 
4. demonstrate it with Tesla case

[content] Entrepreneurial mindset 1.1 output : strategy, operations, tactics (upper one become objective of the lower) 1.2 input: observation, process of updating joint distribution of world model (üß†) simulation and optimization engine (‚öôÔ∏è) 1.3 mind component: heart ("confidence to say when change occurs that it‚Äôs not something to survive, but rather ‚Äúthis is what we were built for", DWM), head ("understanding that when change happens, it‚Äôs time to act and have a plan of what you‚Äôre going to do." simulate, optimize), hand ("converting the head‚Äôs knowledge into the capability to get things done." argmax, FWM, doing, brute force) 1.4 sequence of action: - clockspeed hierarchy üëÅÔ∏è:1..4, üß†:1..2, ü§ú: 1 (cost: üëÅÔ∏è $1, üß† $2, ü§ú $4) - üëÅÔ∏èobserving state (scoping relevant world models to form prior) - üëÅÔ∏è2üß†(DWM)_t inference on desirability - üëÅÔ∏è2üß†(FWM) _t inference on feasibility - üß†(FWM) _t üß†(DWM)2ü§ú - reward (translate world's reaction to agent's next action), value, utility, FWM, DWM), üß†2ü§ú planning (optimize via simulate then choose), üëÅÔ∏è2üß†2ü§ú2 inverse planning (optimize via infer (other agent (one's unknown)'s states) then simulate then choose) reverse Bayes: üëÅÔ∏è2{üß†(DWM)}, üëÅÔ∏è2{üß†(FWM)} expansion of entire set 1.5. axiom-based characterization

freedom (to choose FWM, DWM), constraint (extendable but finite FWM), uncertainty + noisy learning (uncertain not only on idea but how it's implemented (product and process) and since products share process, learning on previous product's affects next product with the same process -> hierarchical bayesian inference) meaning of supporting mindset enhance capability of hand (brute force; simulate all then choose, symbolic) characteristics of bayesian software that can do 2

2. due to the uncertainty from developing nature of state, optimal action sequence cannot be prescribed, but this formulation provides a structure where hierarchy of choices can be simulated in advance before commitment happens. 

in other words, our proposed software transform two inputs (theory on p(c,t,c,o,s) and entrepreneur's world model) to decision rule.

- out: decision rule

| Statistical Models üìä      | Use historical data to calculate the impact on air freight and delivery delays. For example, calculate the average delay in days (e.g., 5 days) for perishable goods and use this to predict stockout scenarios. Adjust inventory levels accordingly to buffer against expected delays.                      | AI can incorporate real-time data and news updates, refining predictions as new information becomes available. It can also simulate various scenarios quickly, providing dynamic adjustments to the model.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Manual Monitoring üë®‚Äçüíº    | Human experts monitor news and manually assess the impact on supply chain routes. They might estimate that 30% of air freight routes are disrupted and adjust plans to use alternative routes. For example, reroute 50% of perishable goods through sea freight, accepting a longer transit time of 10 days. | AI automates the monitoring process, quickly aggregating data from multiple sources and providing real-time updates. It can suggest optimal rerouting strategies and quantify the impact of disruptions more accurately.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Rule-Based Systems üìã      | Predefined rules trigger responses based on specific events. For instance, a rule might state that if air travel is disrupted for more than 3 days, 40% of goods should be rerouted via alternative transport modes. These rules are based on past events and fixed criteria.                                | AI can enhance these systems by updating rules dynamically based on real-time data and predictive analytics. It can also identify new patterns and suggest modifications to existing rules, improving the system‚Äôs adaptability and effectiveness.                                                                                                                                           |
| Addressing Difficulties üöß | Traditional methods face challenges in determining the linkage between specific events and supply chain impacts, especially when events are unprecedented. Experts must rely on their judgment and past experiences to estimate impacts, often leading to delays and less accurate decisions.                | AI can use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and correlations between events and supply chain disruptions. It can provide probabilistic assessments and simulate scenarios for unprecedented events, thereby aiding experts in making informed decisions. AI can also dynamically learn and update its models, improving accuracy over time. |
