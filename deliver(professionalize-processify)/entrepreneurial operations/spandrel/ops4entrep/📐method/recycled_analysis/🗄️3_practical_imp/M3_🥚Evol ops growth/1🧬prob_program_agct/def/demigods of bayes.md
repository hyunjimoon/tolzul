- **Thomas Bayes** - As the originator of Bayes' theorem, Thomas Bayes would undoubtedly be the primary deity in the Bayesian religion. His work laid the foundation for Bayesian probability and statistics.
    
- **Pierre-Simon Laplace** - Laplace expanded on Bayes' work and formalized the Bayesian interpretation of probability. His contributions to statistics and probability theory were monumental.
    
- **Harold Jeffreys** - Jeffreys made significant contributions to the Bayesian approach in scientific inference and was a strong advocate for Bayesian methods.
    
- **Bruno de Finetti** - De Finetti is known for his work on the subjective interpretation of probability, which is a core concept in Bayesian statistics.
    
- **Leonard Jimmie Savage** - Savage developed the foundations of modern Bayesian decision theory and wrote "The Foundations of Statistics," which has been influential in the field.
    
- **Dennis Lindley** - Lindley was a prominent Bayesian statistician who contributed extensively to the theory and application of Bayesian methods.
    
- **Irving John Good** - Good made numerous contributions to Bayesian statistics and was instrumental in the development of Bayesian methods during the 20th century.

| "under rapidly evolving uncertainty"                                             | "in a rapidly evolving information environment"                                                          | Original is better | "Uncertainty" more accurately captures the entrepreneurial context. "Information environment" is less precise and doesn't convey the same sense of unpredictability that entrepreneurs face.                                                          |
| "enables entrepreneurs to infer world states"                                    | "helps entrepreneurs to infer world states"                                                              | Original is better | "Enables" suggests a more powerful and transformative capability of the framework compared to "helps", which is softer. In an academic context, the stronger claim (if supportable) may be more impactful.                                            |
| "understand hierarchies within choices"                                          | "understand hierarchies within choice sets"                                                              | Revised is better  | "Choice sets" is a more precise term in decision theory, indicating a clearly defined group of alternatives. This adds academic rigor to the description.                                                                                             |
| "We demonstrate the framework's efficacy through a case study of Tesla Roadster" | "We illustrate the framework with a case study of Tesla Roadster's product and supply chain development" | Revised is better  | The revision is more specific and academically appropriate. It avoids the claim of demonstrating efficacy (which might be too strong without extensive evidence) and instead focuses on illustrating the framework with a specific, relevant example. |
| "illustrating how it could have mitigated potential disasters"                   | Removed                                                                                                  | Revised is better  | Removing this speculative claim makes the abstract more objective and academically rigorous. It avoids making unsubstantiated claims about the framework's potential impact.                                                                          |
| "smarter, speedier entrepreneurial decision-making"                              | "better-informed, speedier entrepreneurial decision-making"                                              | Revised is better  | "Better-informed" is more precise and academically appropriate than "smarter". It directly relates to the information-processing aspect of the framework, whereas "smarter" is more colloquial and less specific.                                     |
