Entrepreneurs make consequential decisions under extreme uncertainty, yet traditional startup advice lacks personalization and actionability. This research introduces STRAP (Sequential Threshold Reduction for Actionable Perceptions), a decision framework built on a powerful insight: reducing uncertainty directly increases your probability of successâ€”these are mathematically equivalent goals. This fundamental principle reshapes how founders should approach venture-building, transforming it into a systematic cycle of perception (understanding stakeholder uncertainties), action (running targeted experiments), and confirmation (aligning stakeholder expectations). STRAP provides a practical rule for choosing which experiments to run next: always target the "bottleneck" uncertainty that offers the highest information gain per dollar spent. This approach reveals that coordinating stakeholder expectations breaks deadlocks, using resources efficiently matters more than raising large amounts, and successful ventures naturally evolve from unpredictable to predictable outcomes. Case study on comparing Segway's STRAP-guided  (balanced uncertainty reduction across stakeholders) and its actual (over-investing in technology while neglecting market validation) operation, demonstrate that STRAP-guided ventures achieve better outcomes with fewer resources by systematically eliminating critical uncertainties in the optimal sequence.
