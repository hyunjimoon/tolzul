| Challenging AI Paradigms         | Shen's work challenges the traditional computer science paradigm by creating AI systems that infer what we want rather than being explicitly told |
| Technical Development            | Built planning compilers and policy programming infrastructure as tools to create AI systems that better understand human intentions              |
| Interdisciplinary Approach       | Deeply linked reverse engineering of human theory of mind with engineering more capable AI systems                                                |
| New Models of Human Intelligence | Challenged assumptions in computational cognitive science by creating models of fallible human rationality that are more accurate and realistic   |

courage of interdiscplinary 
- ai ssytem what we want () -> challengs cs
- planning compilers prob.prog (inference subgoals)
- ai faculties (understanidng minds of toher agent) - diverse (reverse engineering)
- helped pragramatic - cognistiv (fallable human rationality)

ambition and playfulness (ai system learn the rules of a game; can't tell the rules of the game)

construction
cooperative intelligence (infer andd understand others' goals)

collaborative robots (infer subtask), 

- reliably, safely, 
theory of mind as invesrse planning

sequential invers plan search (real time open-eneded bayesina goal inference) : prob.prog (prob.ai)+  model based planning 
cooperative communication + coooperative decision making ->  C:O{S}

⭐️refinement

🙋‍♀️connect boltzman rationality (inver rl) with percept odeule
🙋‍♀️ assign nonzero probability to action that is not optimal (implemnting!!!!)
goal inference = refinement

planning more tractable 
goal -> plan

🙋‍♀️first make second harder -> (by introducing planning)

hundreds of goals
## SIPS
partial pla for the goal (1/9) (total particle for each action)
🙋‍♀️downweighted when it didn't predict the observation
- initialize 
- resample wehn ESS is lower than N/2 - agents start backtracking (yellow gems are downweighed)

much faster than irl etc

# not only optimal but also robust
red gem 

allows for the 

(once you unlock the door, it should go to 0)


set of 
'
particle 
mangement, programmable particle filtering

pf)initialize, update, 

less particle = human like (approximate bayes inf p)

modeling utterances with LLM likelihoods
infer commands from ratinal language - infer goal

sumbolic, proabilistic, 

only action or only utterance we don't know the intention but combining we can
🙋‍♀️-> connecting this with resource use and uncertainty
