## Core Method: Three-Chain Value Analysis

### Components
1. **Capability Chain** (Green Triangle üê¢)
   - Supply ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí Launch
   - Focus: What can we deliver?

2. **Fulfillment Chain** (Red Triangle)
   - Supply ‚Üí Produce ‚Üí Distribute ‚Üí Sell
   - Focus: How do we deliver it?

3. **User Chain** (Purple Triangle üëæ)
   - Demand ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Develop
   - Focus: What do users value?

### Unifying Metric: $/time
- Producer utility: $/time generated
- User utility: $/time valued
- Balance point: Where marginal benefit = marginal cost

### Analysis Framework
```
For any venture:
1. Map all three chains
2. Identify $/time flows
3. Calculate deliverability = P(goal √ó capability)
4. Calculate sellability = P(user √ó offer)
5. Find balance point for operation success
```

### Key Innovations from Trinity
- **Eric von Hippel**: Users innovate by solving their own needs
- **Scott Stern**: Disruption vs architectural strategies for value
- **John Sterman**: System dynamics with commensurable units

### Mathematical Foundation
- Newsvendor model adapted for capability decisions
- McDonald's service time as $/time optimization
- Probabilistic framework for uncertainty

## Tools Ready for Deployment
1. Chain mapping templates
2. $/time calculation worksheets
3. Deliverability/sellability assessment
4. Exploit vs explore diagnostic

"The joker teaches us that three can be one when united by value flow"
