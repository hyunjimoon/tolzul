## 🔴 Specific Research Vision

My vision is to bridge [bayesian entrepreneurship](https://www.entrepreneurial-strategy.net/) (BE) with [probabilistic computing](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/) (PC). This presents a novel approach towards navigating the complexities of startup ventures through data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
