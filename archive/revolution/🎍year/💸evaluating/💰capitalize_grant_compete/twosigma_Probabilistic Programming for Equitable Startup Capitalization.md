Proposal by Angie Moon
In today's entrepreneurial landscape, there remains a critical gap in tools that democratize access to sophisticated financial decision-making. This research proposes a novel probabilistic programming framework for optimizing startup capitalization operations, focusing on early stage startup's capitalization vehicle like Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). Our goal is to create more equitable and interpretable systems for financial decision-making in entrepreneurship, empowering founders with probabilistic program-based tools that enable them to effectively communicate their value and potential to investors. This approach aims to level the playing field, particularly for underrepresented founders, by facilitating more informed and balanced negotiations that encourage investors to join in taking intelligent risks together.

Aligning with the MIT Probabilistic Computing Lab (PI: Vikash Mansinghka)'s perspective on intelligence, we diverge from large-scale neural modeling. Instead we interpret intelligence as decision making on world model, combining symbolic, probabilistic, and differentiable computation. This method enables AI systems to handle uncertainty and complex world models more effectively, leading to more accurate modeling of intricate financial terms, improved handling of rare events, and enhanced decision-making for entrepreneurs and investors.

We desire to develop Conversational inference of equity valuation and allocation in three levels.

To validate our approach, we can (1) gather cap table and SAFE (or termsheet) documents by partnering with entrepreneurship educators, accelerators, lawyers, investors in Boston (network including MIT [2.916](https://orbit.mit.edu/classes/money-for-startups-2.916), [15.431](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-431-entrepreneurial-finance-spring-2011/) class instructors (Shari Lossenberg, Matthew Rhodes-Kropf) and guest speakers from [Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com/), [Goodwin](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/locations/boston), [Gunderson](https://www.gunder.com/en/locations/boston), [WilmerHale](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/contact-us/boston),  [Harvard D3 institute](https://d3.harvard.edu/)) and Singapore (e.g. [SMART Innovation center](https://smart.mit.edu/innovation-centre/our-program), [500.co](https://500.co/), [Temasek](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index), [Softbank](https://visionfund.com/contact)) (2) test our query engine against expert predictions on 20+ historical cases involving complex terms like participating preferred shares and anti-dilution provisions; and (3) test our natural language interface with 20+ entrepreneurship students comparing their decision confidence and accuracy when using our tool versus traditional cap table calculators.

This work is not only technically innovative but also has the potential to address systemic inequities in startup financing by providing access to sophisticated financial modeling tools to entrepreneurs who are resource-constrained. Founders often fail capturing value from their idea and efforts as they didn't pay due attention in financing, especially guarding their equity.

Our approach offers significant advantages over existing baselines such as statistical regression models, Monte Carlo simulations, and in-context prompted language models. It can handle complex terms and dynamic scenarios with greater flexibility and consistency. While our initial focus is on the early stage, this research lays the groundwork for extending probabilistic programming approaches to capitalize scaling and mature stages of startup.

### 2. founder's vision and corporate culture
Perhaps in line with a corporate culture that  David Siegel supports MIT academia's Quest for intelligence (Vikash is leading member). In a recent launching/fundraising event, I enjoyed listening to [fireside chat between David Siegel and Dan Huttenlocher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z60xUDo-NI) (dean of the Schwarzman College of Computing) with transcript: [[24Fireside Chat with David Siegel and Dan Huttenlocher - Matter of Minds.txt]].

### mit designX
This research aligns with MITdesignX's mission of improving quality of life through creative innovation. By applying MITdesignX's human-centered design methodology, we address the latent needs of founders in equity design - particularly those who may lack access to sophisticated financial modeling tools. The interdisciplinary nature of MITdesignX, combining expertise from SA+P, computer science, and management, provides an ideal environment for developing and testing our solution. MITdesignX's venture accelerator framework could accelerate this research by:
- Access to Startup Ecosystem: Direct access to diverse founding teams (our potential customers) and institutional partners for product validation 
- Technical-to-Market Translation: Expert mentorship in transforming our probabilistic programming innovation into a practical tool for entrepreneurs
- Educational Impact & Scale: Support in developing educational materials and scalable deployment strategies to reach broader entrepreneurial communities

Through MITdesignX's structured approach to venture building, we aim to democratize startup financing by translating our probabilistic programming innovation into a conversational AI system that helps diverse founders make informed equity decisions, addressing a critical need in entrepreneurship while advancing the field of AI.
