## Recite: "From culture comes experiments"

### What belongs here:
- **Acculturate**: Building experimental mindsets, fermentation of ideas
- **Evaluate**: Testing hypotheses, measuring outcomes, validating approaches

### Key Questions:
- What culture enables this experiment?
- How do we know if it worked?
- What's the probability of success?

### Links to:
- **Theory**: How do we think about experimentation?
- **Empirics**: What experiments have we run?
- **Bayes folder**: Statistical thinking & validation methods

### Remember: This chain feeds into Chain 2 (🐅) for scaling what works!
