with [[ocean_jangda]] to reflect on [[session5 - frontiers of bayesian decision making]]

angie’s five takeaway: 
- persuading new game rule (conscientious contrarian) is more developed form of contrarian, 
- ⁠⁠interpreting human behavior as normative and positive (not normative vs positive) - need to follow scott’s comment on “payoff, normative”
- Palantir ceo alex karp hired first few hundred employees for culturalization
- sam altman (?) said to learn ⁠game theory, microeconomics, engineering for entrepreneurship
- ⁠ocean’s model of other people has higher precision - e.g. scott thinks as he speaks but his thinking brain is faster than his speaking brain so he answers his questions as he speaks and dive five level deeper / charlie thinks as much but only speaks what’s processed
