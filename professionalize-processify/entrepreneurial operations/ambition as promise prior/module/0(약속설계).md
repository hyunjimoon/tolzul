This paper develops a formal theory of entrepreneurial promise design, explaining why ventures with identical visions experience radically different outcomes. We model ventures as designing belief distributions over promise fulfillment, characterized by aspiration level and precision parameters. Through progressive model development, we uncover two fundamental paradoxes and their resolutions. **First paradox**: capital cheers capability but complexity constrains—resolved by adding deliverability prior to likelihood of selling promise. **Second paradox**: precise promises power and prison—resolved by paying for precision through verification rather than treating it as costless virtue. Comparative analysis reveals how initial architectural choices determine venture trajectories. Deliberately vague promises preserve adaptive capacity while progressive precision increases follow verified milestones. Conversely, excessive initial specificity creates fatal rigidity regardless of execution quality. The framework transforms entrepreneurial promises from communication devices to architectural choices that simultaneously determine resource mobilization and adaptive capacity. Our central insight: entrepreneurial success depends not only vision boldness or execution excellence, but also sophisticated uncertainty design that respects operational constraints while preserving learning ability.
