- **Key pattern discovered**: The evolution from promise-level (φ) to belief-structure (μ,τ) design reveals precision as universal constraint creating both operational failure and fraud through identical mathematical mechanisms
- **Implementation made**: Drafted unified management science paper bridging operations-strategy divide through four constraint architecture (physics, finance, flexibility, precision) that resonates with all committee perspectives
- **Next step identified**: Formalize Model 4's learning trap mathematics showing |μ(t+1)-μ(t)| > ε/(τ+1) requirement and extract (μ,τ) trajectories from Tesla/Nikola public communications

- **Key pattern discovered**: Academic writing style requires complete sentences with subordinate clauses that pack theoretical density while maintaining logical flow through careful use of em-dashes and colons
- **Implementation made**: Updated Marr's 3-level and Scale files to incorporate formal mathematical notation (μ, τ, φ) with rigorous definitions and explicit functional forms like d(φ) = (1-φ)ⁿ
- **Next step identified**: Develop fuller mathematical appendix showing derivations of optimal τ* = max(0, [(V_sd - V_snd)μ(1-μ)/c] - 1)
