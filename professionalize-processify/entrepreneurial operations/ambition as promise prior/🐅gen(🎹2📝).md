- **Key pattern discovered**: Academic writing style requires complete sentences with subordinate clauses that pack theoretical density while maintaining logical flow through careful use of em-dashes and colons
- **Implementation made**: Updated Marr's 3-level and Scale files to incorporate formal mathematical notation (μ, τ, φ) with rigorous definitions and explicit functional forms like d(φ) = (1-φ)ⁿ
- **Next step identified**: Develop fuller mathematical appendix showing derivations of optimal τ* = max(0, [(V_sd - V_snd)μ(1-μ)/c] - 1)
