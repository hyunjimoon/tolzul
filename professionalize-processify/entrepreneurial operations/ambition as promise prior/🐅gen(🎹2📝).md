- **Key pattern discovered**: Literature review must mirror methodological progression through constraints—from baseline (promises matter?) through finance (self-fulfilling power) to physics (operational bounds) to flexibility (learning requirements) to precision (information costs)
- **Implementation made**: Restructured literature into constraint-aligned sections (2.1-2.5) that build toward Beta(μ,τ) framework, emphasizing entrepreneurial priors as future-oriented social coordination devices that reverse temporal causality
- **Next step identified**: Draft methodology section showing how each model reveals constraints through mathematical progression: deterministic (M1) → linear (M2) → multiplicative (M3) → distributional (M4) → cost-optimized (M5)

[[2025-08-14|Progress Report #3 2025-08-14]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Literature streams converge on uncertainty architecture—from operations (existence before efficiency), decision science (belief-value co-evolution), to entrepreneurship theory (social priors as coordination devices)
- **Implementation made**: Created comprehensive literature table organizing 30+ citations by theoretical frameworks, showing how promise architecture unifies disparate streams through Beta(μτ, (1-μ)τ) formalization
- **Next step identified**: Develop empirical methodology section detailing how to extract (μ,τ) from natural language promises and validate against venture outcomes

[[2025-08-13|Progress Report #2 2025-08-13]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: The evolution from promise-level (φ) to belief-structure (μ,τ) design reveals precision as universal constraint creating both operational failure and fraud through identical mathematical mechanisms
- **Implementation made**: Drafted unified management science paper bridging operations-strategy divide through four constraint architecture (physics, finance, flexibility, precision) that resonates with all committee perspectives
- **Next step identified**: Formalize Model 4's learning trap mathematics showing |μ(t+1)-μ(t)| > ε/(τ+1) requirement and extract (μ,τ) trajectories from Tesla/Nikola public communications

[[2025-08-12|Progress Report #1 2025-08-12]]
- **Key pattern discovered**: Academic writing style requires complete sentences with subordinate clauses that pack theoretical density while maintaining logical flow through careful use of em-dashes and colons
- **Implementation made**: Updated Marr's 3-level and Scale files to incorporate formal mathematical notation (μ, τ, φ) with rigorous definitions and explicit functional forms like d(φ) = (1-φ)ⁿ
- **Next step identified**: Develop fuller mathematical appendix showing derivations of optimal τ* = max(0, [(V_sd - V_snd)μ(1-μ)/c] - 1)
