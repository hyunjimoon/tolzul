## 1. Three-Level BMC Expression

**Computation Level**
- **Goal**: Design optimal entrepreneurial belief architectures under four fundamental constraints (physics, finance, flexibility, precision)
- **Input**: Operational complexity (n), Value structure (V_sd, V_snd, V_ns), Information cost (c), Learning threshold (Îµ)
- **Output**: Optimal belief structure (Î¼*, Ï„*) where Î¼ âˆˆ [0,1] is ambition level and Ï„ âˆˆ [0,âˆž) is precision
- **Computation**: Joint optimization solving coupled constraints:
  - Physics: Ï†* = 1/(n+1) from d(Ï†) = (1-Ï†)^n
  - Finance: Weighted utility V_sdÂ·P(Sâˆ©D) - V_sndÂ·P(Sâˆ©Â¬D) - V_nsÂ·P(Â¬S)
  - Flexibility: |Î¼(t+1)-Î¼(t)| > Îµ/(Ï„+1) for learning
  - Precision: Ï„* = max(0, VÂ·n/[c(n+1)Â²] - 1)
- **Key Constraints**: Four interlocking forces shape feasible promise architectures
  - Physical law creates immutable operational bounds
  - Financial incentives drive promise escalation or restraint  
  - Learning requirements demand maintained flexibility
  - Information gathering imposes convex costs on precision

**Algorithmic Level**
- **Process**: Five-model progression revealing constraint interactions
  - M1: Null baseline where promises lack causal power
  - M2: Persuasion enables self-fulfilling dynamics (Finance)
  - M3: Operational complexity bounds promise levels (Physics)
  - M4: Distribution design enables adaptation (Flexibility)
  - M5: Precision becomes strategic choice variable (Precision)
- **Bayesian Update Mechanics**:
  - High Ï„ regime: Î¼(t+1) â‰ˆ Î¼(t), creating learning traps
  - Low Ï„ regime: Meaningful belief revision possible
  - Critical threshold: Ï„_crit = Î¼(1-Î¼)/Îµ - 1
- **Decision Architecture**: Entrepreneurs navigate constraint space by:
  - Accepting physical limitations (cannot change n)
  - Responding to financial structures (given V parameters)
  - Preserving learning capacity (maintaining flexibility)
  - Investing in precision strategically (choosing Ï„ optimally)

**Implementation Level**
- **Model Architecture**: Constraint-based optimization over Beta distribution hyperparameters
- **Computational Framework**: Probabilistic programming (Gen/WebPPL) for belief structure simulation
- **Interface**: Natural language promises â†’ (Î¼,Ï„) extraction â†’ outcome probability distributions
- **Key Innovation**: Precision as designed liability creating learning trapsâ€”mathematical mechanism explaining both operational failure and fraud
- **Empirical Validation**: Tesla (adaptive Ï„: 5â†’12â†’25â†’40 trajectory), Nikola (rigid Ï„â‰ˆ100 leading to fraud)
