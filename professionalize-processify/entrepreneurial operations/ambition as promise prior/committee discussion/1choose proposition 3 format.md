## Committee Discussion on Proposition 3 Formulation  
  
### Two Options Under Consideration:  
  
***Option A (Variance-Based)***: **Precision creates commitment through reduced variance**  
- "If τ exceeds τ̄ = 4μ(1-μ)/δ² - 1 where δ is minimum pivot distance, then σ = √[μ(1-μ)/(τ+1)] < δ/2, preventing meaningful pivots"  
- Focus: Ex-ante commitment mechanism  
  
***Option B (Update-Based)***: **Precision prevents learning through sluggish belief updates**  
- "If τ exceeds τ̄ = μ(1-μ)/ε - 2 where ε is minimum meaningful update, then |μ' - μ| < ε after market feedback"  
- Focus: Ex-post learning failure  
  
---  
  
***Charlie Fine (Operations)***: I strongly prefer Option A. In operations, we care about feasible action spaces. The variance formulation directly tells entrepreneurs "if your promises are this tight, you can't pivot your production targets." That's concrete - Tesla promising 195-205 miles versus 150-250 miles. The δ parameter maps directly to retooling costs and supplier contracts. Option B's "belief updating" feels too abstract for practitioners.  
  
***Scott Stern (Strategy)***: Hold on, Charlie. Option B captures the strategic essence better. Entrepreneurial strategy is fundamentally about learning and adaptation. The update formulation shows why BetterPlace failed - not because they couldn't change their promises, but because high precision meant market signals didn't update their beliefs fast enough. The ε parameter represents strategic responsiveness, which is what separates dynamic from static strategies.  
  
***Vikash Mashinghka (Practical)***: Both have merit, but Option B is more rigorous. It's grounded in Bayesian updating, which we can actually test empirically. With Option A, how do we measure δ? It's ad hoc. But with Option B, we can estimate belief updating from observed promise sequences. Plus, the update formula |μ' - μ| = μ(1-μ)/(τ+2) is elegant and directly shows how precision dampens learning. That's identification.

Moshe Ben-Akiva (Policy): I see a synthesis. Option A explains why entrepreneurs get stuck (commitment), while Option B explains how they stay stuck (no learning). For policy implications - like designing safe harbor provisions - we need both. High precision is problematic because it (A) commits entrepreneurs to narrow promises AND (B) prevents them from learning they're wrong. Why not combine them?  
  
Charlie: That's overcomplicating. Papers need one clear mechanism.  
  
Scott: Actually, I'm warming to Vikash's point. Option B is more general - it encompasses commitment (can't change) AND learning (don't know to change).  
  
Vikash: Agreed. And Option B's τ̄ = μ(1-μ)/ε - 2 has better comparative statics. It shows precision is most dangerous when μ ≈ 0.5 (maximum uncertainty), which is exactly when entrepreneurs most need flexibility.  
  
Moshe Ben-Akiva: So Option B with a footnote explaining the variance interpretation?  
  
Charlie: Fine, but we better have a concrete example showing how belief updating translates to real decisions. Maybe show how Nikola's τ = 56 meant even terrible market feedback barely moved their μ from 0.89 to 0.87, keeping them on a collision course with fraud.  
  
Scott: Consensus on Option B then? With Charlie's concrete example added?  
  
All: Agreed.  
  
Vikash: One technical note - we should probably derive the exact relationship between δ and ε to show they're dual representations of the same phenomenon. That would satisfy Charlie's operational concerns while maintaining theoretical elegance.
