# Summary Table: Environmental Performance of New Mobility

|Topic|Key Findings|
|---|---|
|**New Mobility Options**|The report examines personal and shared electric kick-scooters, bicycles, e-bikes, electric mopeds, and ridesourcing services that are rapidly being adopted in cities globally.|
|**Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**|The report develops a comprehensive LCA methodology that covers vehicles, fuels/energy, infrastructure, and operational services (including servicing, rebalancing, and deadheading).|
|**Primary Findings**|• Private bicycles and e-scooters use significantly less energy and emit much less GHG per person-km<br>• Shared micromobility emissions are comparable to metros and buses when vehicles have extended lifetimes<br>• Ridesourcing vehicles and taxis have the highest energy and GHG emission impacts per passenger kilometer|
|**Key Impact Factors**|• Propulsion technologies and energy sources<br>• Vehicle occupancy/ridership<br>• Infrastructure utilization frequency<br>• Operational practices (servicing, deadheading, etc.)<br>• Vehicle lifetime and durability|
|**Improvement Strategies**|• Increasing vehicle occupancy (especially for ridesourcing)<br>• Transitioning to efficient powertrains and clean energy<br>• Extending micromobility vehicle lifetimes<br>• Using smaller, lighter vehicles<br>• Reducing deadheading and servicing requirements<br>• Integrating new mobility with public transport|
|**Policy Recommendations**|• Leverage reporting requirements for evidence-based policy<br>• Focus clean mobility interventions on high-mileage ridesourcing vehicles<br>• Set incentives to increase occupancy of ridesourcing vehicles<br>• Standardize methodologies for evaluating micromobility emissions<br>• Strengthen synergies between public transport and shared micromobility|

The report concludes that for new mobility to deliver environmental benefits, it must be properly integrated with existing transport systems and subject to policies that ensure high occupancy rates, extended vehicle lifetimes, and transitions to cleaner energy sources.
