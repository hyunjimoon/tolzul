**Stream 1: Joint Optimization in Operations (40%)**

- Newsvendor extensions: Multiple decision variables
- Supply chain coordination: Tang (2006) joint pricing-inventory
- Service operations: Cachon & Harker (2002) scale/scope decisions
- Gap: "No model optimizes operational variables (q) and market parameters (β) simultaneously"

**Stream 2: Learning in Operational Settings (35%)**

- Bayesian newsvendor: Scarf (1959), Azoury (1985)
- Adaptive inventory: Huh et al. (2009) data-driven newsvendor
- Demand learning: Besbes & Muharremoglu (2013)
- Gap: "Assume single variable learning; we need joint (q,β) learning"

**Stream 3: Robust Operations (25%)**

- Distributionally robust: Delage & Ye (2010)
- Data-driven robust: Bertsimas et al. (2018)
- Gap: "Focus on uncertainty sets; we model uncertainty through heterogeneous priors"

**Positioning**: "Natural extension of joint optimization to settings where both operational choices and market parameters must be learned simultaneously"
