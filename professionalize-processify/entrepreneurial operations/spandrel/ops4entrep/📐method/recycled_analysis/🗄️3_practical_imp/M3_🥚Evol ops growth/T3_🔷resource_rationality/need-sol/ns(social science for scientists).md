| **1. Problem to intervene** |                                                 | Disease is treated only at the symptom level without addressing underlying causes.                         | Social science is non-cumulative.                                     |
| **2. Cause of 1**           |                                                 | Lack of understanding of the fundamental biological processes leading to disease.                          | High causal density and methodological incompatibility.               |

|                             | **2.2 Agent level use based on 2.1**            | Traditional approaches focus on symptom relief rather than root cause.                                     | Incommensurability (design choices); focus on not hypothesis testing. |
|                             | **2.3 Institution level use based on 2.1, 2.2** | Regulatory frameworks prioritize demonstrable efficacy over understanding complex biological interactions. | Existing methods ignore root causes.                                  |
| **3. Solution for 2**       |                                                 | Develop targeted therapies based on precise understanding of disease mechanisms.                           | Develop cumulative and integrative research methodologies.            |

|                             | **3.2 Solution for 2.2**                        | Adopt a precision medicine approach to develop treatments targeting specific molecular pathways.           | Promote hypothesis testing and evidence-based research.               |
|                             | **3.3 Solution for 2.3**                        | Implement adaptive clinical trial designs to allow for iterative learning about the disease.               | Implement integrative research methodologies.                         |

| **4. Theory of problem-solving action mechanism** |             | The theory focuses on adopting a precision medicine approach (3.2) to target specific molecular pathways and implementing adaptive clinical trials (3.3) for iterative learning, addressing the traditional focus on symptom relief and improving understanding of biological processes. | The theory emphasizes promoting hypothesis testing and evidence-based research (3.2) and integrating diverse methodologies (3.3) to overcome the challenges of high causal density and methodological incompatibility, aiming for a more cumulative and systematic approach. |
| **5. Implementing action mechanism based on 4**   |             | Implementation through precision medicine and adaptive trials leads to targeted, efficient treatments, directly addressing the fundamental biological processes of diseases.                                                                                                             | Implementing hypothesis-driven, evidence-based, and integrative research methodologies tackles the non-cumulative nature and methodological challenges of social science.                                                                                                    |
