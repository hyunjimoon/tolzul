While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, has few other nuances, and offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the **perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)**.

### [Quantifying the COVID-19 Endgame: Is a New Normal within Reach?](https://isdc.systemdynamics.org/paper/1751)

Eradication of COVID-19 is out of reach. People are eager to transition to a new normal where they can leave behind lock-downs and restrictions yet face a tolerable burden of disease and personal risk. Are we close to such new normal? The answer depends on both biological factors (e.g. the strength and duration of immunity acquired from prior infection and the transmissibility and virulence of new variants) and behavioral factors (e.g. how individuals and governments assess and respond to the risks, and how responsiveness to risk can be eroded by “pandemic fatigue”). Using a detailed model of the COVID-19 pandemic spanning 93 countries we project the likely course of COVID-19 as these biological and behavioral factors interact. We find that vaccines, prior infections, improved treatment, and the milder Omicron variant have already reduced infection fatality rates (IFR) by an order of magnitude compared to the first year of the pandemic. However, the increased transmissibility of Omicron, combined with the decay of immunity, leads to repeated episodes of reinfections and high infection rates, leading, in most nations, to reimposition of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The new normal may entail repeated waves, as seen in the first two years of the pandemic.
