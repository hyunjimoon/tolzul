# The Entrepreneurial Decision Styles Cube

## Core Concept

The cube represents a 3D mathematical framework for entrepreneurial decision-making styles. Each vertex represents a unique decision style formed by its position along three cognitive dimensions. The elegance of the framework lies in its ability to map cognitive approaches to mathematical optimization strategies.

## The Three Axes (Dimensions)

1. **üí≠ Theorizing Axis (N/S)**: Information Processing - How entrepreneurs mentally model possibilities
    
    - **N (iNtuition/Pattern Recognition)**: Small K value in U(env) function; relies on identifying underlying patterns with limited samples
    - **S (Simulation/Scenario-Based)**: Large K value in U(env) function; creates multiple detailed scenarios
2. **üìê Productizing Axis (T/F)**: Information Evaluation - How entrepreneurs assess information
    
    - **T (Thinking/Precise Analysis)**: Utilizes Œò_T evaluation function for objective, analytical assessment
    - **F (Feeling/Qualitative Assessment)**: Utilizes Œò_F evaluation function for subjective, values-based assessment
3. **üí∏ Evaluating Axis (J/P)**: Goal Adaptation - How entrepreneurs define success
    
    - **J (Judging/Fixed Metrics)**: Optimization toward predefined success parameters
    - **P (Perceiving/Emergent Value)**: Allowing success criteria to evolve through discovery

## Mathematical Representation

- Theorizing: U(env(state, act)) = argmax_k Œ£[k=1..K] P(state, act_k | Data, A)
- Productizing: Evaluate(info) = f(Œò_T/Œò_F)
- Evaluating: Goal Adaptation = argmax_œÄ E[‚àë_t=1^T r_t]

## The Eight Vertices (Styles)

1. **NTJ - The Architect** üèõÔ∏è
    
    - Pattern recognition (N) + Precise analysis (T) + Fixed metrics (J)
    - Strategic visionaries who optimize for efficient systems
    - Dilemma: Balancing analytical precision with the need for speed
2. **STJ - The Modeler** üìä
    
    - Scenario simulation (S) + Precise analysis (T) + Fixed metrics (J)
    - Analytical planners who minimize risk through thorough simulation
    - Dilemma: Comprehensive modeling versus timely execution
3. **NTP - The Opportunist** üéØ
    
    - Pattern recognition (N) + Precise analysis (T) + Emergent value (P)
    - Quick pattern-spotters who identify market gaps and pivot when needed
    - Dilemma: Capitalizing on patterns versus maintaining focus
4. **STP - The Experimenter** üß™
    
    - Scenario simulation (S) + Precise analysis (T) + Emergent value (P)
    - Data-driven testers who validate through rapid experiments
    - Dilemma: Rigorous testing versus learning pace
5. **NFJ - The Storyteller** üìö
    
    - Pattern recognition (N) + Qualitative assessment (F) + Fixed metrics (J)
    - Visionary communicators who build compelling narratives
    - Dilemma: Narrative coherence versus adaptability
6. **SFJ - The Creator** üé®
    
    - Scenario simulation (S) + Qualitative assessment (F) + Fixed metrics (J)
    - Principled designers who put users at the center
    - Dilemma: Principled design versus pragmatic iteration
7. **NFP - The Pioneer** üöÄ
    
    - Pattern recognition (N) + Qualitative assessment (F) + Emergent value (P)
    - Trend-spotting disruptors who lead market change
    - Dilemma: Visionary disruption versus practical execution
8. **SFP - The Explorer** üß≠
    
    - Scenario simulation (S) + Qualitative assessment (F) + Emergent value (P)
    - Iterative discoverers who build through feedback
    - Dilemma: Discovery openness versus structured progress

## Edge Relationships

The cube's edges connect styles that differ along exactly one dimension, allowing comparison of how single cognitive shifts affect decision approaches:

- Theorizing shifts: Changing from pattern recognition to scenario simulation (N‚ÜíS)
- Productizing shifts: Changing from analytical to qualitative assessment (T‚ÜíF)
- Evaluating shifts: Changing from fixed to emergent success metrics (J‚ÜíP)

## Venture Stage Application

Different styles excel at different stages of venture development:

- NTJ/STJ: Mature (SAIL IT) stage - strategic optimization
- NFP/SFP: Early (NAIL IT) stage - vision and discovery
- NTP/STP: Growth (SCALE IT) stage - adaptation and testing
- NFJ/SFJ: Growth (SCALE IT) stage - brand and culture development

This framework provides a cognitive map for entrepreneurs to understand their natural decision style, recognize its strengths and limitations, and adapt their approach to match different business challenges and venture stages.

## Implications and Applications

Understanding these connections between entrepreneurial decision styles and MBTI types provides several benefits:

1. **Leveraging Existing MBTI Knowledge**: Many people already know their MBTI type, making it easier to introduce them to their entrepreneurial decision style
    
2. **Team Composition**: Creating balanced founding teams with complementary styles to navigate different types of decisions and dilemmas
    
3. **Personal Development**: Identifying which entrepreneurial dilemmas will be most challenging based on one's natural style, and developing strategies to address them
    
4. **Venture Stage Planning**: Recognizing when a venture's needs may require bringing in leaders with different decision styles as the company evolves
    
5. **Investor-Founder Matching**: Helping investors and founders with compatible decision styles find each other, reducing friction in their working relationship
    

The entrepreneurial framework provides greater specificity for business contexts and mathematical rigor through its connection to optimization theory, while benefiting from the widespread familiarity of MBTI terminology.


2025-04-04

I'll create two explanations of the mathematical framework shown in the images - one intuitive version for a young niece and one rigorous version for a university optimization professor.

## üë∂Explanation for a Young Niece: How Entrepreneurs Make Decisions

Imagine you're playing a game where you need to make choices to win prizes. Sometimes you know exactly what prize you'll get, but other times it's a mystery!

### The Basic Idea (First Equation)

Think of entrepreneurs like special treasure hunters. They look at a map (the "state") and decide which path to take (the "action") to find the most treasure. The first equation is like saying: "Pick the path that will most likely lead to treasure!"

### Adding Information (Second Equation)

Now imagine you get some clues about where the treasure might be. Smart treasure hunters use these clues to make better guesses about which paths have treasure. This equation says: "Based on my clues, I think path A has a 70% chance of treasure and path B has a 30% chance, so I'll choose path A!"

### Being Careful with Information (Third Equation)

Sometimes you can't look at ALL the clues - there are too many! So you pick a few important clues (K clues) to help you decide. It's like saying: "I'll check these 5 spots on the map instead of trying to study the whole thing."

### Taking Time to Think (Fourth Equation)

The last part is about how much time you spend thinking before choosing a path. If you rush (small T), you might miss something. If you think too long (big T), someone else might find the treasure first! This part helps you decide how much thinking time is just right.

Just like different treasure hunters have different styles (some use lots of clues, some trust their instincts, some spend lots of time planning), entrepreneurs have different styles too! Some are like The Explorer (trying many paths), some are like The Architect (planning carefully), and some are like The Pioneer (following their gut feeling).

## üë©‚Äçüè´Rigorous Explanation for an Optimization Professor: Decision-Making Framework with Resource Constraints

This mathematical framework models entrepreneurial decision-making through the lens of bounded rationality and Bayesian optimization, incorporating three key resource constraints: information availability, precision of probability judgment, and computational budget.

### Rational Actor Model (Equation 1)

$a^* = \arg\max_{a \in \text{Action set}} \mathbb{E}[\text{Utility}(\text{environment}(\text{State}, a))]$

This establishes the classical normative model where the agent selects the action that maximizes expected utility across possible states. This formulation assumes complete information about the environment's response to actions and states, precise probabilistic reasoning, and unlimited computational resources.

### Posterior-Based Decision Making (Equation 2)

$\hat{a}^*(\text{Data}) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s \in \text{State set}} U(\text{environment}(s, a)) P(S=s|\text{Data})$

This introduces the first bounded rationality constraint: information availability. The agent now conditions action selection on available data, using posterior probability $P(S=s|\text{Data})$ to weight potential outcomes. This represents a standard Bayesian decision-making approach but still assumes perfect precision in probability judgment and unlimited computational resources.

### Sample-Based Decision Making (Equation 3)

$\hat{a}^*(\text{Data}, K) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{k=1..K} U(\text{environment}(s_k, a))$ where $s_k \sim P(S=s|\text{Data})$

This introduces the second bounded rationality constraint: precision of probability judgment, parameterized by $K$. Rather than working with the full posterior distribution, the agent draws $K$ samples from it. This corresponds to the üìê dimension in your framework, addressing how precisely entrepreneurs represent probabilistic beliefs. As $K$ approaches infinity, this converges to Equation 2, but limited $K$ reflects cognitive constraints on probability representation.

The sampling approach differentiates between:

- Small $K$: Pattern recognition/intuition (N-type entrepreneurs)
- Large $K$: Simulation/scenario planning (S-type entrepreneurs)

### Computational Budget-Constrained Decision Making (Equation 4)

$\hat{a}^*(\text{Data}, K, T) = \arg\max(T)_{a \in A} \sum_{k=1..K} U(\text{environment}(s_k, a))$ where $s_k \sim P(S=s|\text{Data})$

This introduces the third bounded rationality constraint: computational budget, parameterized by $T$. The $\arg\max(T)$ operation represents a time-bounded optimization process that may terminate before finding the global optimum. This corresponds to the üí∏ dimension (type 2 rationality or cost of theorizing) in your framework.

The parameter $T$ differentiates between:

- Small $T$: Perceiving entrepreneurs (P-type) who allow solutions to emerge over time
- Large $T$: Judging entrepreneurs (J-type) who invest resources to determine optimal solutions upfront

### Integration with Entrepreneurial Decision Styles

This framework elegantly maps to your eight entrepreneurial decision styles:

1. **The Architect (NTJ)**: Low $K$ (relies on pattern recognition), high $T$ (invests in optimization)
2. **The Modeler (STJ)**: High $K$ (relies on scenario simulation), high $T$ (invests in optimization)
3. **The Opportunist (NTP)**: Low $K$ (relies on pattern recognition), low $T$ (allows solutions to emerge)
4. **The Experimenter (STP)**: High $K$ (relies on scenario simulation), low $T$ (allows solutions to emerge)
5. **The Storyteller (NFJ)**: Low $K$ with qualitative utility (relies on pattern recognition), high $T$ (invests in optimization)
6. **The Creator (SFJ)**: High $K$ with qualitative utility (relies on scenario simulation), high $T$ (invests in optimization)
7. **The Pioneer (NFP)**: Low $K$ with qualitative utility (relies on pattern recognition), low $T$ (allows solutions to emerge)
8. **The Explorer (SFP)**: High $K$ with qualitative utility (relies on scenario simulation), low $T$ (allows solutions to emerge)

The framework's progression from Equations 1-4 illuminates how entrepreneurial decision-making in early stages occurs under increasing resource constraints, necessitating different approaches at different venture development stages.

### About the Four Facets:

1. üí≠**Device of Imaginary Results:** Do you reason using imagined experimental outcomes? yes / no
2. üìê**Precision of Probability Judgments:** Do you prefer precise numeric probabilities or more flexible inequalities? precise / qualitative
3. üí∏‚è∞**Cost of Theorizing:** How explicitly do you account for costs associated with theorizing in decision-making? explicit / implicit
4. üí∏**Quasiutilities:** Do you introduce utilities into your decision-making immediately or delay their introduction? immediate / delayed

**Key domain patterns:** Bayesian Statistics (aa--), Cognitive Science (ab-a), Entrepreneurship (bb-b)

## 2. Entrepreneurial Perspective on Sales vs Sourcing Problem

As an entrepreneur facing the sales vs. sourcing challenge described in your materials, I would focus on these three critical axes:

### Axis 1: Demand Uncertainty vs Predictability

**Why it matters:** This is perhaps the most critical factor in the entire decision framework. The study clearly shows that traditional wisdom (e.g., Fisher's framework) breaks down under certain conditions, particularly when demand uncertainty is high.

As an entrepreneur with limited resources, I need to honestly assess whether my product is truly "functional" (predictable demand) or "innovative" (unpredictable demand). This fundamentally changes my optimal strategy:

- With predictable demand, I can confidently optimize for cost efficiency
- With unpredictable demand, I need flexibility and might need counterintuitive approaches (like combining offshore sourcing with online sales)

**Decision implications:** If my product has high demand uncertainty, I should strongly consider online sales (üåê) regardless of my sourcing strategy, as it allows for inventory pooling and better demand management. The study specifically notes that high uncertainty can make üö¢+üåê surprisingly effective even for innovative products.

### Axis 2: Return Rates vs Keep Rates

**Why it matters:** The study identifies return rates as a critical factor that can completely reverse optimal strategy recommendations. This is especially important for entrepreneurs since returns management is resource-intensive.

Return rates directly impact:

- Cash flow (a critical concern for startups)
- Inventory management complexity
- Customer satisfaction and retention
- Overall profitability

**Decision implications:** High return rates strongly favor brick-and-mortar (üß±) regardless of product type, as the distributed inventory model better handles returns. If I'm in a high-return category (e.g., apparel), I should factor this heavily into my channel strategy, potentially even considering a üè≠+üß± approach for otherwise innovative products.

### Axis 3: Margin Structure vs Cost Structure

**Why it matters:** For entrepreneurs, margins determine survival. The study shows that margin considerations have different impacts depending on product type:

- For functional products, margin doesn't significantly affect strategic choices
- For innovative products, margin is decisive - low margins specifically favor online sales (üåê)

As an entrepreneur, I must be acutely aware of:

- My true unit economics (COGS, acquisition costs, retention costs)
- The impact of scale on these economics
- How my margin structure might evolve over time

**Decision implications:** If I have an innovative product with low margins, the üåê channel becomes particularly attractive regardless of my sourcing strategy. This allows me to benefit from inventory pooling and potentially reach wider markets without the overhead of physical locations.

---

The key insight I take away as an entrepreneur is that these three axes interact in complex ways. The study demonstrates that analyzing sourcing (upstream) and sales (downstream) decisions separately can lead to suboptimal strategies. Instead, I should:

1. Evaluate my position on each axis carefully
2. Consider how these factors interact in my specific business context
3. Be willing to adopt seemingly counterintuitive combinations when indicated
4. Regularly reassess as my business scales and market conditions change

This integrated approach to supply chain strategy may reveal opportunities that competitors following conventional wisdom might miss.
