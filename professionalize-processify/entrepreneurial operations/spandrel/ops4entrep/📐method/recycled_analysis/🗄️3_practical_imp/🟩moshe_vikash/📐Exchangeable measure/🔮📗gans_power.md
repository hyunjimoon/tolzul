⭐️The Blockbuster case is, of course, a dramatic example of both the failure to change in the face of a new technology and also how internal forces prevented that change before it was too late. But it is a prescient case precisely because the conflict between those that benefited from the new technology and those that did not was so stark. There was simply no role for retail outlets in the new world, but that was enough to prevent the business itself from adapting, even though its senior management understood what the new organi]ation had to entail.

| **4**              | **To Decide or Not to Decide** | Rules are “preemptive decisions” made to avoid real-time choice. AI lowers information costs, making it viable to move from rules to data-driven decisions. The chapter explains why organizations and individuals often “decide not to decide.”              | - _Obama, Zuckerberg, Jobs’ Clothing Routines_ (minimizing trivial daily decisions)- _Umbrella Example_ (weighing cost of carrying vs. risk of rain)                                                                                                                                                                                | - 🐬 **Clothing/umbrella:** _Value Chain_ (incremental improvement for existing routines—these examples illustrate how lowering information costs can refine small “component” decisions in day-to-day life rather than discovering entirely new markets or users)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **5**              | **Hidden Uncertainty**         | Many systems mask uncertainty behind elaborate “scaffolding” (e.g., lavish airports). AI uncovers these hidden costs, letting us re-engineer rules into better decisions.                                                                                     | - _Airports & Private Terminals_ (waiting areas as hidden cost of uncertainty)- _Hedgerows_ (risk management in farming)- _Greenhouses_ (pest control using AI scouting/predictions)                                                                                                                                                | - 🐬**Airports/hedgerows:** _Value Chain_ (they mainly optimize existing processes for existing “users” [travelers, farmers])<br><br>-🐘 **Greenhouse pest control:** _Architectural_ (introducing a more integrated, predictive system can transform the entire greenhouse operation—though it still serves existing growers, the AI reconfigures how they manage climate, pest risk, and crops)                                                                                 |
| **6**              | **Rules Are Glue**             | Standard operating procedures (SOPs), checklists, and rules keep organizations reliable. While AI-based decisions can improve outcomes, they require rethinking how tasks coordinate—turning glue-like rules into fluid decision-making.                      | - _Gawande’s Checklists & Boeing B-17_ (rules reduce errors in complex systems)- _Pandora’s Ad Personalization_ (from uniform ads to personalized thresholds)- _Personalized Education_ (individualized learning vs. uniform age-based curriculum)                                                                                  | - 🐬**Pandora ads:** _Value Chain_ (specialized component innovation—same user base, but more tailored delivery and monetization)<br><br>- 🐘**Personalized education:** _Architectural_ (shifting from age-based rules to AI-driven content reshapes the system—teacher roles, curriculum design, scheduling—thus “delivering value” to students in a more holistic new system)                                                                                                  |
| **7**              | **Glued versus Oiled Systems** | Introduces the concept of “oiled” systems that accommodate fast, AI-driven decisions. Contrasts these with “glued” systems bogged down by rigid rules. Uses Covid-19 rapid screening as an example of how to unstick old rules.                               | - _Covid-19 Rapid Workplace Testing_ (CDL Rapid Screening Consortium enabling real-time decisions on who can safely come to work)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | -🐘 **Covid-19 Screening:** _Architectural_ (re-engineering multiple organizational processes—HR, data privacy, sick pay, kiosk setup—so the entire system can fluidly incorporate frequent testing; it’s not just a tweak of one component but a redesign that delivers safe work environments for the same employees in a **new** operational framework)                                                                                                                        |
| **8**              | **The System Mindset**         | Merely replacing a human task with AI yields incremental gains. Transformative benefits require _system-level_ rethinking—redesigning feedback loops, incentives, and rules to fully exploit AI’s predictive power.                                           | - _Turing Test at Bletchley Park_ (task-vs.-machine focus)- _Healthcare System_ (complex rules & incentives hinder AI adoption)- _Cameroon’s “Cardiopad”_ (remote cardiograms show potential but need new system of diagnosis & treatment)                                                                                          | - 🐘**Healthcare/Cardiopad:** _Architectural_ (unlocking AI’s full value demands redesigned processes, regulations, and roles—i.e., building a new “system” of care delivery rather than plugging an AI tool into existing practices)<br><br>- **Turing Test:** Illustrates the _task-level_ mindset vs. what is needed—a full system approach                                                                                                                                    |
| **9**              | **The Greatest System of All** | AI may ultimately transform innovation itself. By accelerating or bypassing certain R&D steps (e.g., AlphaFold predicting protein structures), AI can restructure entire pipelines of discovery, changing the way industries invent and improve.              | - _AlphaFold_ (protein structure prediction)- _Amazon Recommender Engines_ (from simple A/B testing to AI-based personalized suggestions)- _Self-driving Chemistry Labs_ (automated experiments guided by AI)                                                                                                                       | - 🦠**AlphaFold:** _Intellectual_ (general “component” innovation—groundbreaking method that can apply across biotech)<br><br>-🐬**Amazon Recommenders:** _Value Chain_ (serving existing users with more specialized, data-driven personalization)<br><br>- 🐘**Self-driving chemistry labs:** _Architectural_ (full integration of AI-driven hypothesis generation, robotic testing, and reconfigured lab workflows can spawn new ways to “deliver” science)                    |
| **10**             | **Disruption and Power**       | System-level AI innovation destabilizes industries, reallocating economic power from incumbents to those who master the new architecture. Examples show how overlooked innovations can upend entire sectors (Blockbuster vs. Netflix, iPhone vs. Blackberry). | - _Electricity Sector Deregulation_ (predicting demand enabled decoupling & competition)- _German Tanks vs. British Army_ (WWII-era adoption of new technology & tactics)- _iPhone vs. BlackBerry_ (new architecture beats incumbents’ focus)- _Netflix vs. Blockbuster_ (streaming & mail-order model disrupt a retail-based firm) | - 🐬**Electricity deregulation:** _Value Chain_ (introduction of markets for existing electricity customers, but requiring advanced predictive tools to optimize supply/demand)<br><br>- 🐘**German Tanks & iPhone:** _Architectural_ (both involve entirely new system designs upending old structures)<br><br>- 🐅**Netflix:** _Disruptor_ (discovering new ways to serve new user habits—online/mail rentals, then streaming—where incumbents were stuck in store-based rules) |

### How to Read the **Strategy Relevance** Column

- **Intellectual (The Thinkers):** Innovations that are broad “component” breakthroughs (e.g., an AI method like AlphaFold) which can be licensed or applied widely.
- **Value Chain (The Partners):** Specialized optimizations for _existing_ customers and _existing_ market assumptions—typically making a known process more efficient or user-specific.
- **Disruptor (The Hustlers):** Specialized _system_ changes that _discover new markets or new user segments_, often competing directly with incumbents by inventing new usage patterns.
- **Architectural (The Builders):** Wide-ranging _system_ innovations that _deliver something new_ (or in a new way) to _either new or existing_ users, requiring the whole organizational structure or broader ecosystem to be reconfigured.

This two-column expansion (Chapter Examples + Strategy Relevance) shows not just _what_ each chapter’s illustrative stories are, but _how_ they map onto the four entrepreneurial strategies.
