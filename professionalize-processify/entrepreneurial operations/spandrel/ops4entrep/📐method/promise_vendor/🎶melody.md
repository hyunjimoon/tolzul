## Melody Lines by Section

### 🟣 Alert Melodies
- **🟣 Motif**: "Entrepreneurs' overpromising persists not despite rationality but because of it"
- **🟣⏰ Motif**: "Immediate unfunded death (Cu) versus delayed funded failure (Co) creates asymmetric costs"
- **🟣↕️ Motif**: "Variables explode from 2 to 8+ while constraints shrink—triple complexity expansion"
- **🟣⏰↕️ Motif**: "Overpromising becomes rational in data-lacking situations where discrete states meet amplified alignment value"

### ♻️ Dig Melodies
- **♻️ Motif**: "Promise vendor inverts newsvendor fundamentals—entrepreneurs optimize promise P for uncertain delivery D"
- **♻️⏰ Motif**: "Future informs present through backward causality—tomorrow's promise magnetizes today's funding"
- **♻️↕️ Motif**: "Variables transform from continuous known-unknowns to discrete unknown-unknowns"
- **♻️⏰↕️ Motif**: "Promise level exhibits endogenous influence where bolder promises shape their own fulfillment"

### 🟧 Grow Melodies
- **🟧 Motif**: "Expected value extends from cost minimization to value maximization where matching value V emerges"
- **🟧⏰ Motif**: "Funding probability rises with promise boldness while delivery probability falls—captured by scale parameter μ"
- **🟧⏰↕️ Motif**: "Closed-form solution emerges as q* = ln[(2Cu+V)/(2Co+V)]/μ"
- **🟧♻️ Motif**: "Value V modulates promise intensity contextually—amplifying boldness when Cu > Co"

### 🔴 Core Melodies
- **🔴 Motif**: "Entrepreneurial overpromising reflects rationality under asymmetric costs"
- **🔴⏰ Motif**: "Early ventures (high Cu/Co) should promise boldly; later ventures (high Co/Cu) should moderate"
- **🔴⏰↕️ Motif**: "Promises pull future resources into present capabilities through belief activation"
- **🔴♻️ Motif**: "Ecosystem designers wield value V as control mechanism"

## Full Symphony Arc 🎼
From recognizing the paradox of rational overpromising (🟣) through diagnosing where classical models fail (♻️), to developing the mathematical promise formula (🟧), and finally delivering actionable insights for entrepreneurs and ecosystem designers (🔴)—each movement builds toward the revelation that entrepreneurial over-promising is not madness, but math.
