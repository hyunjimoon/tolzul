- how explaining managing bit atom energy 🏳️‍🌈 affects my action

resource allocation to bit and atom across a startup's growth phase, I decomposed them into three questions and made a table for each:

1. how does startup allocate resource between bits and atoms conditional on the environment (industry/market)'s atomness? [BAE1. argmax_theta (y|theta, phi's atomness) #190](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/190)
2. how does startup sample and learn conditional on the environment? [BAE2. theta| phi #191](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/191)
3. how does startup choose to change its environment? [BAE3. update or updated phi #192](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/192)
