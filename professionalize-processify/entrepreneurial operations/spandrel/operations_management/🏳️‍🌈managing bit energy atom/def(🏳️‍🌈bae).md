## Double helix from clockspeed
- how to connect our manufacturing template's four adjustment times with clockspeed? lower sl adj time and higher inv adj time, less oscillation
	- supply: supply line, inventory, backlog
	- demand: perception 
![image](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/c314cee3-8004-41b5-858c-39ff2c66f0d4)
- from the figure, when does modules become commodities?, core rigidities?

- how is advanced manufacturing (use of innovative technology to improve products and/or processes, and may also include the use of new business/management methodologies) different from canonical manufacturing

## Dual pendulum : iterative diffusion of workflow 
spinoff of double helix with focus on workflow, by angie
- is the following reasonable?
1. x-axis: variability ratio of supply to demand (bio < chem < mech) valid?meaning in bio, demand is relatively known (cure disease, engineering cells) but supply is hard hence low var(demand)/var(supply). which is why pharma industry is slow clock speed. we know next to nothing about life engineering, but identified demand are high and certain.

2. y-axis: softness degree; bits only (1) vs bits+atoms vs bits+atoms+energy

@chasfine  how could we make your table below more richer with the three sources below?
  | DIGITAL | PHYSICAL
-- | -- | --
Development | software, apps, and/or online   services | Develop and set up products and   processes, including sourcing raw materials, developing supply chains, and   production lines.
Production | Upfront cost of development,   servers, and other digital infrastructure | Continuous management of   manufacturing & supply chains
Cost Structure/ Scalability | ~Zero marginal costs for more   copies; May require increased marketing reach | Unit production costs can be   significant and increasing scale may require added capital investment
Distribution | online via app stores, websites,   and/or cloud-based services | transportation to retailers or   directly to consumers; requires logistics, inventory management, returns,   etc.
Updates   and Improvements: | Can be continuous, remote, and as   visible or  invisible as desired   without the user even noticing. Allows for rapid iteration based on user   feedback and data analytics. | improvements or modifications   require creating a new version of the product and potentially   recalling/repairing the old one.
Data   Collection and Analytics | Data collection and analytics can   be engineering into the products and infrastructure to a significant degree | Unless the product has a   digital/connected component, data collection may be challenging, especially   when the product was not sold directly be the manufacturer.
End   of Life | discontinue support or updates,   shut down servers or online services. Data migration and user communication   are key considerations.  Some labor   redeployment. | discontinue production and factories,   and   dispose of unsold inventory. Environmental considerations, such as recycling   or disposal of the product, are also important.  Significant layoffs possible.

## 1. a quote from [inmates running asylum](https://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140)

> I believe that we really are in a new economy. What's more, I think that the dot-coms never even participated in it. Instead, the dot-coms were the last gasp of the old economy: the economy of manufacturing.
In the industrial age, before software, products were manufactured from solid material-from atoms. The money it took to mine, smelt, purchase, transport, heat, form, weld, paint, and transport dominated all other expenditures.
Accountants call these "variable costs" because that expense varies directly with each product built. "Fixed costs," as you might expect, don't vary directly and include things such as corporate administration and the initial cost of the factory.
The classic rules of business management are rooted in the manufacturing traditions of the industrial age. Unfortunately, they have yet to address the new realities of the information age, in which products are no longer made from atoms but are mostly software, made only from the arrangements of bits. And bits dont follow the same economic rules that atoms do.
Some fundamental truths hold for both the old and the new economies. The goal of all business is to make a sustainable profit, and there is only one legal way to do so: Sell some goods or services for more money than it costs you to make of acquire them. It follows that there are two ways to increase your profitability.
Either reduce your costs or increase your revenues. In the old economy, reducing your costs worked best. In the new economy, increasing your revenue works much, much better.  today‚Äôs most vital and expensive products are made largely or completely of software. They consume no raw materials. They have no manufacturing cost. They have no transportation cost.


## 2. analysis from a [textbook Erin Scott recommended on econ strategy]( https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Strategy-7th-David-Dranove-ebook/dp/B01AKSZ952 ):

1. Economics of density
2. Purchasing
3. Advertising
4. Research and development
5. Physical properties of production
6. Inventories
The first four rely entirely or in part on spreading of fixed costs. Physical properties of production and inventory-based economies do not.

> Physical Properties of Production
Economies of scale may arise because of the physical properties of processing units. An important example of this is the cube-square rule, well-known to engineers. 6 It states that as the volume of the vessel (e.g., a tank or a pipe) increases by a given proportion (e.g., it doubles), the surface area increases by less than this proportion (e.g., it less than doubles).
The cube-square rule is not related to spreading of fixed costs. So what does the cube-square rule have to do with economies of scale? In many production processes, production capacity is proportional to the volume of the production vessel, whereas the total cost of producing at capacity is proportional to the surface area of the vessel. This implies that as capacity increases, the average cost of producing at capacity decreases because the ratio of surface area to volume decreases. More generally, the physical properties of production often allow firms to expand capacity without comparable increases in costs.
Oil pipelines are an excellent example of this phenomenon. The cost of transporting oil is an increasing function of the friction between the oil and the pipe. Because the friction increases as the pipe‚Äôs surface area increases, transportation costs are proportional to the pipe‚Äôs surface area. By contrast, the amount of oil that can be pumped through the pipe depends on its volume. Thus, the average cost of a pipeline declines as desired throughput increases. Other processes that exhibit scale economies owing to the cube-square rule or related properties include warehousing (the cost of making the warehouse is largely determined by its surface area) and brewing beer (the volume of the brewing tanks determines output).

I found attached paper from 15.357 reading list interesting as it explains hardware makes entrepreneur financially constrained (capital up-front), increasing the grant effect for hardware firms  (Table 7, column 3). However, there is no comparable effect on survival.
Also, "Emerging versus mature sector" is interesting as in [this](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/30194633/262426992-410000a2-1bfd-438c-8027-c505f88fa14d.png?jwt=*** diagram from #159, two axis of industry (env) were clockspeed and trend of industry.

how would the following change for hardware?
1. diagram (operation)
q1. does longer planning delay require less energy? depends on whether it's infinite order delay or smoothing (3rd degree) delay. if latter, the longer, the more energy as it need to keep track of past data.
q2. if q1 is yes, can we the problem as allocating resource to three tasks (release, planning, reengineering) across 100 weeks? e.g. release cycle is 4, planning delay is 2, reengineering delay is 1 (week) then the firm allocates its energy to each task as 1/7:2/7:4/7.

3. interpretation
2.1 release cycle lengths
2.2 planning delay
2.3 reengineering capacity

To answer resource allocation to bit and atom across a startup's growth phase, I decomposed them into three questions and made a table for each:
1. how does startup allocate resource between bits and atoms conditional on the environment (industry/market)'s atomness? #190 
2. how does startup sample and learn conditional on the environment? #191 
3. how does startup choose to change its environment? #192 

<img width="1056" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/assets/30194633/4795e4bb-ba08-4cc5-9d1a-3819cf74b875">

## table1: bit and atom
Building on [Table1](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/190#discussion-6254456), I wish to understand resource allocation between startup's subcomponents **given the environment**. My hypothesis is industry's atomness affect startup operation greatly. Extending https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/147#discussioncomment-7022032 which compared how atom (physical) and bit ( digital) character affects startup operations in across lifecycle (development to end of life + entry barrier) I used analogical structure of DIGITAL:PHYSICAL = BIOTECH:SEMICONDUCTOR to flesh out the comparison. Moreover, framing these with biological analogies (cell, ecosystem, evolution, phylogeny, life) helped me understand startup biology and evolution. Dynamic feature in evolution helps us understand/formulate successful startup pivot by benchmarking across industry described in #100.

## table2: learn and grow
Building on [Table2](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/191#discussioncomment-8558622), I wish to understand how agent learn from environment and grow.

## table3: pivot
This investigates how a startup choose to **change its environment**. My hypothesis is, we can list conditions of successful pivot by combining Table1 and Table2. Moreover, we can answer, How is planned pivot (strategic) and improvised pivot differ? Where does Moderna's pivot which shifted from mRNA technology for therapy to vaccine development upon Covid lie on this spectrum? Could we understand successful and failed pivots in unified framework? 

Building on expative innovation discussed in https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/184#discussioncomment-8494869, we may need counterfactual (pivot vs non-pivot) which may be approached by modularized timeseries with e.g.  gaussian process (as in Birthday problem [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avehtari/casestudies/blob/master/Birthdays/birthdays.html) which can be represented as model network in sec.9.3 of [Multi-Model Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06329.pdf)). Using the analogy of sampling algorithm and startup learning during its growth, I built table2 which tries to use sampling algorithm's learning phase to give quantifiable (at least ordinal enough to turn causal loop into tree that identifies bottleneck) to current nail, scale, sail framework by Charlie.
