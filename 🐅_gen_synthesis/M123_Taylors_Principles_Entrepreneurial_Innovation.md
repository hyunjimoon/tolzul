| üìê**1. Develop scientific methods by applying measurement and statistics to existing work practices** | **Quality measure for mobility innovation ecosystem**                                                 | This solution module directly aligns with Taylor‚Äôs first principle by applying systematic measurement and statistical analysis to assess and quantify the quality of innovation within mobility ecosystems. It provides a technical foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of existing practices and identifying areas for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| üêì**2. Select workers suited for tasks, then train them to become top performers**                    | **Simulation-based experimentation for Bayesian entrepreneurship**                                    | This module operationalizes Taylor‚Äôs second principle through simulation-based experimentation, systematically selecting and refining entrepreneurial methods (workers suited for entrepreneurial tasks) that best fit the Bayesian entrepreneurial context. Specifically, this involves training decision-makers (e.g., novices and experts identified by evaluators like Moshe, Charlie, Scott) through structured simulations, thereby optimizing their performance in entrepreneurial decision-making tasks.                                                                                                                  |
| ü•ö**3. Management and workers collaborate to implement scientific work methods developed in 1, 2**    | **Entrepreneurial operations using rational meaning construction implemented with program synthesis** | This module embodies the collaboration outlined in Taylor‚Äôs third principle by integrating managerial and operational perspectives through program synthesis. Stakeholders (entrepreneurs and workers) collaborate in implementing scientifically validated methods from modules 1 and 2, enabling coherent, rational decision-making. This aligns technical feasibility and operational practicality with the higher-level goal of desirability through jointly constructed meaning. Evaluators like Vikash and Charlie particularly value collaborative approaches for enhancing organizational and entrepreneurial operations. |

This mapping ensures that your solution modules are systematically grounded in a rigorous methodological tradition (Taylor‚Äôs principles), aligning technical, operational, and collaborative elements to justify their structured and parallel development.
