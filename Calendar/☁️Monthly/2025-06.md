# Added strategic complexity with two binary framings

## Dynamics: Strategic Complexity

**Core Contribution:** Framed the "technology push vs. customer pull" dilemma

**Key Concepts:**

* Differing "clockspeeds" (Î¼ parameter)  
* Problem â†’ Needs â†’ Model framework  
* Temporal and spatial dimensions

**Mechanism:** Added dynamism through clockspeed concept and structured narrative flow

### Two Binary Framings:
1. **Act then learn vs. Learn then act** - emphasis on flexibility (bidirectional)
2. **Push vs. Pull** - technology push vs. customer pull dynamics

## Context from Evolution

June built strategic complexity on May's foundation:
- **May (peach)**: Newsvendor model foundation â†’ [[2025-05]]
- **June (blue)**: Added strategic complexity (current)
- **July (green)**: Final synthesis with "Promise Vendor" â†’ [[2025-07]]

### Key Insights
ðŸ”„ **Progressive Refinement**: This month added strategic complexity to May's mathematical foundation through the clockspeed concept and structured narrative flow, setting the stage for July's synthesis.
