âš¡TOLTOL: Rename Jokerâ†’three chains, fix phi notation, clarify GaNS baseline
ðŸ§²ZULZUL: Build model progression 1â†’2â†’3â†’4â†’5 showing entrepreneur's promise evolution

â†’ $/time test:
  Deliver? Clear progression Ã— Bayesian framework = âœ“
  Sell? OM professors Ã— Promise-precision tradeoff = âœ“

**Learning**: External clarity (naming, notation) enables internal rigor (model logic)

## TODO from Charlie Meeting:
1. **Immediate fixes** (âš¡toltol):
   - [ ] Change "Joker diagram" â†’ "three chains diagram"
   - [ ] Fix notation: phi (not five) throughout
   - [ ] Remove beta distribution from abstract

2. **Deep work** (ðŸ§²zulzul):
   - [ ] Map GaNS model clearly as baseline (model 1)
   - [ ] Articulate why each model progression matters
   - [ ] Solve for optimal Î¼* in model 3
   - [ ] Add convex d(Ï†) analysis for model 3b

3. **Paper structure**:
   - [ ] Crystal-clear introduction BEFORE literature review
   - [ ] Each model shows: entrepreneur chooses â†’ affects outcomes
   - [ ] Model 1: No choice (p,V exogenous)
   - [ ] Model 2: Choose Ï† (cheap talk)
   - [ ] Model 3: Trade-off sell vs deliver
   - [ ] Model 4: Choose Î¼,Ï„ (precision matters)
   - [ ] Model 5: Precision has cost cÂ·ln(Ï„)
