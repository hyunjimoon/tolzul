## Course: Operations for Entrepreneurs (The Joker Way)

### Module Structure (Following Vivek's Framework)

**Module 1: Capacity Analytics**
- But through entrepreneurial lens
- Case: How BK disrupted McDonald's capacity model
- Tool: Predictable variability assessment
- Joker moment: "Your capacity IS your capability"

**Module 2: Inventory/SC Management**
- Reimagined for high variability contexts
- Case: Zara's responsive supply chain
- Tool: Three-chain mapping exercise
- Joker moment: "Inventory is frozen user value"

**Module 3: Demand Management**
- Revenue management meets user innovation
- Case: Blue Apron's user-driven operations
- Tool: $/time value calculator
- Joker moment: "Users create themselves"

### Teaching Philosophy
The joker teaches us that operations can be:
- **Playful** yet rigorous
- **Entrepreneurial** yet systematic
- **User-centric** yet capability-aware

### Key Pedagogical Innovations

1. **Visual Language**: Always use the triangle framework
   - Students draw their venture as three triangles
   - $/time flows as blue waves beneath

2. **Case Selection**: Mix exploit and explore examples
   - Show when to be McDonald's (exploit)
   - Show when to be Zara (explore)

3. **Assignments**: 
   - Map your venture's three chains
   - Calculate your $/time metrics
   - Diagnose your variability context
   - Design your balance strategy

### Course Deliverables
1. Joker framework toolkit
2. Industry-specific templates
3. Guest entrepreneurs who embody the framework
4. Final project: "Operationalize Your Venture"

### Success Metrics
- Students can diagnose exploit vs explore contexts
- Students calculate $/time for their ventures
- Students balance deliverability and sellability
- Students see operations as enabler, not constraint

"In this course, we put on the joker's mask and see operations anew"
