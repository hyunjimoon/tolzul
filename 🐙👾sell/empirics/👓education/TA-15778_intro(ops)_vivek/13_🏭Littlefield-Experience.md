## Graded Simulation Report Questions

Students must submit a 4-page report (excluding appendices) addressing:

### Question 1: Demand Forecasting
**Prompt:** How did you forecast demand? For what decisions in the game did you find it most useful to have a demand forecast available? Ex-post, were you happy with your demand forecasting technique and would you use the same one if the game was to start over again?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Forecasting Methods:** Moving averages, exponential smoothing, trend analysis
- **Decision Applications:** Capacity planning, inventory setting, contract selection
- **Performance Evaluation:** Accuracy assessment and lessons learned
- **Improvement Opportunities:** What would you do differently?

### Question 2: Capacity Decision Process
**Prompt:** What models and/or considerations did you use to decide how many machines of each type to buy initially? Later on during the simulation, how did you decide how many more machines to buy or sell? Ex-post, were you happy with your capacity decision process and would you use the same one if the game was to start over again?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Initial Decisions:** Pre-simulation capacity planning
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Response to demand changes and bottlenecks
- **Decision Models:** Quantitative vs. intuitive approaches
- **Performance Assessment:** Effectiveness of capacity management

### Question 3: Inventory Replenishment Policy
**Prompt:** How did you decide on the parameters of your (R,Q) inventory replenishment policy? How did you update these parameters over time? Ex-post, were you happy with your inventory model and would you use the same one if the game was to start over again?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Parameter Setting:** Initial R (reorder point) and Q (order quantity) decisions
- **Dynamic Updates:** How parameters changed during simulation
- **Model Selection:** EOQ, newsvendor, or other approaches
- **Performance Review:** Inventory costs vs. service levels achieved

### Question 4: Contract Type Selection
**Prompt:** How did you decide initially and later in the game what type of contract to go after? Ex-post, were you happy with your method/model for quoting lead-times and would you use the same one if the game was to start over again?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Initial Strategy:** Early contract type selection logic
- **Dynamic Strategy:** Adaptation to changing conditions
- **Lead-Time Modeling:** How you estimated delivery capabilities
- **Revenue Optimization:** Balance between price and delivery risk

### Question 5: Factory Performance Analysis
**Prompt:** Describe your factory's performance during the simulation, both in absolute and relative terms, and provide an interpretation. Is there anything not already mentioned in any of your previous answers which you would do in order to improve your performance if you were to play the game a second time?

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Absolute Performance:** Revenue, costs, utilization, service levels
- **Relative Performance:** Ranking vs. other teams
