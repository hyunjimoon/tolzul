Speaker 1  0:23  
Hey, all right, Morning, everyone Morning, quick

Unknown Speaker  0:32  
second here do

Speaker 1  0:40  
you. Okay, so what I'd like to do today is sort of the following. So first, I kind of want to pick back up where we I want to pick back up where we left off. Okay, first talking about Zara, and I want to kind of really kind of collect our thoughts there at some level, you know, between kind of working on, kind of what's due tomorrow, you know, and kind of having a day or two to think about it. And hopefully some of this news vendor business has kind of sunk in a little bit. And yeah, I think it's good, good good opportunity to kind of just reflect on what we saw at Zara. Okay, and so when we left off on Tuesday, right, what I said was, listen like, if we sort of think about Zara supply chain, basically, because it's vertically integrated, and they can expect, essentially respond fairly quickly, right? They're kind of producing clothes effectively during the season, right, as opposed to way far back. Now, it's not in the middle of the season, right, like there's still kind of some lead time and so on and so forth required, but it's much closer to a time of consumption than doing a kind of year in advance. And so we said, well, listen, as a result of doing that, we sort of think about demand uncertainty as opposed to demand uncertainty being wide, it's much narrower, right? There is uncertainty, but it's much, much narrower than it would be otherwise, right? And so we said, Listen, you know, we sort of thought about demand uncertainty as opposed to being less wide, like this. Perhaps it's like much narrower, things are much more certain. And, you know, translating that into news vendor speak, right? Effectively, we're saying, you know, the standard deviation in kind of demand from the perspective of, you know, 15 weeks in advance, you know, that that's effectively lower. The second thing we talked about was, kind of their margins, right? And I said, despite kind of being vertically integrated and all this stuff, you know, they're not dumbs, and they've kind of worked to kind of really maximize their margin. Right so, despite all of this stuff, their margin hovers close to 60%. Okay, it's, if you look at kind of their, their, you know, if you look at the annual reports in the last couple years, it's been about, I looked at. carefully, actually yesterday, it's about 57.9% is what they've reported in the last couple of years. So very close to 60% okay? And what that suggests is, you know, hey, you know, even if they salvage the stuff for nothing, right? Like they just threw away stuff, which, by the way, they don't do okay? So when they have a bunch of stuff left over, they do two things. One, they actually do have a clearance, but it's like, very, very limited, right? It's kind of almost like the last week of, sort of the selling season. So it's like, like, way, way far off. And then the second thing that they do, you know, quite a bit off, is they'll effectively get rid of their branding, and then they'll sell, you know, they'll sell their clothes, almost, by the way, effectively, you know, the markets that would never see this sort of stuff, right? So there is some salary value. And so, you know, if we think, think about these things together, and we think about our news vendor formula, which was basically, you know, thinking about the critical fractal, or, you know, the target service rate as being, you know, u over u plus O, right? This was kind of our target service rate. We said, well, hey, you know, with that gross margin being close to 60% this is certainly about a half. And if this is certainly, if this is about a half, what we're thinking is, you know, if this is kind of expected demand, we order a little bit to the right. Why? Because we looked at the news vendor formula. The news vendor formula said, what we should order, Q as u plus K signal, right? And if this u over u plus O is bigger than a half, k is going to be bigger than zero, order a little bit to the right. And then I sort of said, hey, that's kind of not what they do. Ok. They don't do this. We did all this work and thinking about this sort of carefully in terms of the underlying kind of economic principles that we concluded all this nice stuff today, right? And I said, No, actually, kind of not what they George is the left. And, you know, the puzzle I kind of left you guys with was, how does this make sense, right, right? Like, how does what they're doing right jive with what math tells us right? Like we like being kind of driven by sort of quantitative decision making, right? And even qualitative ideas, right? While great, should sort of have a foundation in sort of some form of, kind of quantitative decision making, and this kind of flies in the face, right? So that's kind of the puzzle I left you with. I'm sort of curious about what you think so thoughts,

Speaker 2  5:32  
let's go with James over here. So we were talking a lot about like, what's the lost value of a customer, but is there potentially brand value from scarcity? So that when they are particularly out of stock of something, they have something else coming in the pipeline that that you know scarcity value. Actually, they don't really care if they've quote, unquote lost a customer because they're turning to a new fashion

Unknown Speaker  5:55  
so quickly.

Speaker 1  5:58  
So I guess I push back, right? So why would they not care about losing a customer that's money?

Speaker 2  6:03  
Well, because the customer won't be lost off like a particular item. They would just move to the next item within the

Speaker 1  6:09  
Ah, I see. I really like how you're thinking. So, so let's think about this for a quick second, right? So we talked about u over u plus. O, right. So, so this is kind of like how we're thinking about our critical fractal, right? We're saying our critical fractal is u over u plus. So let's break this down. Let's, let's try and understand what this means in the context of law, right? So, oh, I think that's

Speaker 1  6:45  
it is actually the cable. Okay? So you look at u over u plus, O, right. Let's try and break down what each, each of these things is right. So what's the O? How would we think about O, yeah, yeah, but what does it mean, completely right, like, so if I'm looking at, you know, this shirt, okay, what is O for this shirt? How would you

Unknown Speaker  7:09  
think about the O for the shirt?

Speaker 1  7:27  
Sure, sure. But if I'm kind of like calibrating what o ends up being, how would you think about that? Right? It's what you pay it to make it. It's probably higher than what it costs the gap to make it, because we're sort of vertically integrated in this and that, right? Minus like, what I get, just like the Christmas trees, what I get if I salvage this, right? So, I mean, there's so and let's kind of break this down, right? So we said, like, the gross margin is, you know, let's say 60% right? So let's make up some numbers, right?

Unknown Speaker  7:58  
I don't understand what's going on,

Speaker 1  8:02  
okay, I'll try not to move this right. So let's make up some numbers over here, right? So we're saying, basically, you know, let's say you sell something for $100 right? You know, it cost them $40 to make this, right? So that gross margin is basically 60% okay? And let's say, you know, net of, kind of all these losses that you're talking about, right? Like, if I've got to get rid of this shirt, right? So I've got those extra larges and larges and this and that. I'm not going to get $40 you know, I'm probably not even going to get $40 for it. Maybe I sell it on salvage by weight. Who knows? Right? Let's say I get, I'm making this up, you know, let's say I get. Give me a number. Let's go with the lower, let's say $10 okay, so this is kind of my R, this is my C, this is my v, right? Everybody, everybody go with this. So if I go about it this way, right, my cost of overstocking is 40 minus 10. Uh, that's $30 okay, um, what's my cost of under stocking? $60 right? So, 100 minus 40 to $60 and so, if I go back to kind of this calculation over here, this would suggest you know what we were saying yesterday. You know 60 over 60 plus 30, which is about 66% right, two thirds, right? Okay? And so clearly, that's not what's happened, right? Because if we were 66% they'd be ordering to the right, yes. So if that's the case, you know one of the, you know, one of these calculations has to be wrong, right? Okay, so, so if they're right, like, because they're right, because they're not done, they're not going to leave money on the table, right? No, no. Giant business is going to leave money on the table, okay? And so what's wrong with this calculation? There has to be something wrong here. One of these things has to be wrong, okay, and so James gave us a good start here. So what do we think is wrong

Speaker 3  10:12  
Yeah, let's go. I mean, I don't know about the calculation, but, you know, sorry, fast fashion business, so they're constantly changing their

Speaker 1  10:19  
you don't know about the calculation. What don't you know about

Speaker 3  10:23  
it? No, I'm the one thinking of it is like, you know, the way, the reason that why they order to the left because they're constantly like, changing their products. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  10:31  
They don't want to, but I want you to square that with this.

Speaker 4  10:36  
Okay, let's go with Shira. So in the Christmas trees, example, we had one product, yeah, customer came and there was no product. We lost the customer. We lost the margin. Yeah. Now we have a lot of going to what James said, we have a lot of products. Okay, so it's not like we lose that 60, $60

Speaker 1  10:54  
Okay, good, good. So the claim from both James and Shira, okay, is that okay? This thing is funny, and I kind of agree, but this is kind of questionable. Okay, so what you guys are saying is, the Christmas tree thinking, tells me, if I don't have this shirt to sell to the customer, I've lost the 60 bucks, right? But why is that necessarily the case at Zara? You're saying that's not necessarily the case. So what does the $60 at Zara, right? So, James, you spoke this earlier, what's one of the things that does the $60

Speaker 2  11:28  
at Zara? Well, so they just moved to the next brand, and it

Speaker 1  11:31  
hasn't been on the shelf for long enough. Yeah. So they come back, right? Alexander comes back every two weeks. So, right? Like, maybe, you know, she, we, she didn't buy this this week, right? Uh, let's fly, because she'll come back two weeks from now. I will kind of take her money then, okay, so just because, like, we didn't get her this time, doesn't, doesn't. I mean, I'm not lost her for the whole year or something like that. She'll be back very, very soon, right? What's something else that could balance the $60

Speaker 5  11:59  
Alexis, yeah, we also understand that with a Christmas tree, like one product match with one

Unknown Speaker  12:04  
customer, but here not each product

Unknown Speaker  12:07  
matches customers. Product

Speaker 5  12:11  
matches each customer, different sizes. Customer hit L size, but we have only, like an Excel on S it doesn't

Speaker 1  12:21  
match. That wouldn't work, and that's fine, but, and that goes down in the negative direction, right? What's the same thing in the positive direction? Michael, she's already buying more stuff. He's gonna buy more stuff, right? Exactly like, you know, maybe I don't get exactly this blue shirt that I wanted, but I see a slightly different shade of blue, and I'm feeling adventurous. Seller differentiated blue, right? And

Unknown Speaker  12:44  
sure, sorry about that. Yeah.

Speaker 6  12:46  
10 years ago, a blue shirt in Zara, okay, and it was so good, so little bit like grocery I wanted to buy more of them. But once I was there, like months after, there were no more blue shirts. 10 years after, I still kind of tried to look maybe their back or something,

Unknown Speaker  13:02  
the one that got away.

Speaker 1  13:05  
Okay, so there's two things that actually dull. This, you over here, right? We're saying there's two things that download you. One is that, like, Hey, I not lost the sale, man. Like, just because I lost you on this one shirt, there's two options, right? Like, one, I have a compelling assortment, so maybe you'll buy another shirt. Two, if you don't actually see something in the assortment that you like, you come back two weeks from now. So I'm not lost $60 right? Instead, what have I lost? Right? I've basically lost, you know, $60 times the probability that you won't ever buy anything else from me in the next year, or something like that, right? And that probability is really small. That's that's basically what we're saying. So in reality, the under stocking cost here is not 60, right? Instead, it's 60 times the probability, you know, you won't buy anything else.

Unknown Speaker  13:59  
Everybody see this,

Speaker 1  14:02  
right? And that probability is really small. Why? Because of this is small because of repeat visits

Unknown Speaker  14:12  
and the assortment.

Speaker 1  14:15  
So let's actually take a step back. Okay, let's actually take a step back because it's actually we're really deep, but I want to kind of step back and kind of see what the big picture is over here, right? So let's, like, zoom out and try and understand, like, what, what is kind of the cycle that's happening? Okay? So, so we've talked about everything quantitatively, right? Like, now let's think about things qualitatively, okay, what's, what's actually going on, right? That's our so one way of sort of thinking about it is, but have you ever had, have you had, like, a systems dynamics class? Not yet, right? So they'll do these, like systems dynamics loops, okay, you can have these sort of reinforcing loops, and you can have the opposite of reinforcing loops, things that die out on, you know, in and off themselves. So you'll see this when you do this. In simple terms, a reinforcing loop is kind of like a virtuous cycle. Okay, so the question is, what's the virtue of cycle at Zara, right? So let's say you have rapid rotation of the assortment, right? That's probably one of the first things we talked about when we discussed R on Tuesday. Okay, that like the thing changes really fast, right? What? What is that resulted? Right? We very quickly sort of concluded that what this result this gives us, it gives us a reason to revisit, right? This gives us a reason to kind of revisit the store. So this is like a positive reinforcement, and what happens as a result of this? As a result of this, revisits, those go up, right? So the faster I rotate, hopefully the more revisits I get. Okay, great. If revisits go up. Okay, what happens as a result of this, right? Well, we just concluded, if revisits, go up. My cost of understocking you, what happens to that? That goes down right? U goes down and so as a result of you going down, what happens safety stock goes down, right? I carry less inventory. Okay, so basically, as a result of this, I'm quote, unquote under stocking right. And now what happens as a result of under stocking right? I'm turning faster right, and that's another sort of reinforcing loop. Everybody see this picture? Yeah. So what's actually going on here? What actually is going on over here is coming back to kind of the newsflamder formula. The newsflamder formula said, listen, we've got kind of two levers. We've got uncertainty, right? And we've got this u over u plus O business, right? These are the two left. So the uncertainty part was pretty easy to see right, like it produced closer to season. So uncertainty went down. Great. Sigma goes down. Lower, lower, neutral. But the second big, sort of moving part of the year was encouraging people to come back right. You encourage people to come back a false request, so you encourage people to come back right? Your risk of, sort of under stocking, so to speak, your risk of risk of a lost sale, has gone down. A different way of sort of thinking about this is, they're kind of cultivating LTV, right? They're going from sort of a story where, you know, it's transactional on a sharp to saying, no, no, like we have this kind of long term kind of transactional sort of relationship, right? This is not about a single transaction. This is about managing LTV, by the way, in a couple weeks, when we maybe at the end of next week, I guess, or early in our fourth week, when we talk about demand side lovers, I'll spend a little bit of time talking about LTV and SaaS metrics and things like that, right? Because that's actually very, very closely related to kind of what we're talking about, but fundamentally, very simply, they reduce, sort of the risk of losing me as a customer. That let them under stock still further. Now they can rotate faster and this game. Okay, so let me pause here for questions. And then what I want to do is, I want to talk about, if this is kind of the business model, how do we challenge the model? Right? In particular, there are challenges to this model, and these challenges are pretty, you know, impressive challenges. I want to sort of talk about how they're kind of maybe taking this model and maybe using it to their advantage. Okay, but let's pause here for questions.

Unknown Speaker  18:23  
John, what you had your hand

Speaker 7  18:29  
up for? Up. So this is

Unknown Speaker  18:47  
education

Unknown Speaker  18:51  
approach

Speaker 1  18:52  
altogether, very good. So I think the way you should think about this is the formula Alexa is modularizing, right? It lets us say, How do I go from decisions? Here's the thing, when you make decisions, you're making decisions on individual clocks, right? And that sort of forms a portfolio. Problems, and that portfolio exists at a particular point in time. But what we want to do is we want to connect a portfolio that exists at a particular point in time to kind of long term kind of connections with each of our customers, right? And these are two fundamentally different optimization problems, which we start talking about right? Like I want to please both Michael and Alexandra as long term customers, right? Like I care for them to continuously, sort of come back. It's very hard to sort of think about that in the context of, like a single portfolio. And so what this formula let's do is lets us separate that thing, and lets us separate that thinking exactly to the single number. U, right? So if we think about that single number, U basically be somewhat subjective about it. We can also be fairly positive about it, right? And say, Listen, this is how to make a product, right? Let me look at the devil for this problem, right? What's the chance that, right? Somebody that's in this demo comes back. How often does that person actually come back? Now, it's a once in a lifetime product that you will be pretty close to your gross margin, right? But if it's sort of something that you believe a big portion of your customer risk can buy, you can say, ah, you know, the type of person that buys. This comes by every two weeks, and this is the number of things they purchase. So the chance that I lose that person just because of this is really small, and that's how you can kind of separate long term value thinking from kind of thinking about a portfolio you can reach these students. And so I really like your question, because your question speaks to the opportunity to kind of calibrate these numbers to account for long term value. I'll let you know. Second number, I think those

Speaker 5  20:50  
Yes, second. Sarah is using this strategy basically by by leverage the fact that they're a huge, huge brand, a huge company,

Unknown Speaker  20:58  
not any, let's say

Speaker 1  21:01  
company can do this. The particular reason, I think that's exactly the question I want to ask. So what are the barriers to entry, right? That's your question over here, effectively, yes, yeah, what are your barriers to entry? So hold that thought for a second, because, like, let's, let's talk about challenges, and how those challenges actually came about, right? I also want to acknowledge another point you're making, which is actually a really important point, what is the risk in a business model like this? Right? There are substantive risks in a business

Speaker 6  21:29  
model. Well, currently, WordPress and they have lots of demand, but we've got the best as well. So for instance, if we've got the very kitchen and supply chain on the first stage, then Zara can

Speaker 1  21:40  
reach like the world following this. So they're vertically integrated. As a result of being vertically integrated, maybe they're kind of fragile, right? Maybe they're fragile as a result of being so vertically integrated, right? If something goes wrong, they don't have anybody to turn to. Another way of sort of thinking about that, that vertical integration is the assets that I mean, that's capex involved in this, right? And so you're this is not an asset like business. You're sinking serious dollars into doing something like this. So there's costs that come with doing something like this as well, and that represents a non formula. I totally agree, and we should actually keep that in mind as well as we think about challenging this business model. Let me go to zawa, and then

Unknown Speaker  22:20  
I'll come to you. Anto, they asked

Speaker 5  22:24  
us what items that actually asked there are some stock items that actually stock,

Speaker 3  22:35  
and then there are items, so they need to think about those kind of things. But it goes back across the world. So you may like a particular shift,

Speaker 8  22:45  
but you may find that essentially, in Boston, we didn't do as well. So,

Unknown Speaker  22:55  
experiencing,

Unknown Speaker  23:00  
experiencing difficulties.

Unknown Speaker  23:06  
There are lots of things,

Unknown Speaker  23:17  
and then there

Speaker 1  23:22  
was a time so you're more exposed to supply risk as well. That's another form of being exposed to supply set. Script. So I like this, right? Because basically, what we're seeing is in these business models that turn very fast, right? You're kind of, there's also, sort of the risk of, you're further exposed to suppliers, right? You know, what happens with things like tariffs? What happens with whatever you can get you can get ready to stop. Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  23:52  
Abdullah, I have a question. Second question is, how is Zara know

Speaker 3  23:58  
that customer a has switched from x product to y because x was not available on the floor. So

Unknown Speaker  24:03  
this is

Unknown Speaker  24:05  
to Y. How do, how do they capture that? And

Speaker 3  24:08  
then second, in terms of the risk, wouldn't you say that the Zara, I see that similar

Unknown Speaker  24:13  
products, so that eliminates

Speaker 1  24:15  
a little bit. Yeah, I think that's what we were talking about, right? Like when we sort of thought about the the you, right? We said, Why am I not necessarily losing you on this blue shirt? Because maybe there's another blue shirt that you like, and that mitigates the risk somewhat. And then, you know, if you don't like any of the blue shirts who come, of the blue shirts, you'll come back like in a little bit, right? So that's your second question to your first question. There's a lot of sophisticated analytics around looking at long term behavior of consumers to understand how they substitute over products and how they substitute over time, right? So there's a lot of thinking on a lot of modeling that goes into this. Okay, bottom line, it comes down to collecting data on behavior. Right? If you sort of think about like, what's strategically important, or faculty important to understand that sort of behavior, it simply collecting data. So you know, middle nudges to ask you to log in when you're on the website, or nudges that, like, encourage you to give me information that lets me track you over purchases are very powerful to inform exactly that in my ability, you know, coming back, I'm kind of completely blunt, which is why, you know, people spend all this money on things like loyalty programs and things of that nature. It's precisely to understand the substitution

Unknown Speaker  25:26  
behavior over time.

Unknown Speaker  25:29  
It's all about data. Yeah, okay,

Speaker 4  25:32  
there is a lot of there are a lot of concerns around

Unknown Speaker  25:38  
fast fashion and how

Unknown Speaker  25:42  
sustainable so, how

Unknown Speaker  25:46  
effective? In this cycle,

Speaker 9  25:52  
and how effectively they are, like, like, measuring these challenge costs, like, how much space, and at some point they are

Speaker 1  26:08  
just they might go, Okay, I acknowledge all those points, but

Speaker 9  26:13  
I guess so what? So why is that on those how much cost that they are calculating, and how real and how

Unknown Speaker  26:22  
much sustainability? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  26:25  
I got your

Speaker 1  26:26  
point. So basically, you're saying, Listen, there's kind of like a long term kind of tax that you kind of pay, whatever. Who pays that? Really? I think society pays, I think society pays that cost, right? And so this is kind of like one of these they call tragedy of the commons issues, right? Where, unfortunately, agency over here is between Tsar and its customers, right? And czar is saying, you know, despite what they may say, at the end of the day, it's making money, right? Their company that exists in maximize the amount of money that over the long haul. And as consumers, you know you're saying what you're saying. But consumers are incredibly fickle, and when it comes to kind of, actually putting your money where your mouth is for issues of climate and sustainability, consumers suck, right? Like, there's, like, any number of studies that show that, you know, consumers don't fundamentally care about this issue. A lot of

Speaker 9  27:27  
people talk about it care, but us as business leaders, we

Speaker 1  27:32  
shouldn't care outside. But I think this is my point. So I think like there's an agency issue here, right? If you're just Zara alone, right, your stockholders actually, are they rewarding you for sustainability or not? Right? The short of it is maybe a little bit, but, but not really. And so there's no, there's no everybody pays society, like all of us will face, right? But sadly, you know, individual corporations, just because of how they're rewarded, they're not rewarded on a tenure horizon, right?

Speaker 9  28:07  
Society, I'm

Speaker 1  28:11  
not disagreeing with you, I'm

Unknown Speaker  28:15  
actually a different point

Unknown Speaker  28:24  
of view other than

Speaker 1  28:26  
right? No, no, so I guess what I'm saying is the problem is the problem is much larger than just clothes, right? This issue with sustainability hits everything. I know you guys did your climate simulation or something yesterday, okay, so that hits everything. It's much more than clothes and whatever, right? Like, it hit everything. It hurts, like our like the basic necessities, productivity of food, all this sort of stuff. And in issues like this, right? When you have this sort of tragedy, the commons type stuff, it's very difficult for individual corporations to fix it. Rather, you know, what political economy tells us is that that's something that companies need to help fix, right? Because that's ultimately a government's responsibility, okay? And so, you know, sadly, we're not in an environment that's conducive to this that you probably saw in the news maybe a day or two ago. We're repealing things crazy. So, you know, it's a much larger issue. I think it's very, very important. I don't think I have anything meaningful to sort of, you know, add to it, because it's, something that's so big, you know, what are we going to say at this juncture? I want to come back to what we're talking about over here, and I think you'll really like our next business model with respect to sustainability. I'm joking you're not going to like it at all. It kind of speaks to, it kind of speaks to this gap,

Unknown Speaker  29:48  
okay, your primary

Speaker 2  29:58  
responsibility is your fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. So I'll see you soon, right?

Unknown Speaker  30:03  
Yes,

Speaker 2  30:05  
I totally agree. But until consumers start or shareholders start valuing it. You actually have a responsibility

Speaker 1  30:12  
to maximize profits. That's that's the whole point, right? So that's why I say what political economy again, I want to cut this discussion here, right? But what political economy tells us? Right? It's not like a new problem. This existed over generations, right? For an issue like this, where, you know, an individual corporations agency is to make money, which is what it is, right? Like, that's, that's how the world works, right? To fix these sort of societal bads and societal goods, you need a strong government mandate to do, right? So really, the way this sort of gets fixed is when a large chunk of society wakes up and says, fuck, this is really bad, right? And, you know, we need to, we need to, you know, as a society, we support these policies. I think individual persons, you know, it's very difficult to unilaterally do anything like to this point just now, right? Like, even as a business leader, if you care very deeply about this sort of stuff, and you start making decisions that, yes, they maybe benefit, but the, you know, the the climate, whatever, but they hurt short term profits, you can get sued because that's illegal. So that's, that's how it works, right? And so, you know, I think, I think it'd be great to kind of change this, but those things exist the way they do, for a reason, and the way we're going to fix this, hopefully, is that a large chunk of society starts to care about these issues meaningfully. This is a, this is very much a policy issue. It's a very hard policy issue, by the way, it's going to get fixed with the sorts of simulations that John wrote. I had John join me to do a simulation he did with you guys. I was doing this sort of fundraise thing last year we were setting up this, I think I mentioned to you that we're doing this generative AI consortium, right? So we raised earlier this year, if we raised $30 million as a start thing to just get going, and then our hope is to raise hundreds of millions of the next year. But to get this first 30 million going, we need to get money from a bunch of people, right? And when he did that fundraise, I mean, I had John join on several of these things, and he did a simulation to a bunch of, you know, a bunch of, essentially, these are all C suite people, right? So I do think the simulations are very valuable for awareness, because I think the way corporations can inform policy making is again, through they have tremendous influence on policy right. Corporations lobby for all sorts of things, and so I do think there's a lot of value in business leaders recognizing this. But the way these business leaders are going to transform things, it's hard. It's going to be hard to unilaterally. I think this sort of stuff that John's doing, he's like, super, super important. Okay, so back to back to Zara over here. I think everybody sees this picture. Okay, so now my question is, how do you beat this, right? Stephen, go ahead. So we have a portfolio of probability.

Speaker 9  33:07  
Portfolio. So we put a portfolio of probability, so standard deviation. So I'm just wondering, it's a question, actually, for

Unknown Speaker  33:19  
dynamic system running

Speaker 9  33:22  
clockwise. Is there any forces to make it running?

Unknown Speaker  33:27  
For example, maybe I come to Dara a

Speaker 1  33:33  
few times that I cannot buy these things will cut both ways, right, right? So like if you suddenly slow your rotation or your stuff looks boring, yeah. Why would you do that?

Unknown Speaker  33:48  
Yeah, variabilities can be very high. I

Speaker 1  33:51  
think a different way of sort of thinking about this is, why is there variability? So, why is there variability? What is the source of variability?

Unknown Speaker  33:59  
Yeah, Alexis,

Unknown Speaker  34:02  
media influencers, they're trying

Speaker 1  34:04  
to Yeah, it's fashion in this particular case, right? Like, you know, I don't know. Taylor Swift decides to kind of wear jeans with mismatched socks. And now, I don't know, right, like, and now suddenly everybody wants to wear mismatch socks, because, right, like, because Taylor Swift decide to do it. And, like, you know, that's completely random, right? Maybe she woke up in the morning. It was like, huh, mismatched socks. Who knows what's going on in your head, right? And so that separation in of itself is a totally random process, right? That's fundamentally driving kind of the volatility. And so really, one way of thinking about this is, if you can kind of track that, then you're in good shape, potentially, right? If we can track that, then we're then we're sort of in good shape. So anyways, back to this. How would you want to kind of right like how would How would tell you beat these guys. Fundamentally, entre. Second,

Speaker 6  34:56  
from a very different industry, and I'm trying to make a parallel here I think this purchase cycle in. cycle, in this case, for business, like Angie, is like a vicious cycle, right? If you go to a store you don't see the shampoo you like, you're going to buy the competition. You lost not only that purchase, but that consumer now tried

Speaker 1  35:15  
yes petition. Maybe he liked that. Which is, which is exactly sitting point? Yeah,

Speaker 6  35:20  
exactly. Is there a parallel that can be made? It's probably a little bit. It's not in the same shelf that you're going to find the competition, but maybe the neighbor store has something that you were looking for and didn't find, and you start going

Speaker 1  35:34  
there something. Those are the risks that so that those are things that increase your under stocking cost. That's one way of thinking about it, right? So basically, if you are in an industry where things are super substitutable and you have frequent interactions, you might be allowed to screw up once or twice, but not too often, and then you've kind of not just lost on that one purchase, you've lost on all future purchases. So I think you're absolutely right. This cuts both ways. Right. We have to be very, very careful with this. So we have to kind of embrace the fact that we're actually managing now this long term kind of relationship absolutely, completely

Speaker 3  36:07  
agree. Gary, yeah, I think this is having a decentralized supply chain,

Speaker 1  36:13  
but I kind of pushed back on that, right? Like having a decentralized supply chain, how would you

Speaker 3  36:18  
coordinate that super quickly? So it's going to be a faster decision by not using relying on people. From Zara perspective, they are relying on so many just to fit the data

Speaker 1  36:29  
that's different, though, that's the getting just information from various stakeholders on the ground, right? But a decentralized supply chain would be tough, right? Like, like, imagine, because that's like, more like the banana republic, right, from all over the world. You know, it's gonna take time to coordinate one way or the other. Still, physics. You have to actually, like, people have to learn stuff. You have to ship that stuff.

Unknown Speaker  36:53  
There's a ton of coordination needed online,

Unknown Speaker  36:57  
an online store. What would you

Unknown Speaker  36:59  
do with an online store? So when people buy intent,

Speaker 1  37:07  
okay, good. So you're saying, like, you know, maybe the, okay, so you're saying, you know, the the friction is showing up on a website. So I gotta put back Alexander, so you go to desire twice, websites like, what's your favorite? Like, shopping, website, shopping. Like, let's stick with fashion. With fashion. Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  37:36  
use it for

Speaker 1  37:38  
diminishing my cost of search. So if you're buying like detergent, you buy that online.

Speaker 1  37:49  
But okay, so she doesn't go on. That's not going to work. But let's say there are people that go online, and there's plenty of people that go online. What do you want to do for these people? You want to give them a reason to keep coming back? Yes, that's kind of hard to do. That's really hard to do that's like, like a mythical thing, right? Like, basically, you know, to build like a property where you get a large number of like recurring visitors, you need to kind of be doing something very exciting for them.

Unknown Speaker  38:17  
I think, like more,

Speaker 9  38:20  
I think sour actually, is really struggling in China, not because then their fashion is more proximate. In China, the AI is learning multiple life, and then very quickly they produce. And then their cycle of, like, this whole supply chain system days. So they found one style they like, they make manufacturing in like two days, and then you can stop shipping. So we're

Speaker 1  38:44  
talking about a week now. Okay, so like, fundamental Sanders saying, like, what drove the window? But drove the window here is rapid rotation, that was it. Right. Okay, so let's rotate even faster, right that means yes less sustainability, there's lots of bad things, right, but let's rotate even faster, right, so let's let's think about that for a quick second right if we really take even faster. Then you could repeat the same story right. right? It's rotating even faster. So people come back quicker. I don't have to make a lot, and I just keep pushing this right. So fundamentally, it was not being able to rotate faster. Okay, so, and that's actually a threat to the Zara business model, right? So Zara, basically, they built a built a business model let them rotate at a certain speed, right? It takes them, let's call it on the order of about a couple months right to go through with producing a whole new spot. What if you could do the same thing in a couple days

Speaker 9  39:44  
or a week? The manufacturing is so close that, actually they're so close to the production line, and so the speed of production is even faster. So I think not only supply chain, but also the production becomes so efficient, the color is

Speaker 1  40:01  
like, yeah, okay, good, good. So basically, right? I want to, I want to pick on on your point, right? I want to talk about companies like she and so on and so forth, right? So, if you sort of looked at this picture in 2020, okay, here's what you'd have sort of said. So by the way, in about 2018 I was trying to invest in she and unfortunately, I wasn't able to get dollars, but which I regret. But I tried, so it doesn't matter like so I have no regrets. In some sense, I did manage to invest in a few competitors, which has worked out fine. But in any event, right? So if you looked at this in 2020 this is kind of what you'd look at, right? You'd say, look, there's like legacy players. That's like these people that purchase in 40 weeks, right? This is just the banana republics and all these other times, right? Then you've got like the czars of the world, which, by 2020, was faster than 16 weeks, right? Like, so these guys have gotten it down to purchasing in four to six weeks, and then you can have, you know, players like Sheehan that are kind of doing this in a week. Okay, so if you sort of do this in a week, what's kind of the benefit, right? So this was a picture, you know, a fund I've been talking to, sketched in 2020 this was kind of Shein in 2020 the red line. Okay, this is she, and in 2020, the red line. So Tsar is at the top, over there. Got unique below it. She has kind of already accelerated past, you know, Lululemon, where had a peloton, right? Okay, and what are they doing? They're just turning the stuff over faster. What's the result of turning the stuff over faster this gets to Gary's point, right? So one thing actually, let me start here. I did a presentation to kind of the entire C suite at Nike at some point. And this is from that presentation. This is like four years ago, where, at that point, right, the Sheehan hashtag had about 15 billion views, right? And this speaks to kind of the revisits, right? So basically, they're producing content super fast. Because they're producing content super fast, people want to consume that content, and they show up super fast, right? That creates the same sort of, you know, the same sort of loop, right? To the point that this is also four years ago. Four years ago. This was sort of app rankings and shopping, right? Amazon was at the top. Number two was shipped. In fact, if you look at the stats for this, right, she has effectively been either the number one or number two shopping app in most countries. Okay. So for instance, in the US, they've been number two for an unbroken, unbroken, sort of unbroken Street. It broke because of tariffs, for a little while, I got back on track, right? Um, right. In many ways, it's kind of like, you know, number one sort of website in the world for sort of web traffic and fashion and apparel all this sort of stuff, right? So, tons of tons of traffic. What got them? What got them? How are they able to sort of do this stuff in in a week or two. And by the way, in terms of revenue they're going to they're right at private so they don't, they don't talk about their revenue. But the belief is that they match. They were a billion short of index last year, right? So in 24 they plan to take up to the index. They did not. Inditex landed at 39 billion. The rumor is there 38 in 24 and so this year, they will probably go well beyond some right, which is a big deal, because 10 years ago, they were absolutely nowhere, right? So what gives? How are they able to do this? How are these guys able to pull off what they do, like, what's the what's the magic over here,

Speaker 8  43:38  
great Carlos. It comes to my maybe like simple technique manufacturing. So in a way, there might be, I don't know, the grandpa you really need to need that high manufacturing capacity. Use contract manufacturing.

Speaker 1  43:57  
Speed us up. It's gonna slow us down, right? If you're decentralized, that's gonna slow us down, right? Like, the power of being vertically integrated is, like, everybody works for you, right? Like, you know, I work for Michael. Like, Michael tells me, go do this. I only ever have one customer, Michael, right? That's it. So Michael tells me what to do. He's my boss. I go do it period, right? So that's the power of being

Unknown Speaker  44:18  
vertically. Intro,

Speaker 1  44:23  
it's not an issue of capacity, right? It's an issue of speed. Like how they how they turn things over so fast that feels, that feels tricky. I like where your heart's going, by the way, but you see what I'm saying as well. Next one, this new video, they are

Speaker 2  44:40  
getting information about the products that they will broadcast

Speaker 1  44:45  
and create those I have no problems with that. I think that comes after the fact, right? Like before the fact, I need to have the ability to respond quickly, right? That will inform all of this, right? Like if I have the ability to respond instantaneously, I can get this whole thing to move faster, right? That's the starting point, right? Like, I think about like a chicken and egg thing, right? Like, it's sort of like, first you need to be able to respond quickly, and then all this other stuff flows. And my question is, How did they manage to respond so quickly? How do they pull it off? Right? By the way, in fact, forget my question for a second. Right. Hopefully you see what a key strategic like advantage this is right, like, basically it's allowed them to insert right. And they didn't start big, but they had this core strategic differentiator where they said, You respond in five weeks, I'll respond in one. What can I do if I responded right? And that drove this entire business effectively, right, every everybody sees. So the question is, as an aside, how are they able to pull that off?

Unknown Speaker  45:46  
Sure what they're doing is that they have products, and because they

Unknown Speaker  45:53  
have the data fields

Speaker 4  45:55  
in so they're able to see immediately what works, and then they put it into

Speaker 1  45:59  
mass production. But this goes, this is, again, my chicken. And I think, right? I think if I have the ability to respond quickly, that's great, but if I don't have the ability to respond quickly and have all the data and predictions in the world, so I'm going to help right the point over here is the clock speed of the fashion over here is very, very fast, and then moving with it, which is why they went I went so this has something

Unknown Speaker  46:22  
to do with them.

Speaker 1  46:25  
So the funny thing is, they don't Okay, and I want to kind of step back maybe, and maybe there's a, there's a nice lesson here. This is a lesson here for me. Okay, so I'll tell you the lesson I took away from this, and then maybe you find that useful, too. So how did she install? Okay, so she had started, like 12 or 13 years ago, 2012 or 2013 they started as a company that made wedding dresses, right? So basically, women typically from the US, right? It was typically American women that was like 99% of their market, right? But basically, get in touch with these guys and say, look, here's a really fancy wedding dress, right? But I don't want to pay, you know, whatever a wedding dress costs, right? Like, that's too much. And so, you know, the wedding is okay. And so what they did is they got into this thing of, like, basically making wedding dresses, right? And what they realized in sort of doing this right, was how flexible manufacturing was, where they are fit. Okay? So their primary thing, I believe, is in Shenzhen, when they have places in other parts of the country, right? Chen GE, by the way, in some sense it's expensive, okay, it's not the cheapest place to make clothes. Actually, quite a quite a pricey place when they close, but relative, just like Spain, maybe it's cheap, right? What they found was that the level of talent, okay, that they had around them was very, very different from the level of where the talent was, maybe 10 or 15 years, okay? These, these, these little factories had become super sophisticated so that you could, to someone's point, from earlier, basically give them a design, and they'd actually be able to do this, like, really, really fast. Okay, it's just their abilities change, right? Period, so, but that's still not enough, right? Because, if you sort of think about it, yeah, your abilities have changed, but you're kind of really good, and so, you know, you're in demand. So what did these guys do, right? Which he did, is they invested heavily in a whole bunch of really, you know, manufacturing, sort of, you can think of these as almost like Mom and Pop things, okay, people that will do basically five to $10 million of business in a year, kind of like nobody, right? So these people will do like, five to $10 million of business here, it's really small. What she had said is, we'll come in and we'll set you up with our software, right? We'll give you better payment trips that you get from anyone else. Okay? So, so, like, basically, I think, I don't know what their current payment terms are, but for in many cases, it was like, faster than like, net 30, right? So it's faster payment terms than that 30. You think about like, manufacturing, any other setting. You're thinking like net 60, net 120, things like that, like crazy, right? So they said, listen, we'll set you up with a with with the with the software. We'll give you amazing payment terms, but you have to work with us. Right, that's it. And so what they found, effectively, right, was that, basically, manufacturing, mobility, school. Right, so if you sort of think about you at the start of class last Monday, I said like nothing static, right. So yes, you know, if you think about za. Zara from the perspective of like off. like offshoring in the late 90s But even in the mid to by 32,000. Right, that's very fast. The rest of the world is outstanding, stationary, right. So all of these folks, right, like, basically, they got so good at doing this stuff. They said this is something we can actually turn around in days, actually, right, and of course there are other things over here, right, they found that you know the quality is not very good. Right, so they're able to skip a few steps here and right but that doesn't matter because they. I move, super fast corner in the market, and then we can worry about some of these other things. So, fundamentally what you need to right for Zara which change bizarre, was they invested, super heavily right in, basically this vertically integrated manufacturing. And yes, it you know it's moved on a certain phase it's improved over time and so on and so forth. But what I ended up happening.

Speaker 1  50:29  
was, outside of them, right? Manufacturing just got faster and better, right? And wasn't just one player, like, it got better everywhere at some level, right? I came to these guys here that realized, you know, if I give these manufacturing folks, like, really, really good terms, I don't even need to buy them. I don't even need to take that asset risk, I can still be asset life, right? And produce this fast, this stuff, super, super fast. Okay, I think the interesting question is, you know, where does this go? Right? Like, what, what do we, you know, what do we, what do we do from, what do we do from, from here, right? But I find this to be kind of like a fascinating sort of thing, right? What I think take away from all of this is kind of recognizing what the source of, what the source of the advantages. And so if you sort of think about like the layers we went through, we started with all this news vendor nonsense, right? And we came back and we said, really, you know what's going to drive this was that under stocking business, right? So why was that under stocking cost load? It was basically this, again, there was like driving LTV. They're getting people to come back. And we said, Well, why not? Well, they're getting people to come back because they're changing things really, really fast. It actually comes back to the first thing, you know, Alex said, like when we when we talked about things on on Tuesday, and that was kind of the core of the advantage, right? That was the essence. And so you're able to look at that essence and say, okay, that essence has moved fast, and these guys are kind of moving faster, right? How can we move even faster than that? Who knows, but I can tell you that, like, there's all sorts of crazy ideas out there, right? There's people that are making big investments in 3d printing, right, to do this stuff, so you completely get rid of human beings, right? Like, altogether, and then you then there's zero, right? You can. And this already works for T shirts, right? T shirts are very simple things, right? So you can already, kind of more or less kind of automatically create a t shirt, like entirely reliable, right? For complicated garments, not quite yet, but maybe you can. Okay. And so anyways, this is kind of like the two lessons I want to take away from this, right, and then I want to sort of move on one, right? We want to kind of get to, sort of the essence of like, sort of the differentiation here and the essence of various so just move fast. That was when we threw away all the stuff. We boiled down to basically being able to move fast. What that drove was actually pretty remarkable, right? Move fast equals frequent revisits. Frequent revisits equal No, low U or whatever it is, right? Low u equals, yeah, I can really, actually, genuinely move fast, because I don't have to carry a lot so on and so forth. And so if you identify that one lever, and you tweak that lever, the whole thing kind of can, can tweak faster, right? So that's the big that's one thing. The second big thing I want you guys to take away that now, sort of more magic, right? The second thing I want you guys to take away, which is really related to any of these businesses with inventory, right? This comes back to document a little while ago, right? Anytime you sort of think about about these sorts of things, you want to be able to connect decisions you're making in the moment on a portfolio with customers that care about long term value. These are the two things you kind of need to break okay? You can't kind of think episodically, right? If you think episodically, you're kind of missing the forest for the trees, right? Now, that's exactly what was going on, right? If we thought episodically, we did the wrong thing again. But we did think episodically, we sort of thought about this in terms of, hey, I'm maximizing altogether what I care about. That gets us. Okay? So there's two things I want to talk about. Here's what I want to do next. okay, we could probably discuss this even more but there's fanciest stuff to talk about. Okay. Actually, all the inventory stuff we've talked about so far is relatively simple. Okay. What I want to go to next is. is I want to build towards settings where, you know, we have sophisticated, big, large, distributed supply chain. Okay, that's, that's kind of where I want to move right. And in moving towards that, I want to think about, you know, what happens right when you don't just place orders for inventory once, but you place orders for inventory repeatedly, right? So if you think about this, all of this kind of discussion, boil. to inventory, right? Like everything we talked about, she and Tsar, blah, blah, blah, blah, it was all inventory. And was one style of inventory decision, which was, I have some uncertainty. I want to buy the blue shirts, and then you'll move on after that, directions or whatever, right? But what happens if you're actually making widgets that you sell over time, right? What happens if you have something and you know, it's not like episodic instead, you're selling the same widget over time, right? So a vast majority, actually, of product decisions look like that. So what is inventory management in that setting look like? That's what I want to talk about. Okay, in order to do that, this is slightly more more complicated. In order to do that, I want to talk about two models, because you would talk about the news render, model. We put that behind us for a second. Now I'll talk about two models. The first is something called the EOQ model, okay? This stands for the economic order quantity model, right? Very again, these terms are like, super sexy. They just kind of flow off the top. Here's an EOQ model, right? That's a very simple model, but the simple model will allow us to think about what it means, you know, what are the trade offs right in carrying inventory in the business where you're continuously placing orders? Okay, so I'll talk about that EOQ model, and I want to talk about, okay, if I'm in one of these settings where I need to, kind of, you know, order inventory over time. How do I actually place those orders. How do those systems actually run? Why am I doing this? Because if we understand this, then we're actually going to be able to understand a whole bunch of more complicated things, related to resilience, related to, how do you build a supply chain where you are able to deliver things to your customers in an hour or two hours, things like that, right? So that's where all this is going. Okay? So we try and do as much as we can today, but but this is this is this is this is the story. Okay, so what's the EOQ model EOQ model is really, really. simple, and I can kind of illustrate this model with sort of a story for my life. Okay? And so here's, here's a rough story, which is that, basically, I consume a lot of butter. So a little weird, whereas a little kid, my mother gave me, like, a bunch of this buttermilk, right? It's a weird thing to consume, like, like, whatever she thought was good for me. And I like it. I consume butter. Okay, and we'll see another person's Butterworth and so I'm the only person in my family that drinks this right, I have three kids, I have a wife or whatever the buttermilk is a constant sort of source of contination, right, like, because if I travel the buttermilk goes bad, blah blah blah and it just irritates everybody around, because I'm not drinking like. same dairy products, okay, whatever. So when it comes to the buttermilk, I have a decision, right? So here's one decision, right? So I like the buttermilk. One thing I could do is I could go to this, by the way, it's true, I actually do drink, okay? So I could go to the store every day and buy, like, the small bottle of buttermilk. Okay, you got a tiny bottle, right? And I could go to the store every day and I could combine buttermilk, right? This has pros and cons, right? The benefits of this are, my family doesn't get irritated, right? Like, because, like, it's a tiny bottle. It's not going to get in anyone's okay. It's not going to go bad, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever, right? That's good. I'm not carrying much inventory. What's bad about this is, I'm lazy. I've got to go to the store every day to get this, and this is going to be a pain, yes, right? The alternative, which, in my case, I prefer, is buying a lot of money, right? And so this way I don't have to go to the store very often, because I always have butter, right, but I'm going to consume a lot of, you know, fridge real estate and doing this, right? So effectively, I have a trade off to make with the butter, right? Like, do I want to consume a lot of fridge real estate, have a lot of inventory, right? I risk, like, you know, all the financing costs of the buttermilk, right? The buttermilk might go bad, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? And that's higher over here, but I've less, less trips to make to the store. Alternatively, more trips to the store, but very little. Okay, so these are the trade offs I need to make, right? And most businesses need to make trade offs like this, okay? What drives these trade offs? What drives these trade offs? Ultimately, again, we'll talk about in a clinical example that I'm going to work through in a second, right? What drives these sort of sorts of trade offs is basically the trade off between kind of fixed costs associated with orders, right? There are oftentimes fixed costs associated with orders, with shipping or logistics or whatever, right? And you'd ideally like to advertise those fixed costs across a large order, right? You might even get, like, volume discounts or whatever. Again, the source of this is amortization. Right? The alternative right is basically, you know, if I, if I, if I place, so that would be one large order, right? So if there's one large order, I basically amortize those fixed costs very nicely, but then I carry a lot of inventory, and then I pay lots of costs associated with carrying that inventory. Alternatively, I could carry very little inventory, and my inventory costs would go down, but then I pay more of those fixed costs, right? Like every time I place an order, presumably I'd be paying for these fixed costs. So this is kind of the trade off. Okay, so given this trade off, I wanted to work through a very simple kind of clinical example, right? And and where this clinical example is going to take us, either at the end of today or sometime tomorrow, right? Is how state of the art kind of inventory systems actually work, again, thinking about how the place works, right? So here's, here's the question, and we're going to start very simple. So this is some, some I don't know, computer company or whatever, right? And they make computers, and, you know, let's say they put memory chips in their computers. And, you know, the memory chips, you know, each cost $45 okay, that the company that the assembler has to buy from, you know, overseas, okay, in addition, right? Each time they place an order, it costs them $500 right. So this is like, the logistics, the customs, the processing, whatever it is, okay, so $500 you know, fixed cost, right? And in addition, you know, you play holding costs of 45% by the way, when I say holding costs of 45% this is how holding costs are often talked about. Okay, so when people talk about holding costs, and they give you a percentage, when they say 40% or 30% or 20% what they're really saying is this, right? What that corresponds to in dollars is, you ask yourself, what is the average inventory, right? So let's say you figure out that the average inventory you carry is $100 million okay, so at any given time you have $100 million right? Then, if your holding costs are I'm taking this out 45% what that translates to. to is $45. Million in inventory holding costs over a period of a year. Okay, so the key thing that is the year. Okay so basically you look at what is your average inventory electricity carry. multiply that by that percentage is basically how much you're effectively paying only costs over here. okay, how this is typically top okay, so this is my problem, right? all right, so now and what's my decision? Right, really one way of kind of thinking about my decision here is, every time I place an order. How many chips. I order as basically medicine? Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay, so let's actually sketch a picture of what might actually happen. Okay, let's, let's look at this with a picture. So let's say, every time I placed an order, I ordered Q chips. Okay, the number Q. We've got to figure out what Q is, but let's say I ordered Q chips. Okay, so I ordered Q chips, right? What's going to happen? So that's my inventory. The inventory just came in. What's going to happen after this? I'm going to go down, right? I'm going to go down in a straight line, okay, I'm going to go down in a straight line, something like this, right? This line here? No, this would be Q, over D, but what's the slope of this line? Exactly like negative d, right? So my rate, let's say, of demand, is 400 chips a week, or something like that. Over here, the slope of this line is 400 chips a week. Negative 400 chips a week. Does that make sense? Okay, so basically, I started with Q. My demand is 400 chips a week in time, Q over D, I sold out of chips. So let's say Q was 800 right? So I ordered 800 chips. I consume 400 chips a week, so I'll be done in two weeks, right? Make sense, okay? And then I place an order for Q again, okay? And, you know, this whole thing, this whole thing effectively, effectively repeats, okay, so what I'd like to do basically, is figure out what Q That's basically the question we need to ask them, right? The question we need to ask is, what is q? And so, um, so, how should we do that? How should

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21  
we set all this up? I don't want the answer. How should we set all this up? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:03:28  
camera, that's like an optimization problem, right? Where a decision variable is cute. We'll have a whole bunch of things associated with this optimization problem you probably need to figure out. Probably need to figure out what our objective is. We need to optimize that objective, right? So let's actually set up our optimization problem. Okay, so let's actually set up that optimization problem, right? So first off, right, what's our decision? Variable, quantity, right? You Sorry.

Speaker 4  1:04:02  
Okay, so our decision variable over here is q, yeah, that's the order quantity,

Speaker 1  1:04:09  
right? That's our decision variable. But what are the various parameters of this system? Okay? So what is demand? I'm going to keep demand to be deterministic for now, right? So let's call that d. In our setting, demand was 400 per week. And every time we do this, by the way, I'm going to convert demand into units of demand per year. Why? Because I'm going to measure inventory cost annually, so I want, it'll make sense to look at demand annually. Okay, so demand is 400 chips a week, which so per year, that's, you know, 400 times 52 that's about 20,800 chips for you. Everybody good with this? Okay, that's one thing, right? What's another parameter is, how much does a chip cost, right? So, the chip, let's call that C, right, so that's $45 like, let's call that our purchasing per unit, unit purchasing cost, right? So that's $45 then we have a fixed cost. I'm going to call that f, you know, that's $500

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23  
right? This is fixed cost

Speaker 1  1:05:26  
per order, right? And then finally, we have inventory holding cost, which is 45% okay, so that's, that's kind of the set right. Now, really, what we have to figure out is, what's our objective. So these are, like, sort of the, these are the parameters. The question is, what's our objective? So somebody helped you with the objective. Qualitatively, what is our objective over here Gary, minimize what? Minimize cost about meeting demand. Okay, I like that, right? So we don't want to you might satisfy all the demand, but we want to minimize cost.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:07  
What? What is cost? Consistent,

Speaker 1  1:06:16  
number of orders, absolutely, right. Now, the interesting thing is price that's really relevant, right? Because if I'm satisfying all the demand, I forget demand times 45 whatever it is, that part kind of goes but there's the holding cost, right? So really, I have two, two sort of strategies of the American order a lot, and then I have high holding costs or a little low holding cost. There's two components to cost over here. One is basically, how much are you paying in inventory holding costs that's going to kind of capture the financing costs and salvage costs and all those kinds of things, right? The second piece of my cost is kind of fixed cost, the cost every time at this moment, right? Everybody, give me these two pieces of cost, right? So really, in English, what is my objective? And then we'll kind of be quantitative, quite it, right? My objective in English is I want to minimize holding cost plus ordering cost, right? This is kind of what I want to minimize. Make sense, right? English, good. Let's make this quantity. Okay, let's make this picture Quantum. So I've just cleaned up what I wrote over here on the slide, right? So let's make this picture Quantum. Okay, so this is kind of what our inventory thing is going to look like, right? This is our picture if we ordered Q, right? This is what took a snapshot of what inventory look at something like over the course of E. So let's look at this picture. Okay? And let's try and understand how this picture breaks down into kind of right holding cost on the one hand, right? What's the holding cost associated with this picture, and maybe what's the ordering cost associated with this picture?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:03  
Okay, so that's garbage, no. Okay, let's do this step by step.

Speaker 1  1:08:10  
So, and we're going to do this together. Okay, so, so if you look at this picture, what's the average amount of inventory you're carrying over here, shut up, Q divided by two. Right? Because we start at Q, we go to zero, start at Q, go to zero, and we go linearly to zero. So it's Q divided by two, right? The average inventory over here is q divided by two. Average inventory that's simply q divided by two,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38  
okay, what's the average value of the inventory

Speaker 1  1:08:44  
camera? Absolutely. So it's Q over two, which is the average inventory multiplied by the unit cost of inventory, which is C,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:52  
right? So the average inventory value is a

Speaker 1  1:08:59  
that's going to be c times, which is the unit cost Q divided by two. Okay.

Speaker 5  1:09:07  
Questions about this, we know what the average inventory value

Speaker 1  1:09:14  
is, okay, so if I remember what I said earlier, right? We'd ask ourselves, okay, if the average inventory value that we're carrying over here is $100 million to figure out inventory cost, we just multiply that by that percent, 45% or whatever it is, right? CQ over two is kind of like $100 million right? That's what CQ over two. And so we need to now multiply this by, you know, the 45% of whatever we were told in this particular case, you know, I don't know what the what it was 45% and we call that h, right? We call that percentage H. So our holding cost, right is the 45% which is basically h times c, Q over two, okay, yes. Uncle, just, can you go back to the Q over 2y? To two? Yeah, because you start at Q, and then you go to zero, and you go back to Q, and then you go to zero. So if you look at your inventory over time, right? It starts at Q, it goes to zero, it goes back up to Q, goes back to zero. So you take that average, that's going to be q divided

Unknown Speaker  1:10:24  
by two, that's okay, perfect.

Speaker 1  1:10:31  
So good. What we're assuming over here is everything works like popular, right? So basically high depression, right? So basically we started something that goes to zero. As soon as it goes to zero, we got our new order right, like that, which is why you just have fun, right? You start go to zero, and then there's few order Okay, so now we've actually got to figure out ordering costs, right? And so we sort of think about ordering cost. We have to ask ourselves, first of all, how many orders do we place? Right? So let's talk about as follows, right? In a year, what is the demand that we're serving 20,800 odd chips, right? So if every time I order chips. I order 1000 chips. How many orders would you place in a year? 20,800 divided by 1000 How about 21 orders? Make sense, right? So the total demand I divide by the amount I order every time I place an order, that's my total number of orders of the year, right? So let me say that again. So that makes sense, right? Says Right. Like so, given a year I ordered 20 my demand is 20,800 chips, right? And per share point, I've got to serve all that demand. I have to order 20,800 chips over the course of a year, right? But every time I order, I only order, let's say, 1000 chips. So that means that the number of orders I have to put is 20,800 divided by 1000 that's 20.8 roughly 21 Okay, so what does that mean in, I don't know variables over here, right? We're basically saying that the number of orders that we'll place over the year, okay, is the total demand over the year, the 20,800 that's D, okay, divided by the amount I order every time I order. What is the amount you order every time you order? Q? So I divide by q. So my number of orders is d divided by q, okay. Everybody with me, okay, so what's the cost associated with these orders? What's the fixed cost associated with these orders, 500 multiplied by this. And we call 500

Speaker 5  1:12:40  
F, right for fixed cost. So the ordering cost over here

Speaker 1  1:12:48  
is simply F times d divided by two. Everybody good with this. So what's my total cost? Right now, that I've gotten this, here's my total cost, right? It's holding cost which we calculated as HC, Q divided by two, okay, plus ordering cost which we calculated as f, d divided by q, okay. So if I come back to this sort of picture over here, I know what this is. This is, right? C times, I'm sorry, h times, CQ divided by two. This ordering cost is FD divided by two. Okay, so all we've done is, by the way, right? We've said, Listen, I care about figuring out, you know what your optimal ordering quantity is. These are kind of my parameters right, demand, how much does a unit of inventory cost? How much like me every time I place an order? What's my holding cost? And putting these things together, we got these two terms right. One term that corresponds to the holding cost, the other term that corresponds to the order, okay, I want to understand these costs. Okay? And I think it's helpful to kind of draw a picture.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04  
Let's draw a quick picture.

Speaker 1  1:14:06  
Make sure we understand these costs. Okay, so, so I'm going to look at the cost on the y axis, and I'm going to look at how the cost changes as a function of the quantity I ordered on the x axis. Okay, this is what I this one I like to look at. And so first, let's start with the holding cost. Okay, let's start with my holding cost over there, which is my first term, right? What's the shape of the holding cost curve? What does holding cost look like as a function of q? What's that shape? First of all, is it increasingly. It's clearly increasing, good. What's the shape? Linear? It's a straight line, right? Look at it. It's CQ over two. So it's a straight line, okay? So it's a straight line that's going to look, you know, something like this, right? So

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57  
this is H, C,

Speaker 1  1:15:01  
Q, okay, that's that's that cost? Yeah, okay, now let's look at that ordering cost. How do you think the ordering cost behaves with Q, right? Is it increasing or decreasing with Q? It's decreasing, right? As Q gets larger, the ordering cost gets smaller, which is what we expected, right? We amortize that fixed cost over more and more, you know, inventory, right? And the ship over here, it's one over q, right, like one over x, right? So it's got this kind of hyperbolic shape to it, okay? And so what does that look like? Well, that looks something like this. I this one over x, right? So, so what is this? This FD divided by two. All right, so this is, this is, this is our ordering cost. This is our holding Okay, so what's our total cost? Our total cost is going to be the sum of these two curves, right?

Speaker 5  1:16:03  
Our total cost is the sum of these two curves. So what does that sum of these two curves look like?

Speaker 1  1:16:10  
Go ahead, yeah, it's going to have, like, some kind of minimum, right? So if you sort of think about it, we're adding this out, right? And it's probably going to get low over here, and then we're going to add it up, it's going to get high over here again, okay, so if I add up these two curves, I'm probably getting a curve that looks something like this,

Speaker 3  1:16:31  
right? Our total ordering cost, which is the sum of these two curves.

Speaker 1  1:16:38  
And where is the minimum of this thing, okay, it turns out that the minimum exactly exists, exactly at the point where the holding cost equals the ordering cost. Okay, the minimum is going to be exactly here. Okay, so in this case, it's going to work out that the minimum is exactly what the holding cost equals the ordering cost. All right, okay. So if we're saying that the holding cost equals the ordering cost, god damn this I need, I'm gonna, like, have a fit one day. Okay, so what we're saying is we want holding costs. Do you want this point over here. So how are we going to get to that function? Okay, I want, right? Let's work that out over here again. I'd like you guys to help me with this, right? So in English, I'm saying I want holding cost

Unknown Speaker  1:17:30  
to equal quartering cost. This

Speaker 1  1:17:37  
is what I like, Okay, this is what I like, right? So let's, let's figure that out, right? So what was holding cost? It's CQ over two, right? It's CQ over two. And ordering cost was FD divided by q. So I want to pick a Q so that these two quantities are the same, right? That's basically what I'm saying. So all I gotta do is solve for q, right? So let me solve for q. So I'm gonna do that Q over here, right? That becomes q squared, and we take everything else on the other side. So this two goes over here becomes two times FD, and this HC goes into the denominator, right? So I need q squared to equal that quantity, or equivalently, I want Q to equal the square root of 2f, D divided by H, C, okay, okay. So we've solved an optimization problem. The details already matter, by the way, right? But the thing that I want you to take away is what we did is we said, Listen, I solved this problem of too much better than the person's too little, right? How do we formalize this? We formalize this by saying, Hey, I got a holding cost that's associated with like me ordering, having lots of inventory. I've got these fixed ordering costs associated with me placing frequent order. I need to balance these two costs right, and so we carefully balance these two costs, and it very cleanly tells us that if I balance these two costs right, this is what we need to do. Okay, if we want to balance these two costs really, we're going to order something that depends on all of these things. It depends on demand, right? It clearly depends on demand, right, like because we said, we have to satisfy all demand. So it depends on demand. It depends on our fixed cost. The higher the fixed cost, the higher our orders. As you can see, f is in the numerator over here. It also depends on the holding cost and the unit cost of the product. If this is an expensive product, if C is very high, you're not going to order a lot of it. Equivalently, if your holding costs are very high, you're not going to order a lot. Okay, and so if now we work this out in kind of the context of, you know, of our, of our problem over here, right? What does this work out to be? You know, in this context, right? Somebody help me with this. What are we going to get here?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:04  
So what's, what's, what's the cue that solves this? I

Speaker 1  1:20:11  
mean, don't tell me the number, just, let's just work it out great. So what types times 500 because f times demand, which is this, 20,800 remember everything in years, right, divided by ch, C is 40 5h, is 45% so point four, five and that whole thing works out to be about 1013 units, 1013 chips. Everybody doing this? Okay, good. This is kind of like a warm up. All right, here's what I want to I want to stop here, but before I stop, I want to kind of give you guys a little puzzle that I'd like you to think through for tomorrow. Okay, there's no pick up here tomorrow, and then we'll discuss the case. But here's the question, what's missing, right? So, what did we discuss? Right, by the way, what are we building up here? Right? We're building up here to follow. Why am I talking about all this? Right? Here? Am I talking about all this? We're going into Monday, right? I want to sort of think about where retail is going purely right, so, you know. So for instance, like, literally, a couple months ago, Amazon, for the first time in its history, had higher revenues than long Okay, these are both giant players, right? Like, Walmart is, like, literally the biggest employer. So these are like big, big players. And so there's like dislocation happening in pretty significant industries, right? And so really, where I'm going, where Monica is, I want to sort of ask, just like you talk about Zara, right? And she and this and that, that's like, almost like a mini problem, right? So I want to say, at the scale of all of retail, which is $2 trillion right? What is the big moving pieces, right? Now, one of the things that's going to inform these big moving pieces is all these guys have to carry a ritual, right? They sell you your laptops, they sell you everything, right? And if I sort of think about it, what they're managing, that picture looks exactly like. It's no different, except that they're managing this problem not on one unit, on one product. They're managing this problem on literally hundreds of millions of products. Okay? And so we're building towards that optimization problem, towards that optimization problem, because we want to get kind of a boot of what's going to drive this right? That's why we're doing this. Okay, so that's why we're looking at a picture like this in the first place, right? Not because we're going to manage this, but rather because we want to get to that. U over. U, right? So anyway, so with that in mind, we're looking at a picture like this. It gives us a rough sense of what we ought to do, but I want you to think about between today and tomorrow, not capture me. Okay, so that's what I'd like you to think about, and we'll pick up on that, you know, first thing tomorrow. We'll spend the first 35 minutes of class, wrapping this, discuss your case and then Monday we launch into thinking about you know the Walmart stuff.
