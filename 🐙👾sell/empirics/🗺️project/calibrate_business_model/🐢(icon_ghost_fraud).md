Four intellectual traditions have grappled with entrepreneurship's fundamental paradoxâ€”how ventures create the realities they inhabitâ€”yet each captures only fragments of this phenomenon.

Operations management, from Taylor's (1911) scientific management to the Toyota Production System (Womack, Jones, & Roos, 1990), perfected coordination within stable constraints, achieving remarkable efficiency when inputs and outputs are well-defined. Yet as Skinner (1969) presaged, strategic alignment assumes an existing reality to align with; entrepreneurship inverts this logic, requiring founders to architect the uncertainty structures that make coordination possible. The operational question transforms from "how do we efficiently produce X?" to "what belief distribution about X enables the collective action necessary to manifest X?"

Statistics and decision science promised rigor under uncertainty, beginning with Knight's (1921) distinction between measurable risk and unmeasurable uncertainty. Savage's (1954) axiomatization offered entrepreneurs the apparent comfort of expected utility maximization, assuming stable probability distributions and fixed preference orderings. Yet behavioral decision theory shattered these foundations; Kahneman and Tversky (1979) demonstrated that human valuation dynamically reframes with context, making preferences endogenous to choice architecture. Entrepreneurs face an even more radical entanglement: the act of articulating new possibilities simultaneously transforms both probability assessments and utility functions, requiring mathematics that captures this co-evolution.

ðŸš¨To operationalize this co-evolution of belief and choice, we point to advances in probabilistic AI. Instead of relying on opaque deep learning models, **probabilistic programming** can explicitly represent the entrepreneur's "world model" and the reasoning of stakeholders within it. This approach is particularly suited for **rational meaning construction**, allowing the system to interpret the intended meaning of ambiguous but critical entrepreneurial artifactsâ€”such as term sheets, SAFE notes, or vision statementsâ€”and infer how a rational agent would act upon them. By formalizing the entrepreneurial promise as a probabilistic program, we create an interpretable, human-like reasoning system that can support complex decision-making in open-ended environments, a core vision of this research paradigm.ðŸš¨

Entrepreneurship theory evolved from opportunity discovery to opportunity creation. While Shane and Venkataraman (2000) framed entrepreneurship as recognizing and exploiting pre-existing opportunities, Alvarez and Barney (2007) distinguished creation from discovery, arguing that entrepreneurs often construct the opportunities they pursue. Sarasvathy's (2001) effectuation logic formalized this insight: expert entrepreneurs begin with available means rather than predetermined ends. Yet the field remains bifurcated between normative prescriptions and empirical descriptions, lacking a unified framework for how entrepreneurs design uncertainty structures that simultaneously inspire action and maintain credibility across heterogeneous stakeholders. Strategic management reconceptualized strategy from planning to sensemaking. The dynamic capabilities perspective (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997) locates competitive advantage in firms' ability to reconfigure resources, yet assumes an existing firm with established routines. Earlier, Cyert and March (1963) recognized firms as coalitions with divergent goals, requiring strategy to function as organized sensemaking (Weick, 1995) that creates interpretive convergence from ambiguity. Our contribution formalizes this process: strategy becomes a designed uncertainty structureâ€”a Beta(Î¼, Ï„) distribution calibrated to generate useful predictions across diverse prior beliefs while preserving sufficient flexibility for pivoting when those predictions meet market reality.
