## need
Von Hippel and Von Krogh (2016) identifies the need-solution pair. Their need was different problem solving framework due to expensive cost and constraint on solution candidates that problem formulation process induces. Their solution was "need-solution pair" framework. 

Angie's need is to understand how innovation differs in the "niche competitors" and "technical advances" period from Fig.1. Hopefully need-solution pair can be one solution.

To pair the two concepts, simple analysis is done as below.
