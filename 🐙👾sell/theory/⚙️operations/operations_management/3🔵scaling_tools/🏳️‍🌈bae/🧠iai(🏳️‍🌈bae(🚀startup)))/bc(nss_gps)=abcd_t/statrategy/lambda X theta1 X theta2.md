Startup takes action (hire customer service staff or implement chatbot) in response to the extracted information (e.g. customer doesnâ€™t like waiting) so Bill wants to make sure startup operate with more accurate target f(C(5,5) , A, B), not f(C(1,1), A, B) where C(n,t) is estimated result with sample n and time t.

C is estimator of D. 

Time to get intern/worker!

How startups form DEFENSIVE PRIOR by simulation testing (~rejection sampling)

Jeff simulates every scenario from [organization X strategy] combination given fixed idea. Then he takes action by changing parameter space (hire developer, pivot strategy) to defend against the worst outcome.

--- e.g. --- 
lambda (idea): sell books on the internet

theta1 (strategy): ip, disrpt
theta2 (organization): (R&D, Developer) -> (R&D, Developer1, Developer2), (R&D1, R&D2, Developer)


: scenario from best to worst
1. theta1 = ip, theta2 = (R&D1, R&D2, Developer)  -> commits to ip strategy, gets patent (uncertain)
2. theta1 = disrpt, theta2 = (R&D, Developer1, Developer2)
3. theta1 = ip, theta2 = (R&D, Developer1, Developer2)
4. theta1 = disrpt, theta2 = (R&D1, R&D2, Developer) -> 

action: update theta2, hire one more developer
- to prevent worst scenario: hire one 
- to pursue best scenario: commits to ip strategy, hire one more R&D
