how many customers to interview
i-core suggests 100, delta-v suggests 20, 

- supplier to make it work (complex material); shirt would break their machine

vensim proposition
don't show up, not in our universe (programming language - do what you want)
- sd (model gets made for one decision, nail it by getting, scaling)
- enroad (success of scaling) - make model accessible vs project model
tool (that does sth) - 

mit crowd, get focused feedback

comment on forthcoming sd review
how to solve their problems (resource)

how many customers to interview?

costly in america
what is N the function of?
- market, frontier, 
1. two models:
- find the frontier then innovate (customer pull)
	- burger king, 
- innovate then find the frontier (tech push)
	- mcdonald,

store investment in infrastructure (staff)

e.g. startup: pure software and hardware (generative AI, ministry of supply)
e.g.2. established: microsoft generative AI, Hyundai EV architecture

should not only see the competitors in the market but also the 
1. importance of differentiating stock and flow in market

- test to segment: how similar is enough
- ROS design and sample size decisions (16.6 design analysis using fake data simulation): marginnote3app://note/B9F6F9AB-1238-45B6-BE90-24A867BDCAA9
- pragmatism organization marginnote3app://note/B9F6F9AB-1238-45B6-BE90-24A867BDCAA9 "conclusion can be reasonably asserted if the number of observations is sufficient, which raises issues of statistical and experimental validity, for instance, sample size, stability of experimenting conditions, etc. While deduction is purely logical, induction is contingent on the conditions of experimentation, for example, the accuracy of measurement devices. If the acceleration of falling objects is measured with 1 percent accuracy, the tested law (9.8 m/s2) is confirmed; with a ten times higher 1% accuracy, it is falsified: The gravity acceleration is not the same at the poles (9.78 m/s2) or at the equator (9.83 m/s2). In both cases (deduction and induction), the theory—that is, the general rule, for example “Human beings are mortal,” “all objects at the surface of the earth fall with the same acceleration g”—is given, as a general rule to apply (deduction) or as a proposition to test (induction). Thus neither deduction nor induction introduces any novelty into the situation. Peirce then defined hypothesis creation, “the logic of discovery,” as the third type of inference, to explain how new propositions can be introduced in reasoning: Abduction is “the only logical operation which introduces any new idea”ABDUCTION 191 (Peirce, 1931–1958, 5.171). It is the class of reasoning that, in an ambiguous situation that challenges habitual interpretations, reassembles unexplained and scattered facts into a plausible and testable hypothesis and enables actors to proceed to experimentation: “The surprising fact C is observed, but if A were true, C would be a matter of course; hence, there is a reason to suspect that A is true” (Peirce, 1931–1958, 5.189). Contrary to deduction, which moves from general to particular, or induction, which moves from particular to general, the conclusion of abductive reasoning tells us something more than what was already known in the premise. Abduction invents something new, a distinct law, a different story. That is why, in Peirce’s perspective, it holds the prime role, accounting for “all the operations by which theories and concepts are engendered”

## design data experiment via simulation
action space: 
data space: 
product
- case study, documentation
- hire ui developer, 
- publicize
- reach out to the community for unifying data standard
- taxanomy

what kind of data are we expecting to see

idea - strategy - path
- will 3d printed wrench do the job (effectiveness - bit_supply)
- could we make the wrench with 3d printer easily, cheaply, and fast? (efficiency - atom_supply)
- will potential customer accept plastic wrench? (satisfaction - customer)
- durability of wrench (will it last the same amount of its kind)
can it be made with durable?
