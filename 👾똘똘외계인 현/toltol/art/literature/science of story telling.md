### **1. "Humiliation is acid"**

- **Meaning**: Humiliation _corrodes_ a character‚Äôs constructed identity (their "theory of self"), exposing raw vulnerability.
- **Example**:
    - _King Lear_: A king who bases his worth on power and flattery is humiliated when his daughters strip his title, guards, and dignity.
    - **Acid Effect**: His royal identity dissolves ‚Üí "Is man no more than this?" (Act 3, Scene 4).

---

### **2. "Pour it slow"**

- **Meaning**: Humiliation must be _gradual_ to maximize psychological rupture.
- **Example**:
    - _Breaking Bad‚Äôs Walter White_:
        - Step 1: Strip status (Pinkman calls him a "joke" in front of dealers).
        - Step 2: Expose need (Cancer diagnosis forces him to confront mortality).
        - Step 3: Dissolve self-theory (His "family man" persona rots into "Heisenberg‚Äôs" cruelty).

---

### **3. "Strip status"**

- **Meaning**: Remove external markers that prop up the character‚Äôs ego.
- **Examples**:
    - _Game of Thrones‚Äô Cersei Lannister_:
        - Shame walk through King‚Äôs Landing (hair shorn, naked, jeered) destroys her "queen" identity.
    - _The Godfather‚Äôs Michael Corleone_:
        - Attempted assassination in his home strips his illusion of safety ‚Üí "It‚Äôs not personal, Sonny. It‚Äôs strictly business."

---

### **4. "Expose naked need"**

- **Meaning**: Force characters to confront their deepest insecurities.
- **Example**:
    - _Fleabag_ (S2):
        - The Priest rejects Fleabag‚Äôs advances ‚Üí her "I want to be loved" confession cracks her cynical armor.

---

### **5. "Watch the 'theory of self' dissolve"**

- **Meaning**: The character‚Äôs foundational beliefs about who they are shatter.
- **Example**:
    - _Othello_:
        - Iago‚Äôs lies humiliate Othello (calling him a "cuckold") ‚Üí his identity as a noble general dissolves into jealous rage.

### **6. The Arc: "Crown ‚Üí Madness ‚Üí Raw Love" (Lear‚Äôs Path)**

|**Stage**|**Lear‚Äôs Journey**|**Modern Equivalent**|
|---|---|---|
|**Crown**|"Love me most, get the largest kingdom!"|Tony Stark‚Äôs ego: "I am Iron Man."|
|**Madness**|Roars at storm: "I am a man more sinned against than sinning!"|Walter White‚Äôs breakdown in the crawl space.|
|**Raw Love**|Cradles dead Cordelia: "Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life‚Ä¶?"|Logan‚Äôs final sacrifice for Laura in _Logan_.|
