## **POMS Journal Application Guidelines**

### **Literature Integration**

- **E (Evidence)** should prioritize operations management, supply chain, and quantitative business journals
- Cite foundational OR/OM theory in Evidence layer
- Use Explanation layer to connect classical OR to entrepreneurial contexts

### **Mathematical Content**

- **P (Point)**: State what the model/result accomplishes
- **E (Evidence)**: Present equations, proofs, or mathematical derivations
- **E (Explanation)**: Interpret mathematical results for managerial implications
- **R (Repeat/Link)**: Connect to next methodological step or result

### **Empirical Sections**

- **P (Point)**: State the empirical question or hypothesis
- **E (Evidence)**: Present data, results, statistical tests
- **E (Explanation)**: Interpret statistical significance and practical importance
- **R (Repeat/Link)**: Bridge to next analysis or broader implications

## **Common PEER Violations to Avoid**

❌ **Multiple Points**: Trying to make several arguments in one paragraph  
❌ **Missing Evidence**: Making claims without supporting citations or data  
❌ **Weak Explanation**: Presenting evidence without interpreting its significance  
❌ **Abrupt Transitions**: Failing to link paragraphs logically  
❌ **Buried Point**: Hiding main idea in middle or end of paragraph

## **PEER Templates for Different Paragraph Types**

### **Problem Statement Paragraph**

- **P**: "Problem X is complex/challenging because..."
- **E**: Literature showing problem difficulty, failed solutions
- **E**: Why existing approaches are insufficient
- **R**: "This necessitates a new approach that..."

### **Methodology Paragraph**

- **P**: "We address this challenge using approach Y"
- **E**: Technical details, equations, model structure
- **E**: Why this approach is suited to the problem
- **R**: "This framework enables us to..."

### **Results Paragraph**

- **P**: "Our analysis reveals finding Z"
- **E**: Specific results, numbers, statistical significance
- **E**: Practical interpretation and implications
- **R**: "This suggests/enables/leads to..."

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Draft Point sentences first** - Create paragraph outline using only P sentences
2. **Test skip flow** - Ensure P sentences tell complete story
3. **Add Evidence layer** - Support each point with citations/data
4. **Develop Explanation** - Interpret evidence thoroughly
5. **Craft transitions** - Link paragraphs with R sentences
6. **Final skip test** - Verify logical flow remains clear
