## how to check being understood?
remember sth, eye contact, paraphrasing back, asking question, new connections, name what you're doing (introducing keyword), think of you and understands, have the conversation to understand (even for yourself), feeling of sth change, interruption

## experiment observer, listener, speaker on problem solving of research
- sharing from personal experience (having toolbox of resonating experience is good),
- observer (notice as conversation unfolded, did the speaker or listener do anything that impacted the conversation)listening with problem solving
- Q. what's the best way to learn the listener's "intention" 
- -> be very explicit on "i wish to get feedback on xyz" (need intentive listening; heard, helped, hugged; inform, request, feedback 요청, 피드백요청, 업무지시)
- -> is it a good time  to talk about xyz (do you have capacity to )

## diversity
neurodiversity (differences in the way people's brains work;  idea is that there's no “correct” way for the brain to work), 
different in terms of background, broader interest, race, ethnicity, communication style 

- need different evaluators (eye) e.g. instead of nutrition of food, storage of food matters (extend model boudnary)


navigating differently, what i'd do about it?



what could pi do to create a climate ("is it ok to broach")
- invite external expert
- regularity of meeting (together and set this time apart)
- big things start from small thing and should be continuous

- create consistent learning opportunities
