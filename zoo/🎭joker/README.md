## 🔄 Four Moments of Model Evolution

### 1. Birth (탄생) 
- Angie + Charlie collaboration (2023)
- Supply chain → Value chain transformation

### 2. Trinity in Unity (삼위일체)
- **Capability Chain** (🟢): Design → Develop → Launch
- **Fulfillment Chain** (🔴): Produce → Distribute → Deliver
- **User Chain** (🟣): Demand → Design → Develop

### 3. Name and Flesh (이름과 실체)
- **Deliverability** = P(coordinating goal with capabilities)
- **Sellability** = P(compelling user with offering)
- **Unit**: $/time (value per time)

### 4. Vision (비전)
- Entrepreneurs as new users of operations management
- Deliver compelling theories for entrepreneurs
- Improve reality with and as entrepreneurs

## 📊 File Classification Matrix

| Chain | Focus | Key Question | Folder |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 🟢 Capability | HOW we can | Can we build it? | 🐢can |
| 🟣 User | WHO needs | Will they want it? | 👾user |
| 🔴 Fulfillment | WHAT we deliver | Can we ship it? | 🐙offer |
| 🌊 Integration | WHY it matters | Does it create value? | 🐅goal |

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Low User Variability → Exploit
- Fast food, commodities, generic drugs
- Focus on efficiency and scale
- Files go to: 🐙offer/📦operation/

### High User Variability → Explore  
- Fashion, luxury, entertainment, education
- Focus on innovation and differentiation
- Files go to: 👾user/🌱life/ or 🐅goal/🤜proposal/

## 🔗 Cross-Chain Connections

```yaml
deliverability_path:
  - 🐅goal → 🐢can → 🐙offer
  
sellability_path:
  - 👾user → 🐅goal → 🐙offer

balance_equation:
  success = optimize(deliverability × sellability)
```

*"Why so serious?" - Because balancing dreams with reality is the entrepreneur's eternal joke.*
