In terms of **framing the final narrative** to motivate understanding of PCS theory, the manuscript could leverage the contrast in a storyline format. For example, one effective approach might be to **open with the Segway saga** as a cautionary tale – painting a narrative of an innovation that began with world-changing promise but faltered due to fragmented perception, haphazard sequencing, and poor coordination. Detailing a few key scenes (Segway’s hyped unveiling, the lack of a defined user need, the regulatory roadblocks) will immediately ground readers in real-world stakes and naturally raise the question: “What went wrong, and how could it have been done differently?” This sets the stage by implicitly introducing the PCS components as critical factors. The manuscript can then **pivot to the Sublime Systems story** as a contemporary contrast that answers that question. By narrating how Sublime’s founders approached a very different but equally daunting innovation challenge with a methodical, phased strategy, the author can illustrate each PCS element in practice. For instance, the text might describe how _perception_ played a role – Sublime identified that the key to unlocking progress was convincing a third-party lab of their cement’s viability (thus zeroing in on the right problem to solve first). Then, it can show _sequencing_ – how they staged their experiments and engagements in a clever order (e.g. conducting internal tests to gather data, then simultaneously showing results to regulators, customers, and investors) instead of rushing a big launch. Finally, _coordination_ comes through in anecdotes like Sublime aligning an ecosystem of partners (testing agencies, pilot customers, and funding sources) all in concert, leading to milestones such as the net-zero building demo pour and accelerated funding[news.mit.edu](https://news.mit.edu/2024/sustainable-cement-startup-sublime-eliminates-co2-gigatons-0809#:~:text=In%20May%2C%20Sublime%20reached%20a,online%20as%20early%20as%202026). By weaving these episodes together, the narrative demonstrates how each step of the PCS framework directly contributed to Sublime’s momentum – essentially providing a positive mirror image to the Segway story.

The **juxtaposition** of the two cases can be a powerful framing device throughout the manuscript. After explaining each PCS stage via Sublime’s case, the author might briefly **reflect back to Segway** – e.g., “Had Segway’s team applied such concurrent stakeholder coordination, they might have foreseen and mitigated the infrastructure and regulatory issues that later stymied adoption[innovationmanagement.se](https://innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/02/a-lesson-in-innovation-why-did-the-segway-fail/#:~:text=2,user%20feedback%20or%20iteration%20in)[innovationmanagement.se](https://innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/02/a-lesson-in-innovation-why-did-the-segway-fail/#:~:text=5,it%20was%20not%20properly%20anticipated).” These comparative insights reinforce the theory: readers see clearly how _Perception, Sequencing,_ and _Coordination_ are not just abstract terms but the very differentiators between a stalled innovation and a thriving one. In conclusion, **Sublime+Segway** provides the most instructive and engaging pairing. It allows the final narrative to be framed as a lesson in contrasts – from a famous failure to an emerging success – thereby compellingly motivating why the PCS framework matters. By the end of the manuscript, an innovation scholar reading it should intuitively grasp the PCS theory, remembering how each component was embodied in the rise of a climate-tech solution and conspicuously missing in the fall of a once-hyped gadget. Such a narrative not only **grounds the theoretical framework in storytelling** but also inspires a deeper appreciation of strategic foresight in innovation management, which is exactly the goal of illustrating the PCS theory with real cases.

In contrast, entrepreneurs who sequence actions by breaking their biggest uncertainty first often progress more efficiently. In the **Sublime Systems** case, the founders identified the technical viability of the new cement as the biggest risk (if the cement couldn’t meet strength and safety standards, no amount of customer interest or investor money would matter). They devoted their meager initial resources to a series of rigorous lab tests and small pilot pours, _before_ scaling to a full plant. The first lab validation immediately unlocked a customer letter-of-intent (the pilot construction firm was willing to try it), which in turn made the investors comfortable enough to provide seed funding – a chain reaction that addressed uncertainties one by one. Notably, after the lab test, the “uncertainty penalty” $\lambda_{\text{tech}}$ for the scientist stakeholder plummeted (the technical doubts were largely put to rest), and even $\lambda_{\text{customer}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{investor}}$ dropped as each saw others’ positive responses. The team then used the new funds to do a pilot project with the customer, further reducing market and scale-up uncertainty. By the time they needed big money for a production facility, all major stakeholders were already on board with high confidence – making the Series A fundraising straightforward. This stepwise de-risking reflects a **state transition** in the venture: initially the state $S$ was highly uncertain (high $U_j$ across j), but after each bottleneck action, the state transitioned $S \to S’$ with strictly lower total uncertainty. STRAP explicitly plans for such **state transitions** $D(S, a) = S’$, seeking to **stabilize the venture’s trajectory** as early as possible. By the time Sublime moved to scaling, the venture’s path was almost deterministic – success was by no means guaranteed, but the range of outcomes was well-understood and narrow. This contrasts sharply with Segway, which remained in a probabilistic flux far too long, essentially still experimenting (with the market) at a stage when they thought they were executing. STRAP’s sequencing module thus provides a disciplined way to choose experiments: always spend yMy next dollar where it yields the largest reduction in the chance of failure. By following this principle, entrepreneurs can conserve resources and **build real options**: at any point, if the uncertainties resolve negatively, they still have resources left to pivot or try something else (whereas an undisciplined approach might exhaust resources without ever illuminating the path to success).
