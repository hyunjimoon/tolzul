## User √ó Offer Analysis

### User Profile (üëæ)
**Who**: Entrepreneurs seeking operational excellence
- Pain: Traditional OM theory doesn't speak their language
- Need: Frameworks that balance growth (explore) with efficiency (exploit)
- Context: High variability in user chains, need for experimentation

**Key Insight from Joker**: Entrepreneurs need OM theory that embraces uncertainty and variability, not just optimization

### Offering Design (üêô)

   - "Operations for Entrepreneurs" course (with Vivek)
   - Workshops on balancing deliverability and sellability
   - Case method teaching with joker's triangular framework

2. **Theoretical Tools**:
   - Value chain management framework with $/time metric
   - Decision support for explore vs exploit contexts
   - Probabilistic models for entrepreneurial operations

3. **Practical Applications**:
   - Templates for capability-fulfillment-user chain mapping
   - Diagnostic tools for identifying operational bottlenecks
   - Strategy guides for different variability contexts

## Value Creation Formula

**For Low Variability Contexts** (McDonald's, commodities):
- Focus on exploit strategies
- Minimize experimentation cost
- Optimize existing chains

**For High Variability Contexts** (Zara, luxury, education):
- Focus on explore strategies
- Worth creating new users
- Experiment with chain configurations

## Compelling Proposition

- Integration with existing entrepreneurship education

## Deliverability Assurance
