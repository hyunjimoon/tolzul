# Zoo Keeper's Guide

You run a special zoo with four animals:

🐢 **Turtle** - Slow but sure, knows every method
🐅 **Tiger** - Bold visionary, sees the future  
👾 **Alien** - Strange visitor, brings new needs
🐙 **Octopus** - Eight arms creating offerings

## Daily Routine:

**Morning Check**: Which animals are awake?
- Draw them in your daily log
- See who wants to play together

**Afternoon Pairing**: 
- 🐅 + 🐢 = Can we deliver?
- 👾 + 🐙 = Will they buy?

**Evening Feeding**: 
- Good connections feed the animals
- They grow stronger for tomorrow

## The Secret:
$/time is the food that flows between them all.

## Your Job:
Keep the zoo simple. One drawing per day.
When animals connect well, everyone thrives.
